Mixed xenogeneic bone marrow reconstitution (mouse + rat----mouse) results in stable mixed lymphopoietic chimerism (1-48% rat), long-term survival, and the induction of stable functional donor-specific transplantation tolerance to xenoantigens in vivo. To examine the role of negative selection of potentially xenoreactive T lymphocytes during tolerance induction across a species barrier, mixed xenogeneic chimeras (mouse + rat----mouse) were prepared and analyzed using a mixture of mouse and rat bone marrow cells for relative T cell receptor (TCR)-V beta expression on mouse T cells. In mixed xenogeneic chimeras (B10 mouse + rat----B10 mouse), T cell maturation proceeded normally in the presence of rat bone marrow-derived elements, and functional donor- specific tolerance to rat xenoantigens was present when assessed by mixed lymphocyte reactivity in vitro. V beta 5, which is expressed at high (undeleted) levels in normal B10 mice, was consistently deleted in B10 recipients of Wistar Furth (WF), but not F344 rat bone marrow, whereas the coadministration of either F344 rat or WF rat bone marrow with B10 mouse bone marrow cells resulted in a significant decrease in expression of TCR-V beta 11. Taken together, these data demonstrate for the first time that rat bone marrow-derived cells can contribute in a strain-specific manner to the ligand for negative selection of specific mouse TCR-V beta during tolerance induction across a species barrier.
