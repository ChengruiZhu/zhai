, prolonged the latent period by more than 100 per cent. The rate of increase during the period of rapid rise was similar in the presence or absence of DRB, but the yield was markedly reduced at the end of this period in the presence of DRB. The amount of the virus in the membranes continued to rise in the presence of DRB and eventually approached the maximal levels reached much earlier in the controls. Measurement of the amount of virus in the media indicated a greater degree of inhibition than did measurement in the membranes. Comparative studies with two benzimidazole derivatives on the dependence of the inhibitory effect on the time of addition of the compound showed that processes which could be inhibited by DRB were of shorter duration than those inhibited by 2,5-dimethylbenzimidazole (MB). With MB the relationship between the time of addition and the inhibitory effect was similar both for virus and for soluble complement-fixing antigen; with DRB the inhibitable processes were of shorter duration for the complement-fixing antigen than for virus particles. DRB was not only 35 times more active on a molar basis but also was more selective in its action than MB. DRB interfered with processes which preceded the emergence of either soluble complement-fixing antigen or virus particles. Some of the implications of these findings are discussed in relation to the mechanism of inhibition of influenza virus multiplication by benzimidazole derivatives.
