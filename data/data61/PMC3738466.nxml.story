To build meaningful representations of the external word, the stream of sensory information that reaches our senses is continuously processed and interpreted by the brain. Ultimately, such a processing allows the brain to arrange sensory (e.g., visual) inputs into a hierarchy of categories (such as animate and inanimate objects) and sub-categories (such as faces, animals, buildings, tools, etc). Crucially, while many objects can be assigned to the same category based on their visual similarity (e.g., oranges and apples), formation of most categories also requires arbitrarily associating objects sharing similar functions/meaning, but not similar shape (e.g., bananas and apples). A long-standing debate exists about whether the representation of visual objects in the higher visual centers of the brain (such as the inferotemporal cortex; IT) purely reflects shape similarity or also (and, perhaps, mainly) shape-unrelated categorical knowledge. In this study, we have addressed this issue by applying a variety of computational approaches. Our results show that the response patterns of a population of inferotemporal neurons are better accounted for by shape similarity than categorical membership. This reasserts the primary function of IT as a visual area and demonstrates how state-of-the-art computational approaches can advance our understanding of neuronal coding in the brain.
