The assembly in living cells of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding proteins from their constituent α, β, and γ subunits is a complex process, compounded by the multiplicity of the genes that encode them, and the diversity of receptors and effectors with which they interact. Monoclonal anti-β antibodies (ARC5 and ARC9), raised against immunoaffinity purified βγ complexes, recognize β subunits when not associated with γ and can thus be used to monitor assembly of βγ complexes. Complex formation starts immediately after synthesis and is complete within 30 min. Assembly occurs predominantly in the cytosol, and association of βγ complexes with the plasma membrane fraction starts between 15–30 min of chase. Three pools of β subunits can be distinguished based on their association with γ subunits, their localization, and their detergent solubility. Association of β and α subunits with detergent-insoluble domains occurs within 1 min of chase, and increases to reach a plateau of near complete detergent resistance within 30 min of chase. Brefeldin A treatment does not interfere with delivery of βγ subunits to detergent-insoluble domains, suggesting that assembly of G protein subunits with their receptors occurs distally from the BFA-imposed block of intracellular membrane trafficking and may occur directly at the plasma membrane.
