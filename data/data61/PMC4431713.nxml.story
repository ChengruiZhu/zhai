In treating cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, it is crucial to decide whether one is treating pre-emptively or if one is treating established disease. Disease may be further divided into viral syndrome and tissue-invasive disease. Generally, mild disease in immunosuppressed patients may be treated with oral valganciclovir. Treatment may also be started with valganciclovir for CMV retinitis in AIDS patients. In other tissue-invasive syndromes, starting with intravenous ganciclovir or foscarnet at full doses (adjusted for renal function) is preferred. Treatment at full doses should be continued until symptom resolution and until blood antigenemia (or DNAemia) is cleared. Patients receiving treatment must be closely monitored for side effects to the drugs, as well as for response. Drug-resistant CMV is a therapeutic challenge; combination therapy with both ganciclovir and foscarnet may be tried. In extreme cases, resorting to unconventional agents like leflunomide or maribavir may be necessary. Immune reconstitution, through reduction in immunosuppression, or the introduction of anti-retroviral therapy, should be attempted. CMX001 is a novel agent active against double-stranded viruses; thus far, resistance to CMX001 does not confer resistance to ganciclovir or foscarnet. Hence, prophylaxis or pre-emptive treatment with CMX001 may allow the use of ganciclovir or foscarnet for treatment.
