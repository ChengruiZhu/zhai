Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a terrible and ultimately fatal childhood progeria often caused by mutations in the CSB chromatin remodeling and DNA repair protein. A piggyBac transposable element invaded the CSB gene about 43 million years ago, before humans diverged from marmosets. However, this last common ancestor “domesticated” the “selfish” invader, and our CSB locus now encodes both the original CSB protein and a novel CSB-piggyBac fusion protein joining the first third of the CSB protein to the piggyBac transposase. Although likely to be advantageous in health, expression of the conserved fusion protein in cells lacking any CSB-related protein induces a strong interferon response that may explain the brain calcifications seen in advanced CS. To determine whether continued expression of the fusion protein in CS patients affects the severity or heterogeneity of the disease, we identified all genomic binding sites for the fusion protein experimentally. We find that the fusion protein is tethered by protein–protein interactions to at least three transcription factor binding motifs on DNA (AP-1, TEAD1, and CTCF motifs). The tethered fusion protein regulates nearby genes, including some that may induce the interferon response. Our data suggest that drugs or biologicals targeting innate immunity and inflammation may benefit CS patients.
