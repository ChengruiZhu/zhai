 hybridization (FISH) in exfoliated bladder cells in the urine of patients with BTCC. Serum total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant status (TAS) and oxidative stress index (OSI) were measured. Significant differences were observed in the abnormal CSP3, CSP7, CSP17, GLPp16 signals and FISH positive rate between patients with BTCC and healthy controls (P<0.001). Serum TOS, TAS and OSI were also significantly different between the two groups (P<0.001). The clinical stage of BTCC was not associated with abnormal CSP3, CSP7, CSP17, GLPp16 or FISH positive rate and oxidative stress (P>0.05). A Gamma rank correlation analysis revealed an association between the pathological grade of BTCC with abnormal CSP3, CSP7 and CSP17 as well as FISH positive rate (P<0.001). In addition, the clinical stage of BTCC was associated with serum TOS, TAS and OSI (P<0.001). Evaluation of the association between chromosomal aberrations and oxidative stress revealed that abnormal CSP3, CSP7 and CSP17 were positively associated with serum TOS and OSI (P<0.001), abnormal CSP7 and CSP17 were negatively associated with serum TAS (P<0.001), but abnormal GLPp16 was not associated with serum TOS, TAS or OSI (P>0.05). Therefore, the chromosomal aberrations of exfoliated bladder cells in the urine are associated with blood oxidative stress in patients with BTCC, and these factors may contribute to the occurrence and development of BTCC.
