The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and potential pitfalls of selective neck dissection of levels II-IV in controlling occult neck disease in clinically negative neck (cN0) of patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Charts of 96 consecutive cN0 laryngeal cancer patients undergoing 122 neck dissections at the University of Florence from January 2000 to December 2004 were reviewed. N0 neck was defined with contrast enhanced computed tomography scan. Occult neck disease rate was 12.5%, involvement per level was: 47.6% at level II, 38.1% at level III, 9.5% at level IV. Six patients developed neck recurrence (6.25%) after selective neck dissection of levels II-IV within the first two years after treatment. In conclusion, selective neck dissection of levels II-IV is effective in N0 laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma; posterior limits of surgical resection are missing therefore if post-operative radiation is required, the field should be extended beyond the dissected levels. The low incidence of occult neck disease indicates the need to refine treatment strategy, restricting elective neck dissection only to supraglottic T2 with epilaryngeal involvement, supraglottic T3-4 and glottic T4 tumours, and considering a "wait and see" protocol implemented with imaging techniques and cytological assessments for other lesions.
