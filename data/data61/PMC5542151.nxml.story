26 patients (28 knees) were identified, 17:9 M:F, and average age 33.7 years (21-49 years). A total of 34 Outerbridge grade IV cartilage lesions were treated, 10 lesions on the MFC, 6 on the LFC, 13 on the patella and 5 on the trochlea. Average cross sectional area of the lesions was 3.075 cm2; average area of MFC lesions was 2.844cm2, LFC 2.69 cm2, patellar lesions 3.795cm2, and trochlea lesions 2.195 cm2. Associated procedures included patellar realignment in 16/28 (tibial tubercle osteotomy in 12, VMO advancement in 4); 6 MPFL reconstructions and 10 lateral releases. ACL reconstruction occurred in 7/28 knees and partial meniscectomy in 9. There were 11 returns to the OR, 3 for MUA, 9 for arthroscopic debridement (including 5 hypertrophic graft tissue, 1 loose body and 2 further microfractures of a prior or new lesion). On MRIs at 6 months post-op. The average MOCART score was 54.7 (range 20-85). 12/17 had fill of the defect, 3 had >50% fill; 10 had full border integration and 5/17 were isointense on T2. More than half of patients with greater than 1 post-operative MRI showed a progressive increase in their MOCART score with increasing time since surgery. Average pre-op Lysholm score was 51.99 (SD 15.24, range 29.17-68.76). At an average of 4.8 years post-operatively, the mean Lysholm was 86.37 (SD 10.72, range 70.84-100). This improvement in Lysholm scores was statistically significant, p< 0.001.
