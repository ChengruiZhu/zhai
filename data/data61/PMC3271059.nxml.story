Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, pathologically characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta brain region. Mutations in α-Synuclein or gene duplication or triplication result in autosomal-dominant inherited PD. Indeed, aggregated and insoluble α-Synuclein is found in Lewy bodies, a pathological hallmark common to both sporadic and hereditary forms of PD. In order to better define α-Synuclein's pathogenic mechanism, we first used a fly genetic screen to search for novel genetic modifiers of mutant human [A53T]α-Synuclein neurotoxicity. We identified the mitochondrial chaperone protein TRAP1 as a novel modifier of the toxicity induced by [A53T]α-Synuclein. [A53T]α-Synuclein–induced toxicity was enhanced when TRAP1 expression was decreased, while overexpression of human TRAP1 (hTRAP1) provided a rescue. Cell culture experiments further demonstrated that [A53T]α-Synuclein directly interferes with a number of mitochondrial functions, including Complex I ATP production, mitochondrial fragmentation, and sensitivity to oxidative stress. These effects could be blocked by TRAP1 overexpression. As mitochondrial dysfunction has previously been linked to mutations in several other genes associated with genetic PD, these data provide further evidence of a common mitochondrial-centric mechanism of PD pathogenesis.
