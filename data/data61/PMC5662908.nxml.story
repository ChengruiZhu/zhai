Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide and is also associated with a poor prognosis. As in numerous other types of cancer, galectins have been demonstrated to be involved in the progression of lung cancer. Galectins belong to a superfamily of lectins, which are carbohydrate-binding proteins. There are at least 15 members in the galectin family, however, only galectin-1, −2, −3, −4, −7, −8, −9, −10, −12, and −13 are found in humans. Galectins are able to mediate interactions between cells, including homotypic and heterotypic interactions; they also facilitate the bindings between cells and extracellular matrix components. These cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, as well as the galectin signaling on the cell surface, are able to modulate signaling pathways and thereby influence cellular functions and behaviors. Galectin-1, −3, −4, −7, −8 and −9 are associated with lung cancer. These galectins are associated with tumor invasion, migration, metastasis and progression, and may serve important roles in the tumor microenvironment of lung cancer. The majority of galectins are associated with the progression of lung cancer, with the exception of galectin-9, which is associated with enhanced anticancer immunity. Therefore, galectins may be potential targets for developing novel lung cancer therapies.
