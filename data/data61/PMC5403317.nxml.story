Although Wilms tumor 1 (WT1)-associated protein (WTAP) was initially found to be a specific WT1-binding protein, it has increasingly attracted attention because of its oncogenic role in various types of malignancies, including cholangiocarcinoma, glioblastoma and acute myeloid leukemia. However, the clinical impact of WTAP on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is still unknown. A total of 145 patients who underwent surgical treatment from 2004 to 2008 were enrolled in the present study. The cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of WTAP in tumor and adjacent normal tissues was examined by immunohistochemical analysis in order to investigate the relationship between WTAP and the clinicopathological factors and prognosis of patients with PDAC. The nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of WTAP in tumor tissues was significantly higher compared with non-tumor tissues (P<0.001). High expression of WTAP in the nucleus was significantly associated with gender (P=0.010) and tumor stage (P=0.020), while high expression of WTAP in the cytoplasm was significantly associated with gender (P=0.018), histological grade (P=0.047) and perineural invasion (P=0.028). In addition, a univariate analysis revealed that high nuclear expression of WTAP in tumor tissues was significantly associated with poor overall survival (P<0.001), as well as several clinicopathological variables, including gender and N stage. In a multivariate Cox regression analysis, nuclear WTAP expression was identified as an independent prognostic indicator for PDAC (relative risk, 1.855; 95% confidence interval, 1.033â€“3.333; P=0.039). The results of the present study indicated that high nuclear expression of WTAP is a valuable molecular biomarker of a poor prognosis among patients with PDAC.
