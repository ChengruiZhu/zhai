The prevalence of hepatitis B and C in patients with glioblastoma multiforme or meningiomas has not been described. These infections are known to modulate the activity of the immune system, which potentially influences the development and course of cancer. We hypothesized that chronic hepatitis infection, which activates the immune system, decreases the risk of brain tumors, particularly those that are highly malignant. We performed a retrospective study to examine the prevalence of hepatitis B and C in patients with meningiomas and glioblastomas. The combined prevalence of hepatitis B and C in the USA from 1999–2008 was 5.7%. The prevalence of hepatitis B and C in patients with meningiomas was 2.4%; while among glioblastoma patients, the prevalence of hepatitis B and C was 1.38%. The odds ratio of having hepatitis B or C with glioblastoma versus meningiomas was 0.56, with a confidence interval of 0.19–1.6 and a P-value of 0.29. Compared with historical controls, the prevalence of hepatitis B and C in meningioma and glioblastoma patients was decreased. However, this difference may be attributed to the retrospective nature of our data and the natural history of hepatitis B and C infections. The prevalence of these viral infections was not statistically different in patients with meningiomas and glioblastomas. This suggests that hepatitis B and C primarily influence slow-growing, benign tumors and more aggressive cancers equally, if at all. To definitively test our hypothesis, future studies in which data are prospectively gathered are likely to be required.
