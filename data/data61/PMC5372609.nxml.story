Astaxanthin alleviates hepatic lipid accumulation and peroxidation, inflammation, and fibrosis in mice with high-cholesterol, high-cholate, and high-fat (CL) diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). It has been proposed as a potential new treatment to inhibit the progression of NASH in humans. In this study, we compared hepatic gene expression profiles after treatment with astaxanthin or the antioxidant vitamin E in mice with CL diet-induced NASH. Comprehensive gene expression analyses of the livers of mice fed a standard, CL, or CL diet containing astaxanthin or vitamin E for 12 weeks were performed using a DNA microarray. Both astaxanthin and vitamin E effectively improved gene expression associated with eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (EIF2) signaling, which is suppressed in NASH by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the liver. However, astaxanthin did not improve the expression of genes associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Astaxanthin, but not vitamin E, was predicted to suppress the actions of ligand-dependent nuclear receptors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, (PPAR) α (PPARA) and PPARδ (PPARD), and to affect related molecules. Establishing a new therapy using astaxanthin will require elucidation of astaxanthin’s molecular action on the functions of PPARα and related molecules in the livers of mice with diet-induced NASH.
