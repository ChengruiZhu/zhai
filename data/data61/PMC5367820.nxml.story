Parameter estimation from data is an important part of mathematical modeling, and structural identifiability is the study of what parametric information exists, for a given model, in ideal data. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, there is often less information available in our real data sets. The study of these problems is called practical identifiability. In this study, we consider a family of models of cancer biology that are commonly used to explain cancer incidence in terms of underlying biological parameters. Using profile likelihoods, a widely applicable numerical tool, we demonstrate that even though the more complex models we consider have theoretically more identifiable parameters, the data contains only three pieces of practically identifiable information for each model: the product of the initiating mutation rates, the net cell proliferation rate, and the scaled malignant conversion rate. This result can be interpreted biologically: we can determine only the product of cell mutation rates not the intermediate rates themselves. Our result limits the interpretability of previous work, but we propose a novel parameterization to resolve the identifiability issue. Ultimately, our analysis demonstrates the importance of verifying the practical identifiability of parameters before assigning too much weight to the interpretation of their estimated values.
