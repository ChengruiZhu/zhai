Caloric restriction (CR) can delay onset of several age‐related pathophysiologies and extend lifespan in various species, including rodents. CR also induces metabolic remodeling involved in activation of lipid metabolism, enhancement of mitochondrial biogenesis, and reduction of oxidative stress in white adipose tissue (WAT). In studies using genetically modified mice with extended lifespans, WAT characteristics influenced mammalian lifespans. However, molecular mechanisms underlying CR‐associated metabolic remodeling of WAT remain unclear. Sterol regulatory element‐binding protein‐1c (Srebp‐1c), a master transcription factor of fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis, is responsible for the pathogenesis of fatty liver (steatosis). Our study showed that, under CR conditions, Srebp‐1c enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis via increased expression of peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator‐1α (Pgc‐1α) and upregulated expression of proteins involved in FA biosynthesis within WAT. However, via Srebp‐1c, most of these CR‐associated metabolic alterations were not observed in other tissues, including the liver. Moreover, our data indicated that Srebp‐1c may be an important factor both for CR‐associated suppression of oxidative stress, through increased synthesis of glutathione in WAT, and for the prolongevity action of CR. Our results strongly suggested that Srebp‐1c, the primary FA biosynthesis‐promoting transcriptional factor implicated in fatty liver disease, is also the food shortage‐responsive factor in WAT. This indicated that Srebp‐1c is a key regulator of metabolic remodeling leading to the beneficial effects of CR.
