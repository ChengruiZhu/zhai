Heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) is highly expressed in many cancers, and its prognostic and predictive value has been reported. HSP27 knockdown using siRNA or OGX-427 (an anti-sense oligonucleotide sequence targeting HSP27) is reported to have anti-cancer effects and to enhance chemosensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents. However, conflicting results have been reported regarding the clinical significance of HSP27 in bladder cancer (BC). Furthermore, long-term suppression of HSP27 has not been investigated in BC. In this study, we investigated the association between HSP27 expression and BC characteristics in 132 BC patient samples, as well as its prognostic value to determine the potential of HSP27 as a clinical biomarker. Additionally, we applied five different shRNAs targeting HSP27 in three invasive BC cell lines to analyze the long-term knockdown effects of HSP27. Our study revealed a significant association between HSP27 expression and adverse pathological characteristics such as high-stage and -grade BC. However, HSP27 expression was not associated with clinical outcomes such as tumor recurrence, progression, and patient survival. Interestingly, although our shRNAs had obvious knockdown effects on HSP27 in BC cells, we did not find consistent effects on apoptosis of BC cells or chemotherapeutic sensitivity of BC cells to cisplatin. Therefore, although HSP27 may be a predictor of adverse pathological characteristics in BC, its role as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target seems to be limited.
