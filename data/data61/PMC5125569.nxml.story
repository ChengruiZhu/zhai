How extracellular electric fields—as generated endogenously or through transcranial brain stimulation—affect the dynamics of neuronal populations is of great interest but not well understood. To study neuronal activity at the network level single-compartment neuron models have been proven very successful, because of their computational efficiency and analytical tractability. Unfortunately, these models lack the dendritic morphology to biophysically account for the effects of electric fields, and for changes in synaptic integration due to morphology alone. Here, we consider a canonical, spatially extended model neuron and characterize its responses to fluctuating synaptic input as well as an oscillatory, weak electric field. In order to accurately reproduce these responses we analytically derive an extension for the popular integrate-and-fire point neuron models. We show that the dendritic cable acts as a filter for the synaptic input current, which depends on the input location, and that an electric field modulates the neuronal spike rate strongest at a certain (preferred) field frequency. These phenomena can be successfully reproduced using integrate-and-fire models, extended by a small number of components that are straightforward to implement. The extended point models are thus well suited for studying populations of coupled neurons with different morphology, exposed to extracellular electric fields.
