The ever increasing interventional CVD outcome studies have resulted in statins being an essential factor of cardiovascular prevention strategies. The JUPITER study in 2008, despite reducing CVD and overall mortality, highlighted an increase in new onset diabetes in the rosuvastatin treated arm. Since then there have been many meta-analyses of the RCTs and the largest carried out by Sattar et al showed a significant increase in the incidence of diabetes during the trials. The findings from the individual studies when comparing the different statins were less clear. A higher statin dosage and risk factors associated with diabetes appeared to predict this phenomenon. There have been many studies investigating the effects of statins on glycaemic control, but again no clear conclusion is apparent. Despite the increase in new onset diabetes observed, the risk is clearly out-weighed by the CVD benefits observed in nearly all the statin trials. Thus, no change is required to any of the prevention guidelines regarding statins. However, it may be prudent to monitor glycaemic control after commencing statin therapy. This review will focus on atorvastatin which is the most widely used statin worldwide and rosuvastatin which is the most efficacious. This will be against a background of the effects of other statins on glucose metabolism in non-diabetic patients.
