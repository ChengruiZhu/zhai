Of 205 patients (mean age 70.2 years), 76 (37.1%) had LAS. The distribution of LAS was 29 extracranial ICA, 34 intracranial ICA/MCA (8 ICA only, 25 MCA only, 1 ICA+MCA) and 13 tandem stenosis (both extracranial ICA and intracranial ICA/MCA). Levels of CysC were higher in patients with extracranial ICA stenosis than in those with intracranial ICA/MCA stenosis (1.23 ± 0.33 vs. 0.97 ± 0.21 mg/l, p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, the highest CysC tertile (>1.04 mg/l) was significantly associated with extracranial ICA stenosis (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 5.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.51-16.63, p = 0.009) after adjustment for age, sex, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, current smoking, systolic blood pressure, HDL cholesterol, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and premorbid lipid-lowering drugs use. When CysC was considered as a continuous variable, 1 SD increase in CysC was significantly associated with extracranial ICA stenosis (adjusted OR 3.01, 95% CI 1.58-5.72, p = 0.001). However, there were no significant associations between CysC levels and intracranial ICA/MCA stenosis. In addition, CysC levels showed a weak but statistically significant correlation with hs-CRP levels (r = 0.195, p = 0.021). Using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, CysC value displayed good performance in discriminating extracranial ICA stenosis (c-statistic 0.79, 95% CI 0.69-0.89, p < 0.001).
