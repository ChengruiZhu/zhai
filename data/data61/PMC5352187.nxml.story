Pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1 (PTTG1) is identified as an oncogene, and overexpresses in many tumors. However, the role of PTTG1 in bladder cancer (BC) hasn't yet been characterized well. In this study, we showed the expression of PTTG1 mRNA and protein were both significantly increased in BC tissues and cells. The PTTG1 protein levels were positive correlated with increased tumor size, tumor–node–metastasis (TNM) stage, lymphatic invasion and distant metastasis of BC. PTTG1 knockdown dramatically suppressed the migration, invasion, metastasis and growth, and induced senescence and cell-cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase of BC cells. We further identified PTTG1 was the direct target of miR-146a-3p through using target prediction algorithms and luciferase reporter assay. miR-146a-3p was low expressed and negatively correlated with PTTG1 levels in BC tissues and cells. miR-146a-3p overexpression inhibited migration, invasion, metastasis and growth, and induced senescence of BC cells. Rescue experiment suggested ectopic expression of miR-146a-3p and PTTG1 suppressed migration, invasion and induced cell cycle arrest and senescence of BC cells compared to PTTG1 overexpression, confirming miR-146a-3p inhibited BC progression by targeting PTTG1. In summary, our study found miR-146a-3p/PTTG1 axis regulated BC migration, invasion, metastasis and growth, and might be a targets for BC therapy.
