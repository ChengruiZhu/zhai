Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured in vitro are a commonly used experimental system. When properly differentiated they acquire the so-called cobblestone phenotype; thereby mimicking an endothelium in vivo that can be used to shed light on multiple endothelial-related processes. In the present paper we report a simple, flexible, fast and reproducible method for an efficient isolation of viable HUVECs. The isolation is performed by sequential short trypsinization steps at room temperature. As umbilical cords are often damaged during labor, it is noteworthy that this new method can be applied even to short pieces of cord with success. In addition, we describe how to culture HUVECs as valid cobblestone cells in vitro on different types of extracellular matrix (basement membrane matrix, fibronectin and gelatin). We also show how to recognize mature cobblestone HUVECs by ordinary phase contrast microscopy. Our HUVEC model is validated as a system that retains important features inherent to the human umbilical vein endothelium in vivo. Phase contrast microscopy, immuno-fluorescence and electron microscopy reveal a tight cobblestone monolayer. Therein cells show Weibel-Palade bodies, caveolae and junctional complexes (comparable to the in vivo situation, as also shown in this study) and can internalize human low density lipoprotein. Isolation and culture of HUVECs as reported in this paper will result in an endothelium-mimicking experimental model convenient for multiple research goals.
