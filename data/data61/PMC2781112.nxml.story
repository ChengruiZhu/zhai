Apoptosis is one of the most investigated topics in the life sciences, especially as this kind of programmed cell death has been linked to several diseases. The strong desire to understand the function and regulation of apoptosis is unfortunately confronted with its complexity and its high degree of cross linking within the cell. Therefore we apply the so-called logical or Boolean mathematical modeling approach to comprehensively describe the numerous interactions in the apoptotic network. Classical Boolean modeling assumes that a certain cellular signal is either present (on) or absent (off). We use extensions of classical Boolean models, namely timescale constants and multi-value nodes, which allow the model to emulate typical apoptotic features. The mathematical model describes for the first time the numerous relevant interactions and signals that control apoptosis in a single and coherent framework. The logical model of apoptosis provides valuable information about the topology of the network including feedback loops and crosstalk effects. Proper investigation of the mutual interactions between species points towards hubs in the network with outstanding relevance. These species are of special interest concerning experimental intervention as well as drug target search. The model we present here is easy to use and freely available.
