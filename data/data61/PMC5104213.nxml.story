The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of paclitaxel combined with curcumin (CUR) against drug resistance in ovarian cancer cells. PLGA-phospholipid-PEG nanoparticles were prepared using the nano precipitation method. The size and morphology of the nanoparticles were determined using a transmission electron microscope and particle size analyzer. The encapsulation efficiency of nanoparticles was determined using the ultrafiltration centrifugation method. The dialysis method was used to study the release of PLGA-phospholipid-PEG nanoparticles. ADM was used to induce the A2780 cell line (human ovarian cancer cell line) to establish the model of the multidrug-resistant (MDR) cell line, and the protein activity of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in the A2780 cell line and A2780/ADM resistant cell line was determined using western blot analysis. The results showed that, the prepared nanoparticles were uniform in size, with a size of approximately 100 nm, and round in shape. Additionally, the nanoparticles had a more gentle and slow release than the free drug release. The results of the protein trace printing experiment showed that the P-gp content of the drug-resistant cell line was significantly reduced by the CUR nanoparticles. In conclusion, PLGA-phospholipid nanoparticles containing taxol and CUR have improved solubility and stability together with a slow release effect. In addition, CUR was able to overcome the MDR of tumor cells by elevating the paclitaxel concentration in the tumor cells to improve the antitumor activity of this combination.
