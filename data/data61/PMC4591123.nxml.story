Sleeping sickness, a disease that strikes predominantly poor populations in sub-Saharan Africa, has been targeted for elimination as a public health problem. Despite decades of control operations the disease remains enigmatic and is capable of persisting in populations at low levels of prevalence. Two mechanisms are investigated here that could allow persistence at such levels. Heterogeneous exposure of humans to tsetse is modelled as a subset of humans commuting to areas of high vectorial capacity. Additionally, non-human animals may act as reservoir species. We developed, parameterized, and investigated a model of sleeping sickness transmission to gain insight into the impact of these assumptions on the prospects of elimination using screening and treatment of humans and vector control. Supplemental use of vector control increased the probability of elimination and decreased the duration until elimination was achieved. This was more pronounced when animals did contribute to transmission, or when coverage and compliance of humans with screening operations was lower, for instance due to an inability to reach the humans at greatest risk of exposure. These results can provide insights to public health officials as to when to consider supplementing human treatment with additional measures, and thereby improve the prospects of elimination of this disease.
