The researchers purified lymphocytes (immune cells that are involved in antitumor responses) from the blood of patients with metastatic melanoma and healthy people and examined their patterns of gene expression using a technique called microarray expression profiling. CD8 T cells (which kill cells expressing foreign or altered antigens), CD4 T cells (which help other T and B lymphocytes do their jobs), and B cells (which make antibodies, proteins that recognize antigens and label cancer cells for destruction by the immune system) from patients with melanoma all expressed lower levels of 24 genes, and higher levels of one gene, than those from healthy individuals. 17 of these genes were interferon-stimulated genes, which encode proteins responsible for the effects of interferons. Therefore, the researchers checked the functional responses of patient and control lymphocytes to interferon. When interferon binds to lymphocytes, it triggers the addition of a phosphate group to the protein STAT1, which then induces changes in gene expression. STAT1 phosphorylation occurred in a lower percentage of patient lymphocytes than control lymphocytes in response to interferon-α (which is sometimes used to treat melanoma). The lymphocytes from one-third of the patients responded well to interferon-α, but those from the other patients showed little response. Furthermore, prolonged treatment with high concentrations of interferon-α partly overcame the defect in interferon signaling in patient lymphocytes. Finally, T cells from the patients failed to make the normal markers of immune cell activation or cytokines (proteins that mediate the killing of tumor cells) after exposure to activating stimuli and had reduced survival compared to control lymphocytes.
