Transcriptional profiling is arguably the most powerful hypothesis-free method for investigating biological effects of drugsâ€”so why do the experiments typically use outmoded single-dose designs? Such single-dose experiments will co-mingle effects that can occur with different potency (e.g., effects on the known target versus effects on additional undesired targets). Single-dose experiments have little comparability to the dose-response bioassays, which are now used throughout the drug discovery processes. One reason for the disparity between experimental approaches is that existing analytical methods for dose-response bioassays can't cope with the dimensionality of microarray data: a typical bioassay is optimized for one response, then used to run a screen against thousands of compounds; whereas transcriptional profiling measures thousands of non-optimized responses to a single compound. Conversely, existing methods for microarray data analysis can identify patterns, but provide no quantitative dose-response information. To overcome these problems, we developed novel algorithms and visualization methods that allow anyone to apply transcriptional profiling as a conventional dose-response assay. The approach provides far more information than limited-dose designs, yet is economical (12 arrays/compound). With this new analytical framework, it is now possible to identify distinct transcriptional responses at distinct regions of the dose range, to link these impacts to biological pathways, and to make realistic connections to drug targets and to other bioassays.
