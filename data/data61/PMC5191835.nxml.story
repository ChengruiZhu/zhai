The differentiation process has classically been seen as a stereotyped program leading from one progenitor toward a functional cell. This vision was based upon cell population-based analyses averaged over millions of cells. However, new methods have recently emerged that allow interrogation of the molecular content at the single-cell level, challenging this view with a new model suggesting that cell-to-cell gene expression stochasticity could play a key role in differentiation. We took advantage of a physiologically relevant avian cellular model to analyze the expression level of 92 genes in individual cells collected at several time-points during differentiation. We first observed that the process analyzed at the single-cell level is very different and much less well ordered than the population-based average view. Furthermore, we showed that cell-to-cell variability in gene expression peaks transiently before strongly decreasing. This rise in variability precedes two key events: an irreversible commitment to differentiation, followed by a significant increase in cell size variability. Altogether, our results support the idea that differentiation is not a “simple” series of well-ordered molecular events executed identically by all cells in a population but likely results from dynamical behavior of the underlying molecular network.
