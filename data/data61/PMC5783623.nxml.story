Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most fatal diseases and poses critical health problems worldwide. However, its mechanisms remain unclear. Consequently, there is an urgency to investigate the mechanisms involved in BC initiation and progression and identify novel therapeutics for its prevention and treatment. In this study, we identified karyopherin β-1 (Kpnβ1) as a possible novel therapeutic target for BC. Western blotting was used to evaluate the expression of Kpnβ1 in four pairs of tumorous and adjacent non-tumorous tissues. The results revealed that the protein level of Kpnβ1 was higher in the cancer samples compared with those in the corresponding normal samples. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 140 BC cases and indicated that Kpnβ1 was significantly associated with clinical pathological variables. Kaplan-Meier curve revealed that high expression of Kpnβ1 was related to poor BC patient prognosis. A starvation and re-feeding assay was used to imitate the cell cycle using the SKBR-3 cell line, indicating that Kpnβ1 plays a critical role in cell proliferation. The Cell Counting Kit-8 assay revealed that SKBR-3 cells treated with Kpnβ1-siRNA (siKpnβ1) grew more slowly than the control cells, while flow cytometry revealed that low-Kpnβ1 expressing SKBR-3 cells exhibited increased BC cell apoptosis. Furthermore, the interaction between Kpnβ1 and Her2 was clearly observed by immunoprecipitation, indicating that Kpnβ1-knockdown abrogated nuclear transport of Her2. In summary, our findings revealed that Kpnβ1 is involved in the progression of BC and may be a useful therapeutic target.
