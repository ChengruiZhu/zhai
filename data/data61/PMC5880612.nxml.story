High-risk HPV (hrHPV) is related to cervical carcinogenesis, although clinical data comparing the natural history and carcinogenic potential of type-specific HPV remain limited. Furthermore, the nationwide prevalence rates of overall and type-specific HPV among women with cervical precancerous lesions and cancer have not been reported. Here, a meta-analysis was performed for type-specific HPV distribution among 30,165 HPV-positive women, including 12,094 invasive cervical cancers (ICCs), 10,026 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2/3 (CIN2/3), 3246 CIN1, and 4799 normal cervices from 45 PCR-based studies. We found that HPV16 was the most common hrHPV type involved in cervical disease. The HPV16 positivity rate varied little across normal (22.7%) and CIN1 individuals (23.6%) but increased through the CIN2 (37.6%) and CIN3 patients (51.9%) to 65.6% in ICC cases. HPV16, 18, 35, 39, 45, and 59 were more frequent in ICC than CIN3, with ICC:CIN3 ratios ranging from 2.3 for HPV18 to 1.1 for HPV35/45. HPV31, 33, 52, and 58 were more frequent in CIN3 compared with normal cervices but less common in ICC compared with CIN3 (ICC:CIN3 ratios ranging from 0.6 for HPV58 and 0.4 for HPV52). The ICC:normal ratios were particularly high for HPV18, 52 and 58 in West China (4.1, 3.9 and 2.9, respectively) and for HPV45 and 59 in North China (1.6 and 1.1, respectively). In summary, this study is the most comprehensive analysis of type-specific HPV distribution in cervical carcinogenesis and could be valuable for HPV-based cervical cancer screening strategies and vaccination policies in China.
