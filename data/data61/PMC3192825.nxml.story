While researchers have identified candidate genes that have evolved under positive Darwinian natural selection, less is known about how much of the human genome has been affected by natural selection or whether positive selection has had a greater role at shaping patterns of variation across the human genome than negative selection acting against deleterious mutations. To address these questions, we have combined patterns of genetic variation in three genome-wide resequencing datasets with population genetic models of natural selection. We find that genetic diversity and average minor allele frequency are reduced in regions of the genome with low recombination rate. Additionally, genetic diversity, human-chimp divergence, and average minor allele frequency have been reduced near genes. Overall, while we cannot exclude positive selection at a fraction of mutations, models that include many weakly deleterious mutations throughout the human genome better explain multiple aspects of the genome-wide resequencing data. This work points to negative selection as an important force for shaping patterns of variation and suggests that there are many weakly deleterious mutations at both coding and noncoding sites throughout the human genome. Understanding such mutations will be important for learning about human evolution and the genetic basis of common disease.
