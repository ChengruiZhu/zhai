A 71-year-old man presented with a thymic mass involving the superior vena cava. A mediastinoscopical biopsy initially suggested a diagnosis of type A thymoma. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the patient underwent en-bloc thymectomy and vascular resection for a pathology-confirmed type B3 thymoma involving the superior vena cava, the left brachiocephalic vein and the distal part of the right brachiocephalic vein. Adjuvant radiotherapy was administered. Two years after the primary surgery, abdominal computed tomography (CT) and whole body fluorodeoxyglucose (18-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scans showed a single hepatic lesion that was treated with wedge liver resection. Pathological examination confirmed metastatic type B3 thymoma. Almost 4 years later, abdominal CT and 18-FDG PET revealed a 2.9-cm solid mass involving the body of the pancreas. Distal pancreatectomy with lymph node dissection was performed. Pathological examination showed a pancreatic metastasis from a type B3 thymoma, without lymph node involvement. The patient is alive and free of disease 6 months after the pancreatectomy (68 months after the initial thymectomy surgery). Intra-abdominal recurrence and pancreatic metastases are very uncommon manifestations of thymoma, but this event should be kept in mind when an abdominal mass is seen during follow-up.
