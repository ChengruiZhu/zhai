It is not uncommon to see in developing and underdeveloped countries, where the anesthesiologist who is untrained in cardiac specialty takes care of cardiac catheterization centers. The service in cardiac catheterization laboratories (CCL) in developed countries and some of the developing countries is mainly provided by the cardiac anesthesiologists. The scenario is not same in some part of developing countries or in underdeveloped countries which are mainly due to increase in number of CCL (catheterization laboratory) when compared to the number of cardiac anesthesiologists working outside the operation theater. It is also important for training the postgraduate in this field as to make them capable and competitive in managing such cases during emergency situation as it may save the life of a patient. Many a times, CCL is built as per the need of cardiologist ignoring the basic needs of cardiac anesthesiologist. It is important to note that anesthesiologist should be competent enough to provide complete, integrated anesthetic care outside the operation theater with available resources. It is challenging for the anesthesiologist to provide sedation or general anesthesia in such critical area where he/she will be dealing with life-threatening situations. In the modern era, the interventional techniques are advancing and treating complex heart diseases is more often. Days are not far where the CCL procedures may reduce the requirement of major surgeries. A careful and dedicated approach by the anesthesiologist with thorough knowledge and skills decreases morbidity and mortality rate. This article helps both cardiac and noncardiac anesthesiologists to improve their knowledge and to approach the patient systematically.
