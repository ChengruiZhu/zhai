The aim of the present study was to investigate the underlying mechanisms of methotrexate (MTX) resistance in the human osteosarcoma cell line, Saos-2/MTX4.4, and to evaluate various methods of overcoming the resistance to this chemotherapeutic agent. MMT assays were performed to determine the resistance of the primary (Saos-2) and resistant (Saos-2/MTX4.4) cell lines to MTX, cisplatin [cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II (DDP)], ifosfamide (IFO), Adriamycin (ADM), epirubicin (EPI) and theprubicin (THP). The Saos-2/MTX4.4 cells exhibited a low resistance to IFO, ADM, EPI and THP; however, no resistance to DDP was identified. Overall, the Saos-2/MTX4.4 cells exhibited a greater resistance to all the chemotherapeutic agents investigated compared with the Saos-2 cells. Rhodamine 123 (R123) fluorescence was measured in the Saos-2/MTX4.4 and Saos-2 cells 30 and 60 min after the addition of R123, and R123 plus verapamil (VER). VER administration increased the intracellular accumulation of R123. In addition, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine the mRNA expression levels of multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1) in the two cell lines. Although the Saos-2/MTX4.4 cells were more resistant to the chemotherapeutic agents than the Saos-2 cells, no significant difference was identified between the relative mRNA expression levels of MDR1 in the Saos-2/MTX4.4 and Saos-2 cells (0.4350±0.0354 vs. 0.3886±0.0456; P>0.05).
