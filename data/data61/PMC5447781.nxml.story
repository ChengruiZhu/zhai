The analysis of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) expression levels by immunohistochemistry is an important part of the initial evaluation of breast cancer and critically important in treatment planning. Anti-ERα (clone EP1) and anti-PR (clone PgR 1294) antibodies are in development for the Dako Omnis automated staining platform. These antibodies are not yet commercially available and are in performance evaluation, including the 4 international, multicenter studies reported here. For each antibody, a reproducibility study and a method comparison study was done in a randomized manner in order to test the antibodies under conditions closest to real-world user conditions. The reproducibility studies included 5 staining runs on the Dako Omnis with 20 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded human breast carcinoma specimens in 3 independent laboratories, and the method comparison studies included several hundred specimens stained on the Dako Omnis and on the Autostainer Link 48 platforms. Stained slides were evaluated for nuclear ER or PR expression according to American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists guidelines (≥1% cut-off for positive) by pathologists who were blinded from the staining method and specimen ID. For both anti-ERα (clone EP1) and anti-PR (clone PgR 1294) on the Dako Omnis, high reproducibility agreement rates were obtained on the interrun, interlaboratory, and interobserver endpoints. High concordance rates were observed between the specimens stained on the Dako Omnis platform and the Autostainer Link 48 platform. Staining quality was excellent for both anti-ERα (clone EP1) and anti-PR (clone PgR 1294) on the Dako Omnis. These results suggest that these antibodies are reliable and reproducible tools for immunohistochemistry analysis of ER and PR expression levels in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded breast carcinoma tissues on the Dako Omnis platform.
