We have studied the binding of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to attached cross-bridges in chemically skinned rabbit psoas muscle fibers and the effect of that binding on the cross-bridge detachment rate constants. Cross-bridges with ADP bound to the active site behave very similarly to cross-bridges without any nucleotide at the active site. First, fiber stiffness is the same as in rigor, which presumably implies that, as in rigor, all the cross-bridges are attached. Second, the cross- bridge detachment rate constants in the presence of ADP, measured from the rate of decay of the force induced by a small stretch, are, over a time scale of minutes, similar to those seen in rigor. Because ADP binding to the active site does not cause an increase in the cross- bridge detachment rate constants, whereas binding of nucleotide analogues such as adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) and pyrophosphate (PPi) do, it was possible, by using ADP as a competitive inhibitor of PPi or AMP-PNP, to measure the competitive inhibition constant and thereby the dissociation constant for ADP binding to attached cross-bridges. We found that adding 175 microM ADP to 4 mM PPi or 4 mM AMP-PNP produces as much of a decrease in the apparent cross- bridge detachment rate constants as reducing the analogue concentration from 4 to 1 mM. This suggests that ADP is binding to attached cross- bridges with a dissociation constant of approximately 60 microM. This value is quite similar to that reported for ADP binding to actomyosin subfragment-1 (acto-S1) in solution, which provides further support for the idea that nucleotides and nucleotide analogues seem to bind about as strongly to attached cross-bridges in fibers as to acto-S1 in solution (Johnson, R.E., and P.
