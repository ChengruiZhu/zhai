The construction of a conventional prostate needle (seeds) implant template restricts needles tilting or incline insertion when it is necessary to approach a seminal vesicle or to avoid the obstruction of symphysis pubis. To overcome the disadvantages of conventional templates, we developed a special template for guiding needles incline insertion and fixation for prostate needle implant. Phantom needles implantation was performed. Two acrylic boards, each 7.5 cm in width by 7.5 cm in length and 0.5 cm thickness, were drilled with a set of domed holes and cones with embedded template ball inside this combination to provide firm grip and fixation in prostate needle implantation. The specially designed domed‐cones combination acrylic board provides a needle of up to 60° rotation flexibility application. Some areas that could not be covered in a conventional parallel needle holes template could now be covered by using this new template. The covering index of prostate radiation dosage is up to 84.5%. The specially designed domed‐cones acrylic board combination provides not only a reliable means of needle fixation and rotational function, but also a superior dose distribution in the anterior portion of the prostate and good coverage of a seminal vesicle. This special template is a feasible design for prostate needles or seeds implant brachytherapy.
