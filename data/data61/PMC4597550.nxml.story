Overall, 67/221 (30.3%) patients who underwent ACLR stated that they had no numbness at 6 weeks. Of those patients who reported numbness at 6 weeks, 16.6% (25/151) considered their numbness completely resolved by six months. At 1 year, 73.2% (90/123) reported their numbness had gotten better and 14.2% (18/123) considered their numbness resolved. The most common location of numbness was along the inferolateral aspect of the knee. The mean numbness rating for allografts was 2.73 +/- 0.32 (mean +/- standard error) at 6 weeks, decreasing to 1.04 +/- 0.26 at 6 months and 0.64 +/- 0.26 at 1 year for oblique and vertical incisions combined. A statistical model, controlling for time and incision direction, indicated that HS patients were 1.94 +/- 0.52 points higher than allograft patients across all time points, and BTB patients were 1.57 +/- 0.51 points higher than allo. However, there were no significant difference in mean numbness score between BTB and HS patients (p=0.521). Time had a negative impact on the patient reported severity of numbness score for all graft types. At 6 months this effect was -0.95 +/- 0.17 and at 1 year, -1.21 +/- 0.18. The use of BTB increased the mean numbness of affected segments by 0.67 +/- 0.23, while the use of a HS increased the mean numbness of segments by 0.39 +/- 0.21. The mean number of segments decreased slightly with time, down by 0.20 +/- 0.08 at 6 months (p=0.008) and 0.28+- 0.08 at 1 year (p=<0.001).
