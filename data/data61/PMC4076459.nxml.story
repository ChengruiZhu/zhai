Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) is an acute cardiac syndrome characterized by extensive, but potentially reversible, left ventricular dysfunction in the absence of an explanatory coronary obstruction. Thus, TCM is distinct from coronary artery disease (CAD) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, substantial evidence for co-existing CAD in some TCM patients exist. Herein, we take this association one step further and present a case in which the patient simultaneously suffered from AMI and TCM, and in which we believe that a primary coronary event triggered TCM. An 88-year-old female presented with chest pain. Echocardiography revealed apical akinesia with hypercontractile bases. An occluded diagonal branch with suspected acute plaque rupture was identified on the angiogram, but could not explain the extent of akinesia. Cardiac function recovered completely. Thus, this patient adhered to current diagnostic criteria for TCM. TCM is a well-known complication for other conditions associated with somatic stress. It is therefore intuitive to assume that AMI, which also associates with somatic stress and elevated catecholamine, can cause TCM. Our case illustrates that TCM and AMI may occur simultaneously. Although causality cannot be conclusively inferred from this association, the somatic stress associated with AMI may have caused TCM in this patient.
