The objective of these experiments was to test the hypothesis that the "creep currents" induced by Na loading of single frog atrial cells (Hume, J. R., and A. Uehara. 1986. Journal of General Physiology. 87:833) may be generated by an electrogenic Na/Ca exchanger. Creep currents induced by Na loading were examined over a wide range of membrane potentials. During depolarizing voltage-clamp pulses, outward creep currents were observed, followed by inward creep currents upon the return to the holding potential. During hyperpolarizing voltage- clamp pulses, creep currents of the opposite polarity were observed: inward creep currents were observed during the pulses, followed by outward creep currents upon the return to the holding potential. The current-voltage relations for inward and outward creep currents in response to depolarizing or hyperpolarizing voltage displacements away from the holding potential all intersect the voltage axis at a common potential, which indicates that inward and outward creep currents may have a common reversal potential under equilibrium conditions and may therefore be generated by a common mechanism. Measurements of inward creep currents confirm that voltage displacements away from the holding potential rapidly alter equilibrium conditions. Current-voltage relationships of inward creep currents after depolarizing voltage-clamp pulses are extremely labile and depend critically upon the amplitude and duration of outward creep currents elicited during preceding voltage-clamp pulses. An optical monitor of mechanical activity in single cells revealed (a) a similar voltage dependence for the outward creep currents induced by Na loading and tonic contraction, and (b) a close correlation between the time course of the decay of the inward creep current and the time course of mechanical relaxation. A mathematical model of electrogenic Na/Ca exchange (Mullins, L.J. 1979. Federation Proceedings. 35:2583; Noble, D. 1986. Cardiac Muscle. 171- 200) can adequately account for many of the properties of creep currents. It is concluded that creep currents in single frog atrial cells may be attributed to the operation of an electrogenic Na/Ca exchange mechanism.
