A total of 44 patients was managed for PUV within the period. The mean age of presentation was 3.95 years with 56.8% of the patients presenting after the age of 1 year. Voiding dysfunction noted in 40 (91.0%) patients was the most common mode of presentation. The most common finding on physical examination was a palpable bladder while urinary tract infection noted in 23 (52.3%) patients was the most common complication noted. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed dilated posterior urethra in 16 (36.4%) cases, while micturating cystourethrogram revealed a dilated proximal urethra in all 35 cases in which it was done, diverticulum in 6 and vesicoureteric reflux in 9. The creatinine value at presentation ranged between 0.4 mg/dl and 4.0 mg/dl with a mean of 1.02 Â± 0.93 mg/dl. Urethroscopy in 37 patients confirmed type I and type III PUV in 35 and 2 patients, respectively. Valve ablation with a diathermy bugbee electrode provided relief of obstructions in the 37 patients who underwent the procedure without any significant immediate complication. The period of follow-up ranged between 2 weeks and 3 years with a mean of 10.2 months. There was sustained improvement in urine stream, reduction in the mean creatinine concentration and incidence of UTI during follow-up. However, patients with significantly impaired renal function had a poorer outcome.
