The objective of this study is to investigate the prevalence of missing teeth and prosthodontic replacements in a Chinese adult population using a hierarchical dental functional classification system. A total of 1,462 dentate subjects over 40 years from Shandong Province, China were included and categorized in the functional classification system with and without tooth replacements. Depending on replacements, subjects could be reclassified (promoted) to categories reflecting higher functionality. “Promotions” were considered indicators for prosthodontic effectiveness. Homogeneities after dichotomization into functional categories appeared to be moderate to good. In the “≥10 teeth in each jaw” branch, mean number of teeth and posterior occluding pairs were 27.93 ± 2.74 and 7.10 ± 1.94, respectively. In the branch “<10 teeth in each jaw,” these figures were 16.17 ± 5.54 and 1.49 ± 1.45. Fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) added on average 3.5 artificial teeth; 46% of subjects with FDP promoted to a higher functional level. For removable dental prostheses (RDPs), these numbers were 8.5% and 79%, respectively. Promotion value per tooth added was significantly higher for FDPs. The classification system was able to quantify the effectiveness of teeth replacements. It was shown that RDPs were more effective when higher numbers of teeth were replaced, while FDPs were more effective per artificial tooth added.
