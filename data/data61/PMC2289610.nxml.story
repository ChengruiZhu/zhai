The lymphocyte-specific phosphoprotein LSP1 associates with the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane and with the cytoskeleton. Mouse LSP1 protein contains 330 amino acids and contains an NH2- terminal acidic domain of approximately 177 amino acids. The COOH- terminal half of the LSP1 protein is rich in basic residues. In this paper we show that LSP1 protein which is immunoprecipitated with anti- LSP1 antibodies from NP-40-soluble lysates of the mouse B-lymphoma cell line BAL17 is associated with actin. In vitro binding experiments using recombinant LSP1 (rLSP1) protein and rabbit skeletal muscle actin show that LSP1 binds along the sides of F-actin but does not bind to G- actin. rLSP1 does not alter the initial polymerization kinetics of actin. The highly conserved COOH-terminal basic domains of mouse and human LSP1 share a significant homology with the 20-kD COOH-terminal F- actin binding fragment of caldesmon. A truncated rLSP1 protein containing the entire COOH-terminal basic domain from residue 179 to 330, but not the NH2-terminal acidic domain binds to F-actin at least as well as rLSP1. When LSP1/CAT fusion proteins are expressed in a LSP1- negative T-lymphoma cell line, only fusion proteins containing the basic COOH-terminal domain associate with the NP-40-insoluble cytoskeleton. These data show that LSP1 binds F-actin through its COOH- terminal basic domain and strongly suggest that LSP1 interacts with the cytoskeleton by direct binding to F-actin. We propose that LSP1 plays a role in mediating cytoskeleton driven responses in lymphocytes such as receptor capping, cell motility, or cell-cell interactions.
