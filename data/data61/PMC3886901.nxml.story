An important goal in evolutionary genetics is to understand how genetic mutations cause the evolution of new protein functions and how a protein's structure shapes its evolution. Here we address these questions by studying a dramatic lineage-specific shift in function in steroid hormone receptors (SRs), a physiologically important family of transcription factors. In vertebrates, SRs bind hormones and then undergo a structural change that allows them to activate gene expression. In mollusks, SRs do not bind hormone and are always active. We identified the genetic and structural mechanisms for the evolution of constitutive activity in the mollusk SRs by using X-ray crystallography, ancestral sequence reconstruction, and experimental studies of the effects of ancient mutations on protein structure and function. We found that constitutive activity evolved due to just two historical substitutions that subtly stabilized elements of the active conformation, and subsequent mutations filled the hormone-binding cavity. The structural characteristics required for a hormone-sensitive activator were thus vestigialized, much the same way that a whale's hindlimbs became vestiges of their ancestral form after they became dispensable. Our findings show how the architecture of a protein can shape its evolution, allowing radically different functions to evolve by a few large-effect mutations.
