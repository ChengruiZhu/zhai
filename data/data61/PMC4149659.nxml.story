HIV/AIDS vaccines and also PrEP are considered as the most perspective approaches to control HIV/AIDS epidemic. Candidate conjugated polymer-subunit HIV vaccine VICHREPOL, developed in Moscow Institute of Immunology, successfully passed phase I clinical trials and now is at the start of phase II trials. Two other candidate vaccines (DNA-based and viral vector-based) are also passed phase I trials. Positive effect of vaccination depends of the coverage of population and this coverage depends of vaccine uptake. Estimation of possible uptake of HIV vaccine is very important to provide its further effective application. Pilot investigation of readiness for HIV vaccination in Russia (Moscow region) was performed [416 persons, 254 (61%)—men, 162 (39%)—women, age of 16–55]. Sixty percent of respondents were ready for HIV vaccination. Seventy nine percent of respondents with risk of HIV infection, agreed to be vaccinated vs 48% of those disclaimed the risk of HIV infection. Readiness for HIV vaccination is 20% lower in respondents with children vs childless. In case of 30% vaccine efficacy readiness for vaccination was 3.5 points of 10; in case of 50% efficacy—5.2 points of 10; 8.8 points of 10—in case of 90%–95% efficacy. Readiness for vaccination also depends from its duration, number of doses in course, possible adverse side effects, mode of vaccination. Twenty percent of respondents agreed only for free vaccination, 45%—for paid vaccination. Readiness for HIV vaccination is lower in general population (60% vs 78%) and in HIV infection risk groups (79% vs 95%–97%) in Russia vs some other countries (Suraratdecha et al., 2005). It is necessary to improve education programs aimed to inform on HIV vaccines development, its safety and application.
