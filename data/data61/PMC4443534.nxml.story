Twenty-seven patients (22 boys, 5 girls) had a neonatal presentation; 52 patients had an “intermediate” late-onset form of the disease (21 boys, 31 girls) that was revealed between 1 month and 16 years; and 11 patients (5 boys, 6 girls) presented in adulthood (16 to 55 years). Patients with a neonatal presentation had increased mortality (90% versus 13% in late-onset forms) and peak plasma ammonium (mean value: 960 μmol/L versus 500 μmol/L) and glutamine (mean value: 4110 μmol/L versus 1000 μmol/L) levels at diagnosis. All of the neonatal forms displayed a greater number of acute decompensations (mean value: 6.2/patient versus 2.5 and 1.4 in infants and adults, respectively). In the adult group, some patients even recently died at the time of presentation during their first episode of coma. Molecular analyses identified a deleterious mutation in 59/68 patients investigated. Single base substitutions were detected more frequently than deletions (69% and 12%, respectively), with a recurrent mutation identified in the late-onset groups (pArg40 His; 13% in infants, 57% in adults); inherited mutations represented half of the cases. The neurological score did not differ significantly between the patients who were alive in the neonatal or late-onset groups and did not correlate with the peak ammonia and plasma glutamine concentrations at diagnosis. However, in late-onset forms of the disease, ammonia levels adjusted according to the glutamine/citrulline ratio at diagnosis were borderline predictors of low IQ (p = 0.12 by logistic regression; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 76%, p <0.05).
