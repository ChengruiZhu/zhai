As an important chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of osteosarcoma, the effectiveness of cisplatin is considered to be due to its unique properties, which allow it to penetrate the cell membrane and form various DNA-platinum adducts, resulting in genetic alterations or DNA damage. However, chemoresistance to cisplatin remains a major challenge for its use and chemotherapeutic effects. In the present study, an isogenic model of a cisplatin resistant osteosarcoma cell line, MG63-DDP, was generated from the original MG63 cell line. The expression level of microRNA (miR)-133b in the MG63-DDP cisplatin-resistant osteosarcoma cell line was analyzed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cisplatin-DNA adduct formation, cell death (carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester/propidium iodide staining) and clonogenic survival assays (crystal violet staining) were performed, comparing various cell types. The effect of miR-133b on migration (scratch wound assay) and invasion (Transwell assay) was also evaluated. Characterization studies have previously revealed an increased level of miR-133b in MG63-DDP cells compared with normal MG63 cells. Upregulation of miR-133b was associated with the accumulation of cisplatin-DNA adducts and an increase in cisplatin-induced cell death. Furthermore, increased miR-133b expression levels enhanced the migration and invasion of MG63 cells under cisplatin stress. Concordantly, in MG63-DDP cells the neutralization of miR-133b demonstrated opposite effects, as compared with the upregulation of miR-133b. To the best of our knowledge, the present study demonstrated for the first time that cisplatin-resistant MG63 cells exhibit an increased level of miR-133b expression. The endogenous expression level of miR-133b is sufficient for inducing cisplatin resistance, which suggests that miR-133b may be a biomarker for cisplatin resistance in osteosarcoma.
