This study deals with the effect of mucosal UO2(2+) on the Ca(2+)- blockable, poorly selective cation channels in the apical membrane of frog skin and toad urinary bladder. Our data show that UO2(2+) inhibits the Na+ currents through the amiloride-insensitive cation pathway and confirm a previously described stimulatory effect on the amiloride- blockade Na+ transport. Noise analysis of the Ca(2+)-blockable current demonstrates that the divalent also depresses the low-frequency Lorentzian (fc = 11.7 Hz) in the power density spectrum (PDS) and reveals the presence of high-frequency relaxation noise (fc = 58.5 Hz). The action of UO2(2+) is not reversed upon washout and is not accompanied by noise, typically induced by reversible blockers. The divalent merely depresses the plateau of the low-frequency Lorentzian, demonstrating a decrease in the number of conductive cation channels. Similarly, with mucosal K+ and Rb+, UO2(2+) also unmasks the high- frequency Lorentzian by depressing the noise from the slowly fluctuating cation channels (type S). In all experiments with mucosal Cs+, the PDS contains high-frequency relaxation noise (fc = 75.1 Hz in Rana temporaria, and 65.4 Hz in Rana ridibunda). An effect of UO2(2+) on the Cs+ currents and Lorentzian plateaus could not be demonstrated, suggesting that this monovalent cation does not pass through type S channels. Experiments with the urinary bladder revealed only a UO2(2+)- insensitive pathway permeable for Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+. We submit that in frog skin two cation-selective channels occur, distinguished by their spontaneous gating kinetics, their sensitivity to UO2(2+), and their permeability for Cs+. In toad urinary bladder, only one kind of cation-selective channel is observed, which resembles the UO2(2+)- insensitive channel in frog skin, with fast open-closed kinetics (type F).
