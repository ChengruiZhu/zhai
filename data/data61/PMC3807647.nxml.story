Spatial variation of the haemodynamic stresses acting on the arterial wall is commonly assumed to explain the focal development of atherosclerosis. Disturbed flow in particular is thought to play a key role. However, widely-used metrics developed to quantify its extent are unable to distinguish between uniaxial and multidirectional flows. We analysed pulsatile flow fields obtained in idealised and anatomically-realistic arterial geometries using computational fluid dynamics techniques, and in particular investigated the multidirectionality of the flow fields, capturing this aspect of near-wall blood flow with a new metric – the transverse wall shear stress (transWSS) – calculated as the time-average of wall shear stress components perpendicular to the mean flow direction. In the idealised branching geometry, multidirectional flow was observed downstream of the branch ostium, a region of flow stagnation, and to the sides of the ostium. The distribution of the transWSS was different from the pattern of traditional haemodynamic metrics and more dependent on the velocity waveform imposed at the branch outlet. In rabbit aortas, transWSS patterns were again different from patterns of traditional metrics. The near-branch pattern varied between intercostal ostia, as is the case for lesion distribution; for some branches there were striking resemblances to the age-dependent patterns of disease seen in rabbit and human aortas. The new metric may lead to improved understanding of atherogenesis.
