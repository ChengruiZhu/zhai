Recent work has attempted to use whole-genome sequence data from pathogens to reconstruct the transmission trees linking infectors and infectees in outbreaks. However, transmission trees from one outbreak do not generalize to future outbreaks. Reconstruction of transmission trees is most useful to public health if it leads to generalizable scientific insights about disease transmission. Accurate estimates of transmission parameters can help identify risk factors for transmission and aid the design and evaluation of public health interventions for emerging infections. Using statistical methods for time-to-event data (survival analysis), estimation of transmission parameters is based on sums or averages over the possible transmission trees. By providing partial information about who infected whom, a pathogen phylogeny can reduce the set of possible transmission trees and increase the precision of transmission parameter estimates. We derive algorithms that enumerate the transmission trees consistent with a pathogen phylogeny and epidemiologic data, show how to calculate likelihoods for transmission data with a phylogeny, and apply these methods to a foot and mouth disease outbreak in the United Kingdom in 2001. These methods will allow pathogen genetic sequences to be incorporated into the analysis of outbreak investigations, vaccine trials, and other studies of infectious disease transmission.
