The predictions of biomolecular functions and properties from biomolecular structures are of fundamental importance in computational biophysics. The structural and biological complexities of biomolecules and their interactions hinder successful predictions. Machine learning has become an important tool for such predictions. Recent advances in deep learning architectures, particularly convolutional neural network (CNN), have profoundly impacted a number of disciplines, such as image classification and voice recognition. Though CNN can be directly applied to molecular sciences by using a three-dimensional (3D) image-like brute-force representation, it is computationally intractable when applied to large biomolecules and large datasets. We propose a topological strategy to significantly reduce the structural and biological complexity of biomolecules and provide an efficient topology based CNN architecture. Element-specific persistent homology, a new algebraic topology, has been developed to cast biomolecules in a multichannel image-like representation suitable for CNN. The power of the proposed topology based neural network (TopologyNet) is further enhanced by auxiliary descriptors and a multi-task deep learning architecture. It has been demonstrated that TopologyNet framework outperforms other methods in the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation induced protein stability changes.
