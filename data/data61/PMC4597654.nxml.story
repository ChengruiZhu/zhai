According to Schenck’s classification, 6 knee joints (13.9%) were classified as KDI, 3 joints (6.9%) as KDII, 10 joints (23.2%) as KDIII, 19 joints (44.1%) as KDIV and 3 (6.9%) as KDV. An arterial injury was diagnosed in 11 cases (25.5%), fibular nerve injury in 12 cases (27.9%) and tibial nerve injury in 2 cases (4.6%). An external fixator was placed in 20 patients (46.5%) in the emergency setting. Vascular repair was performed in 6 patients, of which four (9.3%) also received a fasciatomy with a diagnosis of compartment syndrome. Fibular nerve was repaired in 9 joints. ACL reconstruction was performed in 22 joints, PCL in 10, MCL repair in 26, LCL repair or reconstruction in 35 and PLC repair or reconstruction in 10. In the final follow-up examination, mean ROM was calculated as 116 degrees, mean KSS-1 score as 79, mean KSS-2 score as 78; mean Tegner-Lysholm score as 80, mean IKDC score as 72, mean SF-36 MCS as 50 and mean SF-36 PCS as 48. Both arterial and fibular nerve injuries were associated with a poor outcome using the IKDC, KSS 1-2 and Tegner-Lysholm scores (p<0.01). A vascular injury was related to a significantly lower ROM degree (p<0.05) in the final follow-up, as well as the fibular nerve damage (p<0.05). The severity of knee injury (Schenck’s grade) was inversely correlated with ROM degrees (P<0.05). SF-36 life quality scores were significantly better in KDI group when compared to the remaining four groups (p=0.02), while no difference was observed between groups KDII - KDV. Incidence of neurovascular damage was not increased with the severity of the Schenck’s grade.
