The present report aimed to study genetic alterations underlying extraovarian peritoneal serous papillary carcinoma (EPSPC), which have not previously been systematically investigated. A case of EPSPC was identified, and its genetic alterations were assessed by combining comparative genomic hybridization and whole-exome sequencing technologies to investigate the genomic landscape, including copy number variations and mutations in EPSPC. It was found that a large number of germline mutations were present, which may have predisposed the patient to the occurrence of this disease. Copy number gains were found in a range of chromosomes, including 4q, 5q, 8q, 10q, 15q, 16p, 18q, 20p, 20q and Xq. Large-scale copy number loss occurred in chromosomes 2p, 13q, 16q, 17p and 17q. Through use of whole-exome sequencing, germline mutations were widely found that were associated with cancer development, including mutations in the BRCA1, DNA repair associated (BRCA1), BRCA2, tumor protein 53, erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2, matrix metalloproteinases and ADAM metallopeptidase domain-containing genes. In addition, 165 somatic mutations, including 52 missense mutations and 7 short insertions or deletions, were also identified. In summary, the EPSPC was undergoing profound genomic rearrangement and somatic mutation, which may have led to its initiation and development, and the present study discussed the genetic basis of this highly malignant cancer.
