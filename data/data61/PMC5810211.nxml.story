S groups. After 8 weeks, the pathological morphological changes in myocardial fibers were observed following hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome staining. Apoptosis of myocardial tissue was analyzed by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay. Oxidative stress was evaluated through detecting the content of malondialdehyde (MDA), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the myocardial cells by ELISA. The expression of collagen III, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)8, MMP14, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)2, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE), eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), GRP94, Bcl-2, caspase-3, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and proteins related to the JAK/STAT pathway, was detected by western blot analysis. The results indicated that the array of myocardial cells was markedly disordered in STZ group rats; compared with the control group, both myocardial interstitial fibrosis and the deposition of collagen III were increased. Furthermore, the expression ratio of MMPs/TIMPs was dysregulated, while the expression levels of TGF-β, eIF2α, GRP94, caspase-3, TNF-α, NF-κB, MDA and 4-HNE were significantly increased. Furthermore, the expressions of JAK-1/2 and STAT1/3/5/6 were also markedly upregulated, while those of CSE, SOD, GSH and Bcl-2 were downregulated. Compared with the STZ group, these changes were reversed in the STZ + H
