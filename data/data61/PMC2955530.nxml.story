Automatic detection and characterization of molecular behavior in large data sets obtained by fast imaging in advanced light microscopy become key issues to decipher the dynamic architectures and their coordination in the living cell. Automatic quantification of the number of sudden and transient events observed in fluorescence microscopy is discussed in this paper. We propose a calibrated method based on the comparison of image patches expected to distinguish sudden appearing/vanishing fluorescent spots from other motion behaviors such as lateral movements. We analyze the performances of two statistical control procedures and compare the proposed approach to a frame difference approach using the same controls on a benchmark of synthetic image sequences. We have then selected a molecular model related to membrane trafficking and considered real image sequences obtained in cells stably expressing an endocytic-recycling trans-membrane protein, the Langerin-YFP, for validation. With this model, we targeted the efficient detection of fast and transient local fluorescence concentration arising in image sequences from a data base provided by two different microscopy modalities, wide field (WF) video microscopy using maximum intensity projection along the axial direction and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Finally, the proposed detection method is briefly used to statistically explore the effect of several perturbations on the rate of transient events detected on the pilot biological model.
