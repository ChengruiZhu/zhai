While at present most biotechnology industrial facilities adopt batch or fed-batch processes, continuous processing has been vigorously defended in the literature and many predict its adoption in the near future. However, identical cultures may lead to distinct steady states and the lack of comprehension of this multiplicity has been a limiting factor for the widespread application of this kind of processes in the industry. In this work we try to remediate this providing a computationally tractable approach to determine the steady-states of genome-scale metabolic networks in continous cell cultures and show the existence of general invariance laws across different cultures. We represent a continuous cell culture as a metabolic model of a cell coupled to a dynamic environment that includes toxic by-products of metabolism and the cell capacity to grow. We show that the ratio between cell density and dilution rate is the control parameter fixing steady states with desired properties, and that this is invariant accross perfusion systems. The typical multi-stability of the steady-states of this kind of culture is explained by the negative feedback loop on cell growth due to toxic byproduct accumulation. Moreover, we present invariance laws connecting continuous cell cultures with different parameters that imply that the chemostat is the ideal experimental model to faithfully reproduce the complex landscape of metabolic transitions of a perfusion system.
