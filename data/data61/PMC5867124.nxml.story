Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells have become the most widely utilized mammalian cell line for the production of recombinant proteins. However, the product yield and transgene instability need to be further increased and solved. In this study, we investigated the effect of five different introns on transgene expression in CHO cells. hCMV intron A, adenovirus tripartite leader sequence intron, SV40 intron, Chinese hamster EF‐1alpha gene intron 1 and intervening sequence intron were cloned downstream of the eGFP expression cassette in a eukaryotic vector, which was then transfected into CHO cells. qRT‐PCR and flow cytometry were used to explore eGFP expression levels. And gene copy number was also detected by qPCR, respectively. Furthermore, the erythropoietin (EPO) protein was used to test the selected more strong intron. The results showed that SV40 intron exhibited the highest transgene expression level among the five compared intron elements under transient and stable transfections. In addition, the SV40 intron element can increase the ratio of positive colonies and decrease the coefficient of variation in transgene expression level. Moreover, the transgene expression level was not related to the gene copy number in stable transfected CHO cells. Also, the SV40 intron induced higher level of EPO expression than IVS intron in transfected CHO cell. In conclusion, SV40 intron is a potent strong intron element that increases transgene expression, which can readily be used to more efficient transgenic protein production in CHO cells.
