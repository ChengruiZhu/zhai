In 80 skeletally mature Sprague Dawley rats 5 milligram/kg body weight of SHMSP was injected intramuscularly. Blood samples were collected at 0, 30, 60, 120, 240, 320 minutes and 480 minutes. The plasma calibration curves were prepared at concentrations of 6.25, 3.12, 1.56, 0.78 and 0.39 ng/mL by spiking 190 µL of rat plasma with 10µL of working standard and 200 µL of deionized water. Samples were vortexed for five seconds, centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4°C and the supernatant was collected analyzed using High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). After injection of 20 µL sample, the peptide was eluted with 15ml linear gradient up to 36% of eluent A. The time between injections was 25 min. and the eluent was monitored at a wavelength of 215 nm. The concentration of peptide present in the rat plasma samples collected at different time intervals were quantified using standard curve method. The goats were injected deep intramuscularly 100 mg/kg-body weight of the SHMSP dissolved in injection solution. In 10 Sprague Dawley rats of ≥250 grams of weight, 20 mg/kg/day SHMSP was injected for 7 consecutive days. All the animals were kept at a close watch. Clinical observation at least once daily and as necessary was undertaken. After 2 weeks animals were euthanized and major organs were harvested and histopathology samples were obtained and processed.
