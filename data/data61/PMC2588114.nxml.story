In their natural cellular environment proteins are dissolved in a concentrated aqueous solution of biomolecules. Even under such crowded conditions, proteins must not clump together or aggregate; otherwise their biological functions may be compromised, and the cell could die. Diseases such as Parkinson and Alzheimer are thought to be caused by aggregation of specific proteins. Evolutionary pressure generally ensures that proteins do not aggregate in their natural biochemical environment. A well-known mechanism to prevent aggregation is the folding of proteins, where the hydrophobic (attractive) part of the protein is buried inside the protein. Here we report a different mechanism that can prevent the aggregation of proteins. Recently, it was discovered that many proteins contain regions that are disordered (not folded) in their natural environment. We show with coarse-grained simulations that aggregation of small hydrophobic binding motifs can be prevented by embedding the motifs in disordered regions: the disordered regions of different proteins obstruct or sterically hinder the formation of aggregates. Moreover, our simulations show that the disordered regions have no adverse effect on the biological function of the binding motifs, because they do not obstruct the binding and folding of the binding motif on its specific substrate.
