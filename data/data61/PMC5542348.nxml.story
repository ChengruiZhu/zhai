Biological therapies such as autologous chondrocyte implantation which use serially passaged chondrocytes to repair cartilage defects, are often unsuccessful as they lead to the formation of fibrocartilage. Fibrocartilage is rich in collagen type 1 (Col1) and lacks the structural complexity, low friction, and load distribution properties of articular cartilage. Fibrocartilage forms as a result of the phenotype of passaged chondrocytes. When serially passaged in monolayer to increase cell numbers, chondrocytes lose their phenotype in a process termed “dedifferentiation”. This is characterized by a loss in the production of collagen type II (Col2) and aggrecan (Acan), the major extracellular matrix molecules of articular cartilage, and an increase in the production of Col1. Therefore, to increase the success of therapies which use passaged chondrocytes, these cells must be redifferentiated to re-establish an articular cartilage phenotype prior to implantation in a cartilage lesion. Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signalling is known to play important roles in both cell differentiation and articular cartilage repair. However, intra-articular injections with TGFβ have been shown to result in osteophyte formation and fibrosis of synovial tissues. Therefore, redifferentiating passaged chondrocytes in vitro using TGFβ prior to their use in vivo may be a better alternative. Fibrin glue is commonly used in orthopaedics to maintain cells in a cartilage lesion, however the effects of fibrin glue on chondrocytes have not been fully investigated. Thus we hypothesize that passaged chondrocytes redifferentiated in vitro with TGFβ will maintain their phenotype and form articular cartilage-like tissue when embedded in fibrin glue in the absence of further exogenous supplementation with TGFβ in vitro.
