Meiosis enables sexual reproduction in eukaryotes by producing gametes. In the process, it increases genetic diversity through recombination of homologous chromosomes from the parents. Genetic diversity constitutes an evolutionary advantage. Prior to finding their unique pairing partner (homolog), chromosomes associate non-homologously with other chromosomes through their centromeres, a process termed centromere coupling. Little is known about the nature and mechanism of centromere coupling. In this study, we present the first pairwise characterization of this process conserved amongst eukaryotes, using the budding yeast as a model. We quantitatively analyzed the interactions between centromeres for each pair of chromosomes. We observed an interaction pattern based on chromosome size, where centromeres from smaller chromosomes frequently associated with those from other small chromosomes, and a similar association for large chromosomes. This pattern appears ubiquitous, since recombination-defective diploid cells, haploid cells forced to undergo meiosis, and wild-type yeast early in meiosis, until homologous chromosomes become paired, all undergo non-homologous centromere coupling. Centromeres derived from a common ancestor, prior to genome duplication, do not associate more often, excluding ancestral homology as the mechanism. Data from mutants affecting the meiotic bouquet, where all chromosome ends become embedded and clustered in the nuclear envelope prior to coupling, suggest a potential mechanism to generate interactions. Deciphering the mechanisms for proper pairing of homologous chromosomes helps us to understand and prevent chromosomal abnormalities in pregnancy.
