The functions of most proteins are defined by their interactions with other biological substances, such as DNA, nutrients, hormones, or other proteins. Some proteins are highly specific, but others are more promiscuous and can interact with a variety of natural substances, as well as drugs and pollutants. Understanding molecular interactions is a key goal in pharmacology and toxicology, but there are few general principles to help explain or predict protein specificity. Because every biological entity is the result of evolution, understanding a protein's history might help explain why it interacts with the substances to which it is sensitive. In this paper, we used ancestral protein reconstruction to experimentally trace how specificity evolved in an ancient group of proteins, the steroid hormone receptors (SRs), a family of proteins that regulate reproduction and other biological processes in animals. We show that SRs evolved according to a principle of minimal specificity: at each point in time, these proteins evolved to be specific enough to distinguish among the substances to which they were naturally exposed, but not more so. Our findings provide an historical explanation for modern SRs' diverse sensitivities to natural and man-made substances; they show that knowledge of history can contribute to predicting the ligands to which a modern protein will respond and indicate that promiscuity reflects the limited power of natural selection to discriminate between perfect and “good enough.”
