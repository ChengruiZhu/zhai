Girdlestone wrote at least two articles describing excision arthroplasty of the hip. The first, from 1928, described a radical excision for draining tuberculous hips [1] and the second (reprinted here), from 1942, a related and perhaps at times even more radical operation for pyogenic infections [2]. Girdlestone emphasized these radical operations were intended only for severe infections, and readers are reminded these were both published in the preantibiotic era, when radical surgery was often required to save a patient’s life. In the first article, he also emphasized the principle of “removal of diseased and devitalized tissues, flattening down of dead spaces, and leaving drainage so complete and lasting as will allow the wound to heal from the bottom” [1]. He excised the greater trochanter and all involved muscles, suturing skin edges deep into the wound so as to achieve effective drainage. When necessary, he also “flattened” the edges of the acetabulum. In the second article he suggested less radical operations were often ineffective in pyogenic infections owing to the “miniature rabbit-warren of sinuses and cavities” [2]. The techniques were fundamentally similar to those he had earlier described for tuberculosis. He used a wide transverse incision (Fig. 2) to access the hip, excising all lateral musculature along with the trochanter and the lateral margin of the acetabulum (Fig. 1). In the presence of infection in the intermuscular planes, he avoided suturing the skin deeply, and rather packed the wound with Vaseline gauze and rubber drains (Fig. 4). The postoperative care included splinting either on a frame (if good nursing care was available) or spica casting with a large window. Readers familiar with operations for infected total hip arthroplasties will immediately recognize current procedures are far less radical than those typically used in Girdlestone’s time. Rarely would an infected arthroplasty be treated with such radical excision of bone and muscle, open packing, and secondary healing. For that reason, I suggest the name Girdlestone not be used for contemporary operations except as they apply to what he described: excision arthroplasty more accurately describes current procedures.
