Clinical longevity of composite resin restorations is a significant problem in adhesive dentistry. Most of the current simplified adhesives present good immediate bonding, but the bond strength gradually falls over a period due to biodegradation at the resin-dentin interface. Various strategies have been proposed to improve the durability of resin-dentin bond including the use of matrix metalloproteinases inhibitors and collagen cross-linkers, biomimetic remineralization, ethanol wet bonding, to improve the physical and mechanical properties of the bonding substrate, i.e., dentin. However, all are under preliminary research and without any conclusive evidence. Therefore, this paper addresses the current challenge in dental adhesion, i.e., poor durability of resin-dentin bond and introduces the concept of dentin biomodification as an alternative way for improving the long-term bonding effectiveness of current adhesives to dentin and also provides an overview of a synthetic collagen cross-linking agent carbodiimide (EDC) including its mechanism of action, literature review of studies evaluating EDC, variables associated with its use and its cytotoxicity. Search was performed across the electronic databases (PubMed, Ebsco host, and Google search engine) to identify manuscripts for inclusion, using the keywords: carbodiimide, dentin bonding, durability, resin-dentin interface, and collagen cross-linking. Thirty-five articles were finally included, and the last search was made in February 2016.
