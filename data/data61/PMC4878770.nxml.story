Homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material during cell division at meiosis by the process of crossover recombination. Although such crossover events are visually identifiable by cytogenetic techniques, it has remained a challenge to pinpoint the location of crossovers at the DNA sequence level. An emerging novel possibility to approach this challenge is to exploit the high resolution offered by re-sequencing of multiple individuals in species in which a genome assembly is available. Specifically, by sequencing members of a family, the inheritance of chromosomal segments can be followed and the location of crossover as well as non-crossover recombination determined. We performed such an endeavour in the collared flycatcher, a songbird species that has been in focus for extensive ecological and evolutionary research. We found that crossover events were concentrated to certain ‘hot-spot’ regions, and that the density of such events was highest in and close to genes. A higher rate of crossover recombination was found in males than in females and in males, but not in females, the rate of crossover increased towards ends of chromosomes. The location of non-crossovers was significantly associated with that of crossovers. We could further document an unbalanced transmission of genetic variants at non-crossover events via to the process of GC-biased gene conversion.
