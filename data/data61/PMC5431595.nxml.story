The expression and correlation analysis of the regenerating gene family member 4 (RegIV) and vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF-A and VEGF-C) in metastatic spinal tumors were studied. Fifteen patients with metastatic spinal tumors who underwent operation in our hospital from January 2011 to January 2013 were selected into this study. The expression level of tumor tissues in patients with spinal metastasis and RegIV, VEGF-A and VEGF-C of the corresponding paracancer normal tissue samples were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining method and the correlation between the expression of RegIV, VEGF-A and VEGF-C was analyzed. qRT-PCR results showed that the expression of RegIV was increased (P<0.05) in paracancer normal tissues and spinal metastatic tumor tissues. Compared with normal tissues, expression of RegIV, VEGF-A and VEGF-C was higher in metastatic spinal tumor tissues and the difference had statistical difference (P<0.05). Spearman's correlation analysis showed that the expression of RegIV was positively correlated with VEGF-A (r=0.683, P<0.05); the expression of RegIV positively correlated with VEGF-C (r=0.717, P<0.05). Cox regression analysis showed that RegIV, VEGF-A, VEGF-C expression and microvessel density counts are prognostic factors affecting spine metastasis (P<0.05), RegIV expression affected the survival of patients with relative risk. The high expression of RegIV in spinal metastatic tumors may promote the expression of VEGF-A and VEGF-C to increase the microvascular density, promote angiogenesis, and accelerate the occurrence and progression of spinal metastatic tumors.
