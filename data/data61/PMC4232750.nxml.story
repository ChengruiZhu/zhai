Roots from extracted human teeth were sealed with a flowable composite. In the cervical area, a 3-mm-wide circular window was ground through the seal 1 mm deep into dentine. The pulp lumen was connected to a reservoir of artificial dentinal fluid (ADF) containing protein, mineral salts and methylene blue. At increased pulpal pressure, the ADF released through the said window was collected in containers each with 20 ml of physiologic saline for a consecutive series of 30-min intervals and ADF concentration (absorption) was determined photometrically. The model was verified by three experiments. In experiment 1, the lower limit of quantification (LLoQ, coefficient of variation = 20 % and difference of 5 standard deviations (SD) from blank) of ADF in physiologic saline was determined by measuring the absorption of 15 dilutions of ADF in physiologic saline (containing 0.625 ng to 12.5 μg methylene blue/ml) photometrically for ten times. In experiment 2, long-term linearity of ADF perfusion/outflow was investigated using 11 specimens. The ADF released through the window was collected in the said containers separately for each consecutive interval of 30 min for up to 240 min. Absorption was determined and analysed by linear regression over time. In experiment 3, perfusion before (2×) and after single treatment according to the following three groups was measured: BisGMA-based sealant (Seal&Protect®), an acidic fluoride solution (elmex fluid®) and control (no treatment).
