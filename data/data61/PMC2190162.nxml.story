Friend leukemia virus (FV) suppressed the proliferative responses of spleen, lymph node, marrow, and thymus cell populations to various T- and B-cell mitogens. Cells taken from mice, e.g. BALB/c genetically susceptible to leukemogenesis in vivo were much more susceptible to suppression of mitogenesis in vitro than similar cells from genetically resistant mice, e.g., C57BL/6. Nylon wool-purified splenic T cells from BALB/c and C3H mice lost susceptibility to FV-induced suppression of mitogenesis but became suppressible by addition of 10% unfiltered spleen cell. Thus, FV mediates in vitro suppression of lymphocyte proliferation indirectly by "activating" a suppressor cell. The suppressor cell adhered to nylon wool but not to glass wool or rayon wool columns. Pretreatment of spleen cells with carbonyl iron and a magnet did not abrogate the suppressor cell function. Suppressor cells were not eliminated by treatment with rabbit antimouse immunoglobulin (7S) and complement (C). However, high concentrations of anti-Thy-1 plus C destroyed suppressor cells of the spleen; thymic suppressor cells were much more susceptible to anti-Thy-1 serum. Nude athymic mice were devoid of suppressor cells and their B-cell proliferation was relatively resistant to FV-induced suppression in vitro. The suppressor cells in the thymus (but not in the spleen) were eliminated by treatment of mice with cortisol. Thus, FV appears to mediate its suppressive effect on mitogen-responsive lymphocytes by affecting "T- suppressor cells." Spleen cells from C57BL/6 mice treated with 89Sr to destroy marrow-dependent (M) cells were much more suppressible by FV in virto than normal C57BL/6 spleen cells. However, nylon-filtered spleen cells of 89Sr-treated C57BL/6 mice were resistant to FV-induced suppression in vitro, indicating that the susceptibility of spleen cells from 89Sr-treated B6 mice is also mediated by suppressor cells. Normal B6 splenic T cells were rendered susceptible to FV-induced suppression of mitogenesis by addition of 10% spleen cells from 89Sr- treated B6 mice. Thus, M cells appear to regulate the numbers and/or functions of T-suppressor cells which in turn mediate the immunosuppressive effects of FV in vitro. Neither mitogen-responsive lymphocytes nor T-suppressor cells are genetically resistant or susceptible to FV. The genetic resistance to FV is apparently a function of M cells, both in vitro as well as in vivo.
