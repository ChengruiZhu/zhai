 African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, is a serious illness that is thought to affect many tens of thousands of people each year in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease is caused by a single-celled parasite that is transmitted to people when they are bitten by an infected Tsetse fly. If the initial phase of the disease is not recognized and treated, the parasite infects the brain, resulting in confusion, sleep problems, and ultimately coma and death. Few treatment options exist, and the most commonly used drug, melarsoprol, is highly toxic; furthermore, parasites are evolving resistance to it in some regions. There is an urgent need to develop new drugs and to evaluate combinations of existing drugs for activity against African trypanosomiasis. Therefore a group of researchers from Epicentre, Médecins Sans Frontières, and the National Sleeping Sickness Control Programme in Uganda performed a trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of three drug combinations. The combinations compared were melarsoprol-nifurtimox, melarsoprol-eflornithine, and nifurtimox-eflornithine, and the researchers planned to recruit 435 people with second-stage African trypanosomiasis in Uganda who would be followed up for 24 months. The primary outcome for the trial was cure rate following treatment. However, once 54 patients had been recruited into the trial, it was obvious that the death rate was much higher among individuals receiving melarsoprol-nifurtimox; the trial was therefore stopped for ethical reasons and this paper reports the results obtained up to that point.
