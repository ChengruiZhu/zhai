 (Lepidoptera: Drepanidae) is an excellent model for studying vibratory communication and sociality in larval insects. Vibratory communication occurs throughout development, but the functions of signals are reported to change as larvae change from gregarious to solitary lifestyles. To better understand the sensory ecology of these caterpillars, it is important to study their life history. Here, we describe the morphological and behavioral characteristics of larvae by confirming the number of instars, identifying their distinguishing morphological features, and noting changes in feeding and shelter construction. Five instars were confirmed based on the number of head capsules collected for individuals throughout development, and by using Dyarâ€™s rule, which predicts the number of instars based on geometric growth patterns of head capsules. Frequency distributions of head capsule widths showed five separate peaks, indicating that this is a useful parameter for distinguishing between instars. Other morphological features including body length, shape, and banding patterns of head capsules, and morphology of thoracic verrucae are helpful in distinguishing among instars. Feeding behavior changes from leaf skeletonization in first and second instars to leaf cutting in fourth and fifth instars, with third instars transitioning between these feeding styles as they grow. Early instars typically construct communal silken shelters whereas late instars live solitarily in leaf shelters. These results provide essential life history information on the masked birch caterpillar that will enable future investigations on the proximate and ultimate mechanisms associated with social behavior and communication in larval insects.
