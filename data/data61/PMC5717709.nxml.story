The silk of silkworm consists of fibroin fiber coated by sericins. In addition, some nonprotein components were also identified in the sericin fraction. The presence of nonprotein components in the silk has not been well explained. In the present study, methods based on gas chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry were used to identify the metabolites in the cocoon silk from a wild silkworm and two domestic silkworm strains. In total, 45 metabolites were in the cocoon silk, including organic acids, fatty acids, carbohydrates, amino acids, and hydrocarbons. Comparative analyses revealed that 17 metabolites were significant more in the wild silkworm cocoon than in the domestic silkworm cocoon, including three organic acids, three fatty acids, three aldoses, four sugar alcohols, three hydrocarbons, and pyridine. Of them, citric acid in the wild silkworm cocoon is more than 40 times that in the domestic silkworm cocoon, which may have protective value against microbes. The carbohydrate, lipid, and the long-chain hydrocarbons may act as water repellent to make the pupa survive longer in the dry environment. Many metabolites in the cocoon silk may play roles to improve the silk resistance. Lots of nonprotein components were identified in the silk for the first time, providing useful data for understanding the biological function of the cocoon silk.
