Metacaspases are evolutionarily distant homologs of caspases that are found outside the metazoan and are known to have key roles in programmed cell death (PCD). Two types of metacaspases (types I and II) have been defined in plants based on their domain structures; these have similarities to metazoan ‘initiator' and ‘executioner' caspases. However, we know little about metacaspases in unicellular organisms and even less about their roles in cell death. We identified a novel group of metacaspases in sequenced phytoplanktonic protists that show domain architectures distinct from either type I or II enzymes; we designate them as type III. Type III metacaspases exhibit a rearrangement of domain structures between N- and C-terminus. In addition, we found a group of metacaspase-like proteases in phytoplankton that show sequence homology with other metacaspases, but defy classification in conventional schemes. These metacaspase-like proteases exist in bacteria alongside a variant of type I metacaspases and we propose these bacterial metacaspases are the origins of eukaryotic metacaspases. Type II and III metacaspases were not detected in bacteria and they might be variants of bacterial type I metacaspases that evolved in plants and phytoplanktonic protists, respectively, during the establishment of plastids through the primary and secondary endosymbiotic events. A complete absence of metacaspases in protists that lost plastids, such as oömycetes and ciliates indicates the gene loss during the plastid-to-nucleus gene transfer. Taken together, our findings suggest endosymbiotic gene transfer (EGT) is a key mechanism resulting in the evolutionary diversity of cell death proteases.
