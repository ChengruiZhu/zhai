The aim of this study was to isolate human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from the gingiva (GMSCs) and confirm their multiple differentiation potentials, including the odontogenic lineage. GMSCs, periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) and dermal stem cells (DSCs) cultures were analyzed for cell shape, cell cycle, colony-forming unit-fibroblast (CFU-F) and stem cell markers. Cells were then induced for osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation and analyzed for differentiation markers (alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, mineralization nodule formation and Runx2, ALP, osteocalcin (OCN) and collagen I expressions for the osteogenic differentiation, and lipid vacuole formation and PPARÎ³-2 expression for the adipogenic differentiation). Besides, the odontogenic differentiation potential of GMSCs induced with embryonic tooth germ cell-conditioned medium (ETGC-CM) was observed. GMSCs, PDLSCs and DSCs were all stromal origin. PDLSCs showed much higher osteogenic differentiation ability but lower adipogenic differentiation potential than DSCs. GMSCs showed the medial osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation potentials between those of PDLSCs and DSCs. GMSCs were capable of expressing the odontogenic genes after ETGC-CM induction. This study provides evidence that GMSCs can be used in tissue engineering/regeneration protocols as an approachable stem cell source.
