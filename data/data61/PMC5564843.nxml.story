MicroRNAs, a family of single-stranded and non-coding RNAs, play a crucial role in regulating gene expression at posttranscriptional level, by which it can mediate various types of physiological and pathological process in normal developmental progress and human disease, including cancer. The microRNA-133b originally defined as canonical muscle-specific microRNAs considering their function to the development and health of mammalian skeletal and cardiac muscles, but new findings coming from our group and others revealed that miR-133b have frequently abnormal expression in various kinds of human cancer and its complex complicated regulatory networks affects the tumorigenicity and development of malignant tumors. Very few existing reviews on miR-133b, until now, are principally about its role in homologous cluster (miR-1, âˆ’133 and -206s), however, most of constantly emerging new researches now are focused mainly on one of them, so In this article, to highlight the unique pathological role of miR-133b playing in tumor, we conduct a review to summarize the current understanding about one of the muscle-specific microRNAs, namely miR-133b, acting in human cancer. The review focused on the following four aspects: the overview of miR-133b, the target genes of miR-133b involved in human cancer, the expression of miR-133b and regulatory mechanisms leading to abnormal expression of miR-133b.
