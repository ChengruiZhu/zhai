Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients with low triiodothyronine (T3) syndrome characterized by low free T3 (fT3) levels with normal thyroxine (T4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) have a higher rate of death. The impact of fT3 on Health related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with ACS is still unknown. 528 ACS patients treated with drug-eluting stent (DES) were included in this prospective, observational study. Patients were classified into low fT3 group (n=126) and normal fT3 group (n=402) according to serum fT3 level. Every patient was prospectively interviewed at baseline and 1 year following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). HRQOL was assessed with the use of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). Low fT3 patients had poorer HRQOL than normal fT3 patients both at baseline and 1-year follow-up (all p<0.05). During 1-year follow-up, HRQOL scores for all patients were significantly higher than baseline. Low fT3 patients had lesser gains in physical functioning, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning and role emotional (all p<0.05). Generally, low fT3 patients demonstrated less improvement in Physical Component Score (PCS) (p=0.008) and Mental Component Score (MCS) (p=0.001). The percentage of patients reaching MCID for PCS and MCS was lower in low fT3 group than that in normal fT3 group (p<0.001). Multivariate linear regression analyses showed that low level of fT3 was an independent risk factor for PCS and MCS improvements. In conclusion, a low fT3 level is a predictor of worse HRQOL improvement in ACS patients treated with DES.
