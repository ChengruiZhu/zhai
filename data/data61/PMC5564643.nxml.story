Increasing numbers of reports have been published to demonstrate that molecular targeted agents are able to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy in gastric cancer. This network meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of different molecular targeted agents, which were divided into six groups based on the targets including hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-MET), vascular endothelial factor and its receptor (VEGF/VEGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). These six groups of targeted agents were evaluated for their efficacy outcomes measured by overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR). While their safety was measured 7 adverse events, including fatigue, anaemia, vomiting, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea and nausea. A total of 23 articles were included after extensive searching and strict inclusion, HER2 and VEGF(R) turned out to be the two most effective targeted drugs for their outstanding performance in OS and PFS. However, they were associated with severe adverse events, including fatigue, neutropenia and diarrhea. Therefore, they should be used with caution during their application. In conclusion, VEGF(R) and HER2 have the potential to be the optimal target agents for their survival efficacy, while the adverse events associated with them should be paid attention in application.
