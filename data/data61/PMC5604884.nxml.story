 hybridization, immunohistochemistry and quantitative image analysis, we found CCL5 mRNA and protein was constitutively expressed in the inner retina and synaptic layers. CCL5 appeared to associate with MÃ¼ller cells and RGCs as well as synaptic connections between horizontal cells and bipolar cells in the OPL and amacrine cells, bipolar cells and RGCs in the IPL. Although all three high-affinity receptors (CCR5, CCR3, CCR1) for CCL5 were expressed constitutively, CCR5 expression was significantly higher than CCR3, which was also markedly greater than CCR1. Localization patterns for constitutive CCR5, CCR3 and CCR1 expression differed, particularly with respect to expression in inner retinal neurons. Stress-related expression of CCL5 was primarily altered in aged DBA/2 mice with elevated IOP. In contrast, changes in expression and localization of both CCR3 and CCR5 were evident not only in aged DBA/2 mice, but also in age-matched control mice and young DBA/2 mice. These groups do not exhibit elevated IOP, but possess either the aging stress (control mice) or the genetic predisposition to glaucoma (DBA/2 mice). Together, these data indicate that CCL5 and its high-affinity receptors are constitutively expressed in murine retina and differentially induced by stressors associated with glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Localization patterns further indicate that CCL5 signaling may be relevant for modulation of synapses in both health and disease, particularly in the inner plexiform layer.
