The presence and strength of interactions between species has frequently been inferred from observational data on changes in species abundance. For example, correlated cycles in potential predator and prey species may be interpreted as evidence that the species interact, while the absence of such coupled oscillations might be interpreted as evidence for lack of interaction. Here we show that prey abundance can be decoupled from changes in predator abundance when there is genetic variability in the prey for antipredator defense traits, allowing rapid evolutionary changes in prey defense levels. It then appears that the two species are not interacting, when in fact they are. We deduce this from studies of two laboratory microcosm systems, one with algae consumed by rotifers and the other with bacteria attacked by phage. In each, when the prey vary genetically for defense traits and undefended genotypes are superior competitors, defended and undefended prey frequencies evolve in a cyclical way that is almost exactly counterbalancing, so that total prey density remains nearly constant. We show mathematically that these “cryptic cycles” occur whenever conditions are right for predator-prey cycles, when prey vary genetically for defense traits, and when prey defense against predation is effective but inexpensive to produce. Under these conditions, observations of predator and prey population dynamics cannot be trusted to be informative about the strength or even the existence of interspecific trophic links.
