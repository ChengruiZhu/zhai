The objective of the present study was to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of pre-operative transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for unresectable hepatoblastoma in infants and children. A total of 24 patients (14 males and 10 females) with unresectable hepatoblastoma, aged between 26 days and 41 months, were treated with pre-operative TACE between March 2007 and March 2011. All cases were confirmed by computed tomography (CT) and liver tumor biopsy prior to TACE. Arteriography was performed and the chemoembolization mixture (pirarubicin and cisplatin emulsified in lipiodol) was injected, followed by polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The procedure was performed one to four times depending on the patient’s response. There was a significant reduction in tumor volume associated with decreased α-fetoprotein (AFP) levels following TACE. Tumor volumes decreased by between 46.1 and 90.2%, with a mean value of 72%. The AFP levels fell by between 63.8 and 99.9%, with a mean value of 95.7%. A total of 22 cases underwent subsequent safe complete surgical resection and the remaining two patients accepted a partial resection. To evaluate the toxicity of TACE, the alanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum creatinine (Cr) and creatine kinase (CK) levels of the patients were measured to assess liver, renal and cardiac function, respectively. The results showed that no marked chemotherapeutic agent-induced toxicity occurred during TACE. It may be concluded that TACE is an effective and feasible pre-operative therapeutic approach for treating unresectable hepatoblastoma and that it may improve the resectability of bulky liver tumors.
