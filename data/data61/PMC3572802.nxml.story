The purpose of this study was to investigate effect of nutrition education at worksite program in male workers. The subjects were 75 male workers who had received nutrition education by a clinical dietitian for 4 months. The anthropometric data, blood pressure and biochemical blood indices were measured before and after nutrition education. Dietary habits and lifestyle were investigated by self-administered questionnaires. Nutrients intake was determined by 24-hour dietary recall method. The results showed significant decreases in body mass index (p < 0.05), fasting blood sugar (p < 0.01), total cholesterol (p < 0.05), and LDL-cholesterol (p < 0.05) after nutrition education. The correlation analyses among anthropometric and clinical parameters after nutrition education indicated that there was a significantly positive correlations between blood pressure and weight, r-GTP. A significantly positive correlations was observed between fasting blood sugar and triglycerides. A significantly positive correlations was observed between triglycerides and body mass index, r-GTP, SGPT. A significantly positive correlations was observed between SGPT and weight, body mass index. A significantly negative correlations was observed between HDL-cholesterol and weight. It could be concluded that nutrition education might be effective tool to improve anthropometric measures and clinical parameters in male workers. Continuing and systematic nutritional management programs should be developed and implemented for male workers at the worksites to maintain optimal health status.
