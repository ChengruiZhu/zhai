FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in patients with suspected ovarian cancer recurrence and describe the distribution of metastasis. A total of 45 female patients who underwent PET/CT scan due to raised CA-125 levels, clinical suspicion of ovarian cancer recurrence or alterations detected on ultrasound (US), CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were included in this retrospective study. PET/CT results were compared with histological findings (n=15) or clinical, laboratory and repeated imaging techniques during subsequent follow-up for at least six months (n=30). CA-125 was elevated in 34 patients, 14 patients had clinical symptoms of disease and 23 presented with alterations on US, CT and MRI. A total of 42 patients were confirmed to have ovarian cancer recurrence, all with abnormal findings on PET/CT. Three patients remained free of disease during clinical follow-up, all with normal PET/CT findings. There were 11 patients with raised CA-125 levels and normal conventional imaging, all with positive PET/CT. Among the 11 patients with normal CA-125 levels, eight presented with positive PET/CT scan. Lymph nodes were the most frequent site of relapse of disease, followed by peritoneal implants. Distant sites of metastasis included the liver, spleen, pleura, lung and bone. PET/CT detected unsuspected lesions in 20/45 patients (44.4%).
