In every round of the cell cycle, cells must accurately replicate their full genetic information. This process is highly regulated, as defects during DNA replication cause genomic instability, leading to various genetic disorders including cancers. To thwart these problems, cells carry an array of complex mechanisms to deal with various obstacles found across the genome that can hamper DNA replication and cause DNA damage. Understanding how these mechanisms are regulated and orchestrated is of paramount importance in the field. In this report, we describe how Swi1, a Timeless-related protein in fission yeast, regulates efficient replication of telomeres, which are considered to be difficult to replicate due to the presence of repetitive DNA and telomere-binding proteins. We show that Swi1 prevents telomere damage and maintains telomere length by protecting integrity of telomeric repeats. Swi1-mediated telomere maintenance is independent of telomerase activity, and loss of Swi1 causes hyper-activation of recombination-based telomere maintenance, which generates heterogeneous telomeres. Similar telomerase-independent and recombination-dependent mechanism is utilized by approximately 15% of human cancers, linking telomere replication defects with cancer development. Thus, our study may be relevant in understanding the role of telomere replication defects in the development of cancers in humans.
