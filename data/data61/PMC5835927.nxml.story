The concentration and distribution of rare earth elements (REE) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) were measured to investigate connections with tumor size, lymph node metastasis, clinical stages, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. There were 30 patients with NPC who met the criteria for inclusion in the present study. The EBV copy number, as well as the concentration and distribution of REE, was analyzed. EBV was detected using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, with the concentrations of REE in NPC tissues measured using inductively coupled plasma-tandem mass spectrometry. The mean values were used when comparing concentrations of REE in NPC tissues as the standard deviation of this parameter was the lowest. Light REE had the highest concentrations, followed by medium, and then heavy REE. The concentrations of REE decreased with increasing tumor size and with the presence of lymph node metastasis. The concentrations of REE gradually increased between stage II and IVa, but markedly decreased thereafter. The elements that exhibited the greatest decreases were terbium, holmium and ytterbium. Furthermore, the concentrations of REE in NPC were not associated with sex (r=0.301, P=0.106) or age (r=−0.011, P=0.955), and were negatively associated with EBV (r=−0.744, P<0.001). By contrast, the EBV copy number increased alongside advancements in clinical stage. Changes in the concentrations of REE in NPC were more prominent for medium and heavy elements. Additionally, alterations in the concentrations of heavy REE may affect the occurrence and development of NPC.
