A convenience sample of 136 patients of all ages was retrospectively analyzed by evaluating the outpatient knee clinic appointment list of one orthopaedic surgeon for patients with a broad range of knee injuries who had a prior MRI before (24%) or after (76%) physical examination and had a duck walk test stated in their patient records. Of 230 patients with MRI requested by one orthopaedic surgeon attributable to knee complaints, 136 (59%) fulfilled the inclusion criteria; 70 (52%) patients were male and 66 (49%) were female, with a mean age of 42 (± SD 14) years. The duck walk test was performed in case of suspected meniscal injury, based on mechanism of injury, general joint line pain, and/or mechanical complaints (ie, locking, giving away). The test is performed by squatting and “waddling” before rising and is positive in case of general joint line pain or painful “clicking”. Interobserver repeatability was not evaluated, but the test is well defined and leaves little room for difference in interpretation. Diagnostic accuracy measures were evaluated. Since the convenience sample in this study consisted of patients who had a duck walk test and MRI, and a positive result of the duck walk test almost certainly increased the probability that MRI would be ordered in the majority (76%) of the patients, the test properties calculated here—especially sensitivity—should be considered inflated.
