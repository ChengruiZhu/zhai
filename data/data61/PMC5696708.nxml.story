Stomatin-like protein 2 (SLP-2) is overexpressed in numerous types of human cancer and previous studies revealed that SLP-2 may function in mitochondria. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the expression of SLP-2 in cervical cancer and the association between SLP-2 expression and clinical features, in addition to investigating the role of SLP-2 in the apoptosis of cervical cancer cells. The expression profile of SLP-2 was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and immunohistochemical staining. The effect of SLP-2 on cell apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutics in cervical cancer cells was evaluated using Annexin V staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays. The results indicated that SLP-2 expression in cervical cancer was significantly upregulated at the mRNA and protein levels, compared with that in normal cervical tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed significant correlation between SLP-2 protein expression and clinical characteristics, including the squamous cell carcinoma antigen (P=0.003), deep stromal invasion (P=0.021), lymphovascular space involvement (P=0.044) and pelvic lymph node metastasis (P<0.001), which served as independent prognostic factors for predicting the shortening of overall survival time in patients with early-stage cervical cancer. In addition, TUNEL and Annexin V binding assays revealed that silencing SLP-2 expression significantly enhanced the sensitivity of cervical cancer cells to apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutics. Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that SLP-2 may be a progressive gene in the development of cervical cancer. Overexpression of SLP-2 serves an important role in the apoptosis of human cervical cancer cells.
