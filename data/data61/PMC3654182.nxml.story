Numerous whole-body vibration (WBV) devices of various forces are available on the market, although their influence on the musculoskeletal system is not yet understood. The effect of different WBVs on bone healing and muscle function was evaluated in rats ovariectomized at 3 months of age. 2 months after ovariectomy, bilateral metaphyseal tibia osteotomy and T-plate osteosynthesis were performed. Rats were divided into groups: intact, OVX, and OVX exposed to vertical WBVs of 35, 50, 70, or 90 Hz (experiment 1) or horizontal WBVs of 30, 50, 70, or 90 Hz (experiment 2) 5 days after osteotomy (0.5 mm, 15 min/day for 30 days). The tibia and gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were collected. Vertical vibrations (>35 Hz) improved cortical and callus densities, enlarged callus area and width, suppressed the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase gene, enhanced citrate synthase activity, accelerated osteotomy bridging (35 and 50 Hz), upregulated the osteocalcin (Oc) gene (70 Hz), and increased relative muscle weight (50 Hz). Horizontal vibrations reduced cortical width (<90 Hz) and callus density (30 Hz), enhanced alkaline phosphatase (Alp) gene expression (50 Hz), decreased the size of oxidative fibers (35 and 70 Hz), and increased capillary density (70, 90 Hz). Biomechanical data; serum Oc, Alp, and creatine kinase activities; body weight; and food intake did not change after WBVs. Vertical WBVs of 35 and 50 Hz produced more favorable results than the higher frequencies. Horizontal WBV showed no positive or negative effects. Further studies are needed to elucidate the effects of WBV on different physiological systems, and precautions must be taken when implementing WBV in the treatment of patients.
