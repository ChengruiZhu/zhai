Obesity is a major risk factor for endometrial cancer (EC). Yet, its impact on prognosis is controversial. Obesity is associated with metabolic and hormonal dysregulation as well as adipokines increase. The aim of this study was to characterize the expression of biological factors related to obesity within the tumor and evaluate their impact on prognosis. One hundred and thirty-six patients, including 55 obese patients, with endometrioid type I EC operated by total hysterectomy were included in this retrospective study conducted in a Tertiary teaching hospital between 2000 and 2013. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) study was performed on type I EC tumor samples using five adipokines (SPARC, RBP4 (Retinol Binding Protein 4), adiponectin, TNF Î±, IL-6) and hormonal receptors (estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor). Supervised clustering of immunohistochemical markers was performed to identify clusters that could be associated with prognostic groups. The prognosis of the obese population was not different from the prognosis of the general population. Adipokine expression within tumors was not different in these two populations. In obese population, we found three clusters where co-expression was associated with a recurrence group in comparison with a non-recurrence group and four clusters where co-expression was associated with the high risk FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) stage I group in comparison of low risk FIGO stage I group. While obesity does not appear as a prognostic factor in endometrioid type I EC, the co-expression of biological factors in IHC on hysterectomy specimens allowed to distinguish two prognostic groups in obese population.
