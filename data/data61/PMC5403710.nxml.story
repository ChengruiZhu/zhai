Chemotherapy and targeted therapies are effective palliative options for numerous unresectable or metastatic cancers. However, treatment resistance inevitably develops leading to mortality. In a subset of patients, systemic therapy appears to control the majority of tumors leaving 5 or less to progress, a phenomenon described as oligoprogression. Reasoning that the majority of lesions remain responsive to ongoing systemic chemotherapy, we hypothesized that local treatment of the progressing lesions would confer a benefit. The present study describes the cases of 5 patients whose metastatic disease was largely controlled by chemotherapy. The oligoprogressive lesions (≤5) were treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), justifying continued use of an effective systemic regimen. A total of 5 patients with metastatic disease on chemotherapy, with ≤5 progressing lesions amenable to SBRT, were treated with ablative intent. Primary tumor site and histology were as follows: 2 with metastatic colon adenocarcinoma, 2 with metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma and 1 with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Imaging was performed prior to SBRT and every 3 months after SBRT. In total, 4 out of the 5 patients achieved disease control for >7 months with SBRT, without changing chemotherapy regimen. The median time to chemotherapy change was 9 months, with a median follow-up time of 9 months. The patient who failed to respond developed progressive disease outside of the SBRT field at 3 months. In conclusion, the addition of SBRT to chemotherapy is an option for the overall systemic control of oligoprogressive disease.
