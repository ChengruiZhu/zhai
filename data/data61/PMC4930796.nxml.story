The pathophysiology of exocrine dysfunction observed in Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) is not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether autoantibodies against human AQP5 are present in the sera of SS patients. Frozen sections of mouse submandibular salivary glands, CHO cells over-expressing a human AQP5–GFP fusion protein or GFP, and MDCK cells over-expressing AQP5 were used in the indirect immunofluorescence assay to detect anti-AQP5 autoantibodies in the sera from patients with primary SS. The lysates of HEK-293 cells over-expressing the AQP5–GFP fusion protein or GFP were used for immunoprecipitation. Serum IgG from the SS patients but not from the control subjects stained acinar cells in the mouse salivary glands, the signals of which colocalized with those of AQP5-specific antibodies. Serum IgG from the SS patients also selectively stained AQP5–GFP expressed in CHO cells. However, both the control and SS sera immunoprecipitated the AQP5–GFP, suggesting that autoantibodies against AQP5 were also present in the control sera. The screening of 53 control and 112 SS samples by indirect immunofluorescence assay using the AQP5-expressing MDCK cells revealed the presence of significantly higher levels of anti-AQP5 IgG in the SS samples than in the control samples with sensitivity of 0.73 and a specificity of 0.68. Furthermore, the presence of anti-AQP5 autoantibodies was associated with low resting salivary flow in SS patients. In conclusion, anti-AQP5 autoantibodies were detected in the sera from SS patients, which could be a novel biomarker of SS and provide new insight into the pathogenesis of SS.
