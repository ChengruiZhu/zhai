Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are reported to exert prophylactic and acute therapeutic effects in diseases linked to endothelial dysfunction. In the present study, the consequences of a PUFA enrichment of endothelial cells (cell line TIME) on cell viability, expression of the cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), synthesis of the adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), and production of the coagulation factors plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), von Willebrand factor (vWF), and tissue factor (TF) was analyzed in parallel. PUFA of both the n3 and the n6 family were investigated in a physiologically relevant concentration of 15 µM, and experiments were performed in both the presence and the absence of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Supplementation of the culture medium with particular fatty acids was found to have a promoting effect on cellular production of the cytokines IL-6, IL-8, GM-CSF, and MCP-1. Further on, PUFA treatment in the absence of a stimulant diminished the percentage of endothelial cells positive for ICAM-1, and adversely affected the stimulation-induced upregulation of VCAM-1. Cell viability and production of coagulation factors were not or only marginally affected by supplemented fatty acids. Altogether, the data indicate that PUFA of either family are only partially able to counterbalance the destructive consequences of an endothelial dysfunction.
