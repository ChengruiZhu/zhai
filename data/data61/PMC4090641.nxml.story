WMH was detected in 18 methamphetamine users, in 12 methadone users and in seven controls (P = 0.038). The site of brain lesions in MA users was mostly in the frontal lobe in 17 cases, in M users in the frontal lobe in 12 cases and in the control group, it was in the parietal lobe in four cases (P=0.001). The frontal lobes were the predominant locations of WMH in MA and M groups (P = 0.001). The frequency of brain lesions was mostly in the deep WM in 18 cases in MA users, in 12 cases in M users and in two cases in the control group (P=0.007). Hyper-signal foci of deep WM in the MA group were grade I (punctuate) in 12 cases, grade II (beginning confluence) in five cases and grade III (large confluent) in four cases. In the M group, there were six cases in grade I, three cases in grade II and one case in grade III. In the control group, there were three grade I cases, two grade II cases, and no grade III cases. Except for periventricular WMH (P = 0.13), there were statistical significant differences in the deep WMH (P = 0.007) and subcortex WMH (P = 0.01) between the three groups. The history of using other drugs and the duration of MA and M consumption were similar. The prevalence of brain lesions was generally higher in both drug user groups compared with the healthy controls. Increased WMH in the MA group was higher than the M group.
