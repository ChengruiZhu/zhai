The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between the expression of chemokine receptors CCR7 and CXCR4 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C and the lymph node metastasis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The mRNA transcription levels of CCR7, CXCR4 and VEGF-C were measured in 24 specimens by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, while the protein expression levels were measured in 65 specimens by immuohistochemistry. Professional software for pathological image manipulation (Image Pro Plus 6.0) was used to quantitate the results of the immunohistochemical staining. The mRNA and protein expression levels of CCR7, CXCR4 and VEGF-C were all significantly higher in the cancer samples compared with those in the adjacent normal tissue. The CCR7 and VEGF-C mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly higher in the patients with cancer types exhibiting lymph node metastasis and an advanced International Union Against Cancer (UICC) stage (P<0.05). The greater the number of metastatic lymph nodes, the higher the levels of CCR7 expression (P<0.05). There was a significant positive linear correlation between the mRNA and protein expression levels of CCR7 and VEGF-C (P<0.05). The mRNA and protein expression levels of CXCR4 were not correlated with the lymph node metastasis (P>0.05), however the strong positive expression of CCR7 and VEGF-C was significantly associated with the lymph node metastasis of PDAC.
