Under normal conditions, the electrical activation of the heart is almost synchronous, leading to uniform contraction. Due to either pathology or electrical pacing, the heart can be activated asynchronously. The result is discoordinated contraction and a reduction in the ability to pump blood. There is considerable interest in using computer simulations to understand how asynchronous electrical activation affects cardiac deformation, and how pathologies of the cardiac conduction system can be treated by pacing the heart. We present the MultiPatch module for simulating the effects of asynchronous electrical activation on cardiac contraction in the relatively simple CircAdapt model of the heart and circulation. We quantitatively compare model simulations to deformation patterns recorded during an experimental study of pacing-induced electrical asynchrony. We then demonstrate a ‘patient-specific’ simulation of deformation in a patient with a conduction disorder called left bundle-branch block. We use timings from endocardial mapping of electrical activation in a patient as an input for the model, and compare the resulting simulated deformation patterns to tagged magnetic resonance imaging recordings from the same patient. The model qualitatively reproduces deformation as observed in the patient. We conclude that the MultiPatch module makes CircAdapt appropriate for simulation of dyssynchronous heart failure in patients.
