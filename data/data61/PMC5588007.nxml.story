Patients with lymphoma are at high risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE). The purpose of the present study was to identify the target gene associated with VTE for patients with lymphoma. Microarray data was downloaded from the gene expression omnibus database (GSE17078), which comprised the control group, 27 normal blood outgrowth endothelial cell (BOEC) samples, and the case group, 3 BOEC samples of venous thrombosis with protein C deficiency. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by the Limma package of R. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed via the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery. Differentially coexpressed pairs were identified by the DCGL package of R. The subsequent protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and gene coexpression networks were constructed by the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins database, and were visualized by Cytoscape software. A total of 110 DEGs were obtained, including 73 upregulated and 37 downregulated genes. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses identified 132 significant GO terms and 9 significant KEGG pathways. In total, 97 PPI pairs for PPI network and 309 differential coexpression pairs for the gene coexpression network were obtained. Additionally, the connective tissue growth factor (
