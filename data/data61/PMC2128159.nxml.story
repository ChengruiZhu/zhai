 to influenza is further supported by the character of the respiratory disease that occurred in the monkeys. The sudden onset with profound prostration, the absence of leucocytosis or often a leucopenia, the congestion of the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract, the development on the 2nd or 3rd day of an irritative cough due to an inflammatory tracheitis or tracheobronchitis, the brief self-limited course of the infection, and the irregular febrile reactions are all characteristic of influenza. Many of these symptoms were in striking contrast with the symptoms and course of pneumococcus or streptococcus infections in monkeys in which there were no prostration at onset, invariable leucocytosis, and infrequent cough developing only late in the disease. While all the above features of the disease produced in monkeys are characteristic of influenza in man, none are pathognomonic and, in fact, it is doubtful whether uncomplicated influenza possesses any pathognomonic features by which it may be diagnosed certainly in the absence of an epidemic. Even during epidemic times many respiratory infections arise which, though presumably influenza, it is impossible to diagnose as such with certainty. Nor does pathology help in this respect, since there would appear to be no established distinctive lesions of uncomplicated influenza in man, nor for that matter of the complications of influenza, apart from the complications which have been ascribed by Pfeiffer,
