In the embryonic stage mammalian cells are pluripotent: they have not yet committed to any specific cell type. The commitment to a cell type is controlled by pluripotency networks, the bio-molecular inventory which is unsurprisingly complex, spanning a myriad of transcription factors, genes and epigenetic factors. Thanks to advances in high-throughput sequencing and related computational tools for data analysis, we are beginning to unravel basic topological features of pluripotency networks. Networks inferred from sequencing data are often cast in Boolean representations which specify the existence and nature of regulatory connections between pairs of biomolecules. While immensely useful, the Boolean networks remain silent about the stochasticity and dynamics of molecules that are indelible features of bio-molecular life inside cells. Understanding stochastic and dynamic features of pluripotency networks is crucial if one is to have a mechanistic understanding of cell fate determination rationalized in terms of fundamental physico-chemical processes. The computational framework proposed in this work offers a way of bridging the divide between Boolean networks and higher resolution views of networks in a predictive and quantitative manner. The usefulness of the framework is demonstrated by recapitulating a number of experimental trends and creating new insights about the stochastic and dynamical nature of pluripotency.
