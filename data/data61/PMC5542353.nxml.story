Patients who underwent ACLR with HS graft (n=79) sustained 14 ipsilateral tears and 6 contralateral ACL injuries. Patients who received an ACLR with BTB (n=62) sustained 2 ipsilateral tears and 12 contralateral ACL injuries (Table 1). Patients who received an ACLR with HS graft were 6 times more likely (RR=6.2; 95% CI: 1.4-28.7) to suffer a graft failure after RTS than the BTB group. In the first 12 months after RTS, the HS graft patients were nearly 10 times (RR=9.5; 95% CI: 1.2-76.1) more likely to suffer an ipsilateral graft failure. Patients with a HS graft were 3 times less likely (RR=0.33; 95%CI: 0.12-0.935) to suffer a contralateral ACL injury and nearly 7 times less likely (RR=0.15, 95%CI: 0.031-0.709) to suffer a contralateral ACL injury in the first 12 months after RTS compared to the BTB group. When the cohort was divided by sex, females with HS grafts were significantly more likely to sustain a graft failure in the first 12 months after RTS (p=0.008) and by final follow-up (p=0.002) compared to females with BTB graft. Females with HS grafts were 3 times less likely (RR=0.30; 95%CI: 0.095-0.943) to suffer a contralateral ACL injury than females with BTB graft and 6 times less likely (RR=0.17; 95%CI: 0.034-0.846) to suffer contralateral ACL injury in the first year after RTS. Males demonstrated no significant difference in ipsilateral or contralateral injury risk based on graft type.
