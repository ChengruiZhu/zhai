Sézary syndrome (SS) is a leukemic variant of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), and the neoplastic CD4+ T cells of SS patients undergo intense clonal proliferation. Although Sézary cells have been studied extensively, studies on adaptive immunity regarding CD8+T cells are scarce. This study aimed to investigate activation marker expression in CD8+ T cells according to the differentiation stages and IL-7/IL7Rα axis responses of patients with SS. Moreover, this study aimed to verify the soluble forms of CD38, sCD127 and IL-7 in serum. Although the SS patients of our cohort had reduced numbers of CD8+ T cells, they exhibited higher percentages of CD8+CD38+ T cells, mainly effector/memory CD8+ T cells, than the control group. In contrast, down-regulated expression of the activation markers CD127/IL-7R and CD26 was found in the CD8+ T cells of SS patients. High serum levels of sCD38 and sCD127 and scarce serum levels of IL-7 were detected, emphasizing the immune activation status of SS patients. Moreover, CD8+ T cells from SS patients exhibited IL-7 unresponsiveness to STAT5 phosphorylation and Bcl-2 expression, and IL-7 priming partially restored IFNγ production. Our findings showed a chronic activation profile of CD8+ T cells, as an attenuated cytotoxic profile and impaired IL-7 responsiveness was observed, suggesting chronic activation status of CD8+ T cells in SS patients.
