The occurrence of overweight, obesity and physical activity (PA) belongs to major factors influencing health. However, information on the longitudinal development of PA in Europe has been, up until now, insufficient. The aim of the study was to describe the changes in PA, sedentary behavior and BMI in the inhabitants of the Liberec region during the surveybetween 2002 – 2009. The data were obtained in 2002–2004 using the short version of the IPAQ questionnaire, in 2005–2009 using the long version of the IPAQ. The sample of participants comprised 957 males and 1066 females aged 25–60 years. A significant decrease in sitting accounting for minutes on working days has been recorded both in men and women. A significant increase of PA both in men and women was reported, however the interpretation of the increase needs to be done cautiously due to the application of the short and long version of the IPAQ. Regarding PA intensity, men show more PA in total than women, which can be explained mainly by the differences in vigorous PA. Women show significantly lower values of BMI in all years in which surveys were conducted than men (p<0.001). Based on self-reported data, we have recorded an increase in the number of overweight and obese people. Time spent sitting on working days has had a tendency to decrease, yet a negative trend in the decrease in self-reported total PA has not been confirmed. Despite the fact that there has been an increase in self-reported PA, no decrease in BMI was registered.
