 test or Fisher's exact probability test. Spearman's rank correlation was used to analyze correlations between STAT3, p-STAT3 and MUC1 expression. Univariate analysis was conducted using the Kaplan-Meier estimator curve method and Cox regression multivariate analysis was performed in order to determine prognostic factors. Results demonstrated that STAT3 and p-STAT3 expression was identified in 82 and 51 patients, respectively. Furthermore, the expression of MUC1 was identified in 61/98 cases (62.2%) and STAT3 expression was significantly associated with pathological tumor-node-metastasis stage (pTNM; P<0.01). p-STAT3 expression was associated with pathological type (P<0.01), pathological lymph nodes (pN; P<0.01) and pTNM (P<0.05). MUC1 expression was associated with pathological type (P<0.05), pathological tumor pT (P<0.05), pN (P<0.01) and pTNM (P<0.01). STAT3 expression was positively associated with p-STAT3 expression (P<0.05) and p-STAT3 expression was positively associated with MUC1 expression (P<0.01). Overall, the results identified that the 3-year survival rate was 56.1% and was significantly associated with the degree of differentiation (P<0.05), pT (P<0.01), pN (P<0.01), pTNM stage (P<0.01), p-STAT3 expression (P<0.01) and MUC1 expression (P<0.05). Results obtained from the Cox multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that pN and p-STAT3 expression were independent factors associated with the 3-year survival rate.
