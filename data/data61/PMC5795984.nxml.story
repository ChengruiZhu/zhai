Background: Burn scar pain is considered as neuropathic pain. The anti-inflammation and anti-neuroinflammation effects of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) were observed in several studies. We designed a study using a murine model involving the transplantation of autologous ASCs in rats subjected to burn injuries. The aim was to detect the anti-neuroinflammation effect of ASC transplantation and clarify the relationships between ASCs, scar pain, apoptosis and autophagy. Methods: We randomized 24 rats into 4 groups as followings: Group A and B, received saline injections and autologous transplantation of ASCs 4 weeks after sham burn, respectively; Group C and D, received saline injections and autologous transplantation 4 weeks after burn injuries. A designed behavior test was applied for pain evaluation. Skin tissues and dorsal horn of lumbar spinal cords were removed for biochemical analysis. Results: ASC transplantation significantly restored the mechanical threshold reduced by burn injury. It also attenuated local inflammation and central neuroinflammation and ameliorated apoptosis and autophagy in the spinal cord after the burn injury. Conclusion: In a rat model, autologous ASC subcutaneous transplantation in post-burn scars elicited anti-neuroinflammation effects locally and in the spinal cord that might be related to the relief of post-burn neuropathic pain and attenuated cell apoptosis. Thus, ASC transplantation post-burn scars shows the potential promising clinical benefits.
