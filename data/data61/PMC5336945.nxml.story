In this prospective study, a total of 41 consecutive outpatients who were referred to our echocardiography laboratory with mild diastolic dysfunction (age: 60.9±9.6 years) and 45 healthy control subjects who were referred from an outpatient clinic for check-up (age: 32.2±10.3 years) with normal diastolic function were enrolled into this study. All subjects had normal LA volume and normal right atrial area and did not have high filling pressure. Diastolic dysfunction were determined per American Society of Echocardiography recommendations; so, the following indices were measured: peak early (E) and atrial (A) flow velocities (cm/s), E/A ratio, and deceleration time (DT) (ms) of mitral inflow, systolic (S) and diastolic (D) pulmonary vein wave velocities (cm/s) by pulse wave Doppler, and e’ in septal and lateral mitral annulus by pulse wave tissue Doppler. Time interval from the onset of P wave on the ECG to the beginning of the late diastolic wave (Am wave) on tissue Doppler trace, which is named PA, was obtained from the lateral and septal mitral annulus and right ventricular (RV) tricuspid annulus as atrial conduction times (ACTs) and were named lateral PA, septal PA, and RV PA, respectively. The difference between lateral PA and septal, PA septal and RV PA was defined as left and right intra-atrial EMD, respectively. The difference between lateral PA and RV PA was defined as inter-atrial EMD. Data analysis was done by independent student’s t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, χ
