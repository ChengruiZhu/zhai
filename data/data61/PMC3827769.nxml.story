The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the number of repetition maxima to volitional failure (RM) at 60%, 75%, 90% of 1RM and fatigue index (FI), a determinant of the muscular endurance level. Thirty four resistance trained male participants attended two testing sessions. The first session was conducted to assess 1RM load and RM at 60%, 75% and 90% of 1RM in the supine biceps curl (SBC) exercise. In the second session, a FI test protocol consisting of five sets of SBC with 90 s rest between sets was performed to determine FI values. Each set was performed to volitional failure using a sub-maximal load in the range of 15-20RM. Hypothetical high FI and low FI groups (17 participants with the highest and lowest FI values, respectively) were formed for statistical analyses. ANOVA results revealed that RM at 60%, 75%, 90% of 1RM were not significantly different between FI groups when controlled for mean repetition tempo (p=0.11, p=0.38, p=0.13, respectively). Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficients revealed that no significant relationship was present between FI values and RM at 60%, 75%, 90% of 1RM (p=0.40, p=0.46, p=0.14, respectively). In conclusion, the muscular endurance level of participants defined in terms of FI value was not an indicator of RM in SBC. Therefore, athletes with different muscular endurance levels can use similar percentages of 1RM in biceps curl exercise in their training programs when the aim is to elicit training adaptations related to specific RM zones.
