This is a study protocol for an open-label RCT, in which 116 participants will be randomly allocated to an interventional or control group. A total of 58 participants per group will provide 90.0% power (Î±=0.05) to detect 10 degrees of difference (SD=16) in ROM, at 3 months post TKA. Participants assigned to the interventional group will receive the Maxm Skate in addition to standard care in the in-patient setting. Following discharge, participants will be asked to limit physiotherapy to Skate use only, and compliance will be documented. Outcomes will be compared to those receiving standard rehabilitative care. A blinded physiotherapist will evaluate functional outcomes preoperatively and at 2, 4, 6, 12, 26 and 52 weeks post TKA. The functional assessment will include measures of knee ROM, pain, isometric knee strength, balance, and knee/thigh circumference. Limited measures will also be assessed at Day 2 postoperatively by an alternate, un-blinded physiotherapist. Clinical and patient-reported outcome measures will be administered preoperatively, and at 6, 12 and 52 weeks postoperatively. An economic evaluation assessing the relative cost-effectiveness of the Maxm Skate rehabilitation device, compared to standard care, will be conducted. Patients will also be screened for adverse event occurrences and complications from the time of consent to 1 year postoperatively.
