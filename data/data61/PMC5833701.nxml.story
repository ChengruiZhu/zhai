The damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) released by necrotic cells can trigger inflammatory response, which will facilitate the clearance of these dead cells. Neutrophil mobilization is a very important step for the dead cell clearance, however the detailed mechanisms for DAMPs induce neutrophil mobilization remains largely elusive. In this study, by using a necrotic cell-induced neutrophil mobilization mice model, we found that both neutrophil number and percentage rapidly (as early as 30 min) increased with necrotic cells but not live cell treatment. CXCL1 was rapidly increased in the serum and was responsible for the neutrophil mobilization when treated with necrotic cells. We further demonstrated that the hepatocytes in the liver were the main source of CXCL1 production in response to necrotic cells challenge. However, the hepatocytes did not express CXCL1 when incubating with necrotic cells alone. When Kupffer cells were ablated, the increased CXCL1 levels as well as neutrophil mobilization were abolished with necrotic cells challenge. Moreover, we clarified Kupffer cells-derived TNF-α activates the NF-κB pathway in hepatocytes and promote hepatocytes to express CXCL1. In summary, we showed that the liver is the main source for necrotic cell-induced CXCL1 production and neutrophil mobilization. Kupffer cells in the liver sense DAMPs and release TNF-α to activate the NF-κB pathway in hepatocytes. The interaction between Kupffer cells and hepatocytes is critical for CXCL1 production.
