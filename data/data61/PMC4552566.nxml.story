Human metabolism is controlled through basic kinetic regulatory mechanisms, where the overall system aims to maintain a state of homeostasis. In response to external perturbations, such as environmental influences, nutrition or physical exercise, circulating metabolites show specific kinetic response patterns, which can be computationally modeled. In this work, we searched for dynamic metabolic biomarker candidates and analyzed specific kinetic mechanisms from longitudinal metabolic concentration data, obtained through a cycle ergometry stress test. In total, 110 metabolites measured from blood samples of 47 individuals were analyzed using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Dynamic biomarker candidates could be selected based on the amplitudes of changes in metabolite concentrations and the significance of statistical hypothesis testing. We were able to characterize specific kinetic patterns for groups of similarly behaving metabolites. Kinetic shape templates were identified, defining basic kinetic response patterns to physical exercise, such as sustained, early, late and other shape forms. The presented approach contributes to a better understanding of (patho)physiological biochemical mechanisms in human health, disease or during drug therapy, by offering tools for classifying dynamic biomarker candidates and for modeling and characterizing kinetic regulatory mechanisms from longitudinal experimental data.
