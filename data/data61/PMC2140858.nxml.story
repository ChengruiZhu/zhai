 It has been assumed that gelatin consists of a network of an insoluble material enclosing a solution of a more soluble material. The swelling of gelatin is therefore primarily an osmotic phenomena in that the water tends to diffuse in owing to the osmotic pressure of the soluble material. This osmotic pressure is opposed by the elasticity of the insoluble constituent, and equilibrium results when these two pressures are equal. The rate of the entrance of water should then obey Poiseuille's law, provided the variable terms are expressed as functions of the volume. Equations have been derived in this way which agree quite well with the experimental curves and which predict the proper relation between the size and shape of the block and the rate of swelling. They lead to a value for the rate of flow of water through gelatin which has been checked by direct measurement. The mechanism assumed predicts that at a higher temperature and under conditions such that the water has to pass through collodion before reaching the gelatin, the experiment should follow the same course as that of osmosis discussed previously. This was also found to be the case. The slow secondary increase in swelling is ascribed to fatigue of the elastic properties of the gelatin. The rate of this secondary swelling should therefore be independent of the size of the block, in contrast to the rate of primary swelling which is inversely proportional to the size. It can further be shown that this secondary swelling should be proportional to the square root of the time, and also that with large blocks at higher temperatures the entire swelling should be of this secondary type. These predictions have also been found to be true.
