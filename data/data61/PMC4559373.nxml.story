The speed of sight has fascinated scientists and philosophers for centuries. In the blink of an eye, observers can rapidly and effortlessly perform a variety of categorization tasks such as categorizing a scene as open, as natural, or as a beach. The past decade of work has shown that there exist systematic differences in behavioral responses across different categorization tasks: For instance, participants appear to be faster and more accurate at categorizing a scene as outdoor (i.e., superordinate level) compared to categorizing a scene as a beach (i.e., basic level). Here, we describe a computational model combined with human psychophysics experiments, which help shed light on the underlying mechanisms. Using a large natural scene database, we trained machine learning algorithms for different categorization tasks and showed that it is possible to derive confidence measures that accurately predict variations in participants’ behavioral responses across categorization tasks and stimulus sets. Using the computational model to sample stimuli for a human experiment, we demonstrated that it is possible to reverse the superordinate advantage, rendering human observers superordinate categorization slower and less accurate than basic categorization—effectively challenging previous interpretations of the phenomenon. The study further offers a vivid example on how computational models can help summarize and organize existing experimental data as well as plan and interpret new experiments.
