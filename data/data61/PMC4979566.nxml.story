As breast cancer cells often develop chemoresistance, better therapeutic options are in search to circumvent it. Here we demonstrate that human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2)-overexpressing breast cancer cells resist docetaxel-induced cytotoxicity by upregulating HER-2 and its activity downstream, through Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. We observed that introducing resveratrol as a chemosensitizer in docetaxel chemotherapy blocks upregulation and activation of HER-2 in addition to blocking downstream signaling pathways such as Akt. Resveratrol and docetaxel combination results in the synergistic induction of cell death in HER-2-overexpressing SK-BR-3 cells, whereas introduction of wild-type HER-2 in MDA-MD-231 cells increased the resistance to docetaxel. Dominant-negative HER-2 sensitizes SK-BR-3 cells to docetaxel. Our study identified a new synergistic therapeutic combination that targets HER-2-induced breast cancer resistance and might help to overcome therapeutic resistance during breast cancer therapy. The synergism of docetaxel and resveratrol was maximum in SK-BR-3, which is unique among the cell lines studied, due to its high expression status of HER-2, a receptor known to dictate the signaling environment of breast cancer cells. Docetaxel could further induce HER-2 activity in these cells, which was downregulated on resveratrol treatment. Transfection of DN-HER-2 in SK-BR-3 cells inhibits the synergism as the transfection itself sensitizes these cells to docetaxel, leaving no role for resveratrol, whereas ectopic expression of HER-2 introduces the synergism in MDA-MB-231, the triple-negative cell line, in which the synergism was minimum, attesting the crucial role of HER-2 in suppressing the sensitivity to docetaxel. Single-agent docetaxel induced HER-2-mediated resistance to cell death, which was blocked by resveratrol. Resveratrol also downregulated docetaxel-induced activation of MAPK and Akt, survival signaling pathways downstream of HER-2. In short, this study, for the first time, establishes the role of HER-2â€“Akt signaling axis in regulating the synergistic effect of docetaxel and resveratrol in breast cancer cells overexpressing HER-2.
