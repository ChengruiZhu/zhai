In external beam radiotherapy, one of the most common and reliable methods for patient geometrical setup and/or predicting the tumor location is use of external markers. In this study, the main challenging issue is increasing the accuracy of patient setup by investigating external markers location. Since the location of each external marker may yield different patient setup accuracy, it is important to assess different locations of external markers using appropriate selective algorithms. To do this, two commercially available algorithms entitled a) canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and b) principal component analysis (PCA) were proposed as input selection algorithms. They work on the basis of maximum correlation coefficient and minimum variance between given datasets. The proposed input selection algorithms work in combination with an adaptive neuro‐fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) as a correlation model to give patient positioning information as output. Our proposed algorithms provide input file of ANFIS correlation model accurately. The required dataset for this study was prepared by means of a NURBS‐based 4D XCAT anthropomorphic phantom that can model the shape and structure of complex organs in human body along with motion information of dynamic organs. Moreover, a database of four real patients undergoing radiation therapy for lung cancers was utilized in this study for validation of proposed strategy. Final analyzed results demonstrate that input selection algorithms can reasonably select specific external markers from those areas of the thorax region where root mean square error (RMSE) of ANFIS model has minimum values at that given area. It is also found that the selected marker locations lie closely in those areas where surface point motion has a large amplitude and a high correlation.
