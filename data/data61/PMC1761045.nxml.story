Application of molecular phylogenetic methods drastically changed the conception of relationships within mammals. Recent molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that living placental mammals belong to one of the three subgroups: Boreoeutheria, Afrotheria, or Xenarthra, but the relations between these are still unknown. In a previous analysis using 16 genes, Boreoeutheria and Xenarthra grouped together. However, a study based on LINE insertions supported the grouping of Boreoeutheria and Afrotheria. To resolve this discrepancy, we applied sequence data from 1% of a genome in a subset of 18 mammalian species. We used concatenated coding sequence data from 218 genes encompassing 205 kilobases of DNA sequence. Phylogenetic analyses have shown Afrotheria as a basal group of Placentalia with high statistical support. To further validate these results, we analyzed a new phylogenetic marker: conserved noncoding sequence alignments (430 kilobases), which resulted in the same position of the placental root. Topological tests rejected the possibility of Afrotheria-Xenarthra grouping with the coding sequence dataset and Boreoeutheria-Afrotheria grouping with the noncoding sequence dataset. Ascertaining the relationships between mammals is of great importance for the investigation of evolutionary behavior of the different functional genomic elements.
