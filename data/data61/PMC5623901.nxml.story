Human chorionic gonadotropin β (β-hCG) has been implicated in breast tumorigenesis. However, the role of this hormone is highly controversial as certain studies suggest it has anti-tumor properties while others have found it to be pro-tumorigenic. To unveil the truth, we have analyzed the expression of β-hCG in breast cancer. We identified for the first time that β-hCG expression is linked to BRCA1 status and its overexpression is seen in BRCA1 mutated breast cancer cells, BRCA1 conditional knockout mouse breast cancer tissues and BRCA1 floxed basal cell carcinoma (BCC) tissues. An analysis of three large, transcriptomic data sets from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) expression profile confirmed the inverse correlation between BRCA1 and β-hCG in human breast cancer. Using ChIP and luciferase assays, we also demonstrated that the cancer cells with wild-type but not mutant BRCA1 directly repress the expression of β-hCG by binding to its promoter. Further, β-hCG promotes migration and invasion predominantly in BRCA1 mutant breast cancer cells. Interestingly, stable overexpression of β-hCG in BRCA1 mutant but not wild-type breast cancer cells results in the formation of spheres even on monolayer cultures. The cells of these spheres show high expression of both EMT and stem cell markers. Since β-hCG belongs to a cysteine knot family of proteins like TGFβ and TGFβ signaling is deregulated in BRCA1 defective tumors, we checked whether β-hCG can mediate signaling through TGFβRII in BRCA1 mutated cells. We found for the first time that β-hCG can bind and phosphorylate TGFβRII, irrespective of LHCGR status and induce proliferation in BRCA1 defective cells. Our results confirmed that there exists a transcriptional regulation of BRCA1 on β-hCG and BRCA1 mutation promotes β-hCG mediated tumorigenesis through TGFβRII signaling. Thus inhibiting β-hCG-TGFβRII could prove an effective treatment strategy for BRCA1 mutated tumors.
