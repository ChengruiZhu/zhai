The multi-center, randomized, open-label, phase III trial discussed in the present study was performed to compare the clinical outcomes of nedaplatin (NDP) plus paclitaxel, and carboplatin (CBP) plus paclitaxel for the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). In the current study, 182 patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage II–IV EOC were randomly assigned to receive NDP plus paclitaxel or CBP plus paclitaxel at 3-week intervals for a total of six courses. The primary endpoints were progression-free survival rate (PFS) and overall survival rate (OS). The secondary endpoints were toxicity profiles. The median follow-up was 44.63 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 33.67–46.47 months] for the NDP group and 47.63 months (95% CI 45.13–49.07 months) for the CBP group. Overall, there was no significant difference in PFS or OS between the two groups (P=0.09 for PFS, and P=0.65 for OS). For the patients with FIGO stage III–IV EOC, the NDP plus paclitaxel regimen significantly prolonged PFS (P=0.02) but did not result in improved OS (P=0.53) when compared with the CBP group. The patients in the NDP plus paclitaxel group also exhibited a lower incidence rate of grade 3 or 4 leucopenia (P=0.03). Other hematological and non-hematological toxicity profiles were similar between the two groups. Compared with CBP plus paclitaxel regimens, NDP plus paclitaxel regimens achieved comparable survival outcomes and similar toxicity profiles. However, patients of FIGO stage III–IV EOC may experience more clinical benefits from NDP plus paclitaxel treatment, including a prolonged PFS and a lower incidence rate of leucopenia. Therefore, an NDP-based regimen may be an alternative choice when using platinum-based agents to treat EOC.
