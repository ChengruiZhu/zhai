 The curves of growth and of regeneration follow the same course, and can be represented by the same exponential equation. This is taken to substantiate the theory that growth and regeneration are essentially identical processes governed by the same laws. A common peculiarity of the curves of growth and of regeneration is that during a short period in the early stages of regeneration and of growth, the apparent observed speed of these processes seems to be relatively slow. As a result, the curve of the fitted equation cuts the time axis not at zero, the beginning of growth or regeneration, but somewhat later. Data on regeneration are cited indicating that the initial slow phase of regeneration is due to the time required for the formation of a cap of embryonic cells which serves as a basis for the more active later regeneration; in other words, to qualitative growth which cannot be expressed in terms of quantitative units. It is suggested that the apparent initial slow phase of growth of the individual from the fertilized egg is due to a similar qualitative growth. It is suggested that if the initial qualitative changes could be converted into some common unit with the subsequent quantitative changes, the apparent initial lag would disappear, and the exponential equation representing the course of these processes would then be the same as the equation used to represent the course of a monomolecular chemical reaction. Certain implications of this reasoning are discussed in the text.
