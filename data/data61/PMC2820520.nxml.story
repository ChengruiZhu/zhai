Bacteria have evolved various mechanisms for surviving unpredictable changes and stresses in the environment, such as nutrient limitation. One common survival mechanism is the two-component system, where a sensor protein responds to a particular type of stress by activating a regulator in the cell. These regulators can in turn activate genes that produce proteins for stress-appropriate responses. The activated regulator often positively regulates transcription of its own operon containing the sensor and regulator genes leading to a feedback loop. This is interesting, because positive feedback is usually associated with a slower response time than negative feedback and therefore negative feedback would often be selected for by evolution. Here we analyze a mathematical model to study the interplay of this feedback and postranslational mechanisms regulating two-component system signaling. We found that modulation of regulator activity by its operon partner can lead to overall negative feedback to result from autoactivation. This happens if (1) the sensor can both activate and deactivate the regulator, and (2) there is some reaction resulting in regulator activation independently of its cognate sensor. As a result our model predicts that two-component systems may be capable of flexibly switching between positive and negative feedback depending on different circumstances, allowing for appropriate responses in a variety of conditions.
