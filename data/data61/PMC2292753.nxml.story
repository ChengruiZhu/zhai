Homologous recombination promotes genetic diversity in the next generation and serves as a driving force for evolution. It also provides efficient machinery for repairing DNA damage such as double-strand breaks. Homologous recombination involves DNA exchange between homologous chromosomes, which is mediated by evolutionarily conserved proteins called recombinases. It is thought that a recombinase binds to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to form a nucleoprotein filament called the presynaptic filament, and that this higher order structure engages in a search for homologous DNA sequences. Once a homologous duplex is found, the presynaptic filament initiates strand exchange. However, when ssDNA regions are created, they are immediately covered by replication protein A (RPA), thereby inhibiting recombinase filament formation even under conditions in which homologous recombination is appropriate. Previous studies suggested that mediator proteins help load recombinases onto ssDNA, and further studies showed that at least two mediators function together in a single recombination pathway. How these mediators coordinate recombinase loading has been unclear. We have addressed this question by reconstituting an in vitro strand exchange reaction with purified proteins including a fission yeast recombinase, Rhp51, two mediators, Rad22 and the Swi5-Sfr1 complex, and RPA. Our results indicate that Rad22 orchestrates the loading of Rhp51 onto RPA-coated ssDNA by acting as a scaffold for nucleating the recombinase filament, whereas the other mediator, Swi5-Sfr1, stabilizes and activates the filament.
