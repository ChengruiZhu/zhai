Nine patients who had undergone Heart Assist 5 LVAD implantation and had been followed up for more than 30 days were included in this study. Eight patients had ischaemic cardiomyopathy and one had adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy. Pre-implantation data: the mean age of the patients was 52 ± 13 (34–64) years, mean body surface area (BSA) was 1.8 ± 0.2 (1.6–2.0) m2, mean cardiac index (CI) was 2.04 ± 0.4 (1.5–2.6) l/min/m2, mean cardiac output (CO) was 3.7 ± 0.7 (2.6–4.2) l/min, mean ejection fraction (EF) was 23 ± 5 (18–28)%, and right ventricular fractional area contraction (RVFAC) was 43 ± 9 (35–55)%. One patient had aortic valve replacement (AVR) during the LVAD implantation, and excess current alarms and increased power were suspected to be caused by a possible thrombus. Close follow up with TTE studies were carried out to clear the LV of thrombus formation, and the inflow cannula position was checked to maintain the septum in the midline, so preventing the suction cascade. Four patients were followed up for more than two years, and two were followed up for more than a year. Three patients died due to multi-organ failure. Follow-up speed-change TTE studies of six patients showed that the mean speed was 9 800 ± 600 (9 500–10 400) rpm, and mean CO was 4.7 ± 0.3 (4.3– 5.0) l/min during the three-month post-implant period.
