A retrospective review of 982 patients treated for basal cell carcinoma (BCC) was conducted over a period of 8 years from 1996 to 2004. Of these patients, 16 presented a margin involvement. Two cohorts of patients with involved margin were identified: the group whose basal cell carcinoma was re-excised, and the “wait and see” group. Both sets of results obtained were compared, and then matched with recent international literature reviews. Reexcision is our current practice for incompletely excised tumor. However during the period examined only 36 patients of 116 with margin involvement, proceeded to re-excision, and of the remaining 80 patients just 39 were followed-up. The others were missed mainly because of the difficulty of attending follow-up consultations because of advanced age, poor general conditions, and unavailability of transport facilities. On the basis of several points, including a high number of residual tumors detected in the re-excised patients, and difficulty in maintaining diligent follow-up in the “wait and see” group, we stress the importance of considering an early re-excision in case of margin involvement (focal, lateral, or deep), to avoid a significant risk of recurrence. In this study 16 patients out of 39 in the “wait and see” group had recurrences over 8 years of follow-up; a significant number of recurrences was observed after 5 years. We therefore reserve a clinical follow-up only for patients in whom poor general health dissuades us from re-operation.
