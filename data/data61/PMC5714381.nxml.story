Cancer patient mortality is overwhelmingly due to distant organ metastases. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition is a process thought to facilitate local invasion and dissemination of cancer cells, thereby promoting metastasis. The conversion of epithelial cells into mesenchymal, fibroblast-like cells requires profound gene expression changes. A few transcription factors like SNAIL1 can initiate these changes, but are unlikely to be solely responsible for all of them. In our study we asked, whether destabilization of epithelial gene expression programs could involve FOXA transcription factors. FOXA factors represent a special subgroup of regulatory proteins, so-called pioneer factors, with unique roles in the activation of transcriptional enhancers which are key regulatory DNA elements that orchestrate spatio-temporal gene expression. In a model of colorectal cancer we found that SNAIL1 represses FOXA factors, and demonstrate that FOXA factors are associated with enhancer elements at epithelial signature genes. Indeed, FOXA factors are sufficient to initiate enhancer activation and necessary to maintain their activity. Our findings indicate that SNAIL1 induces pervasive repression of epithelial genes through a hierarchical scheme of alterations in transcription factor expression which may be applicable to other instances of cell fate changes and transcriptional reprogramming.
