-terminal kinase (JNK) activation promoted DNA damage response bypass and tumorigenesis in our model of hydrogen peroxide-associated ulcerative colitis (UC) and in patients with quiescent UC (QUC), UC-related dysplasia, and UC-related carcinoma (UC-CRC), thereby adapting to oxidative stress. In the UC model, we have observed features of oncogenic transformation: increased proliferation, undetected DNA damage, and apoptosis resistance. Here, we show that Chk1 was downregulated but activated in the acute and quiescent chronic phases. In both phases, Chk1 was linked to DNA damage response bypass by suppressing JNK activation following oxidative stress, promoting cell cycle progression despite DNA damage. Simultaneously, activated Chk1 was bound to chromatin. This triggered histone acetylation and the binding of histone acetyltransferases and transcription factors to chromatin. Thus, chromatin-immobilized activated Chk1 executed a dual function by suppressing DNA damage response and simultaneously inducing chromatin modulation. This caused undetected DNA damage and increased cellular proliferation through failure to transmit the appropriate DNA damage signal. Findings in vitro were corroborated by chromatin accumulation of activated Chk1, Ac-H3, Ac-H4, and c-Jun in active UC (AUC) in vivo. Targeting chromatin-bound Chk1, GCN5, PCAF, and p300/CBP could be a novel therapeutic strategy to prevent UC-related tumor progression.
