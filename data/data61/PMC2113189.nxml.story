Analyses of the different structural systems of the nucleus and the proteins associated with them pose many problems. Because these systems are largely overlapping, in situ localization studies that preserve the in vivo location of proteins and cellular structures often are not satisfactory. In contrast, biochemical cell fractionation may provide artifactual results due to cross-contamination of extracts and structures. To overcome these problems, we have developed a method that combines biochemical cell fractionation and in situ localization and leads to the preparation of a residual cellular skeleton (nuclear matrix and cytoskeletal elements) from cultured cells. This method's main feature is that cell fractionation is performed in situ. Therefore, structures not solubilized in a particular extraction step remain attached to the substrate and retain their morphology. Before and after each extraction step they can be analyzed for the presence and location of the protein under study by using immunological or cytochemical techniques. Thereby the in vivo origin of a protein solubilized in a particular extraction step is determined. The solubilized protein then may be further characterized biochemically. In addition, to allow analyses of proteins associated with the residual cellular skeleton, we have developed conditions for its solubilization that do not interfere with enzymatic and immunological studies.
