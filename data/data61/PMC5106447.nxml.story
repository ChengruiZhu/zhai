Research results on 3D modeling of the diamond grain and its bearing layer when sintering diamond grinding wheels are provided in this paper. The influence of the main characteristics of the wheel materials and the wheel production process, namely the quantity of metallic phase within diamond grain, coefficient of thermal expansion of the metallic phase, the modulus of elasticity of bond material and sintering temperature, on the internal stresses arising in grains is investigated. The results indicate that the stresses in the grains are higher in the areas around the metallic phase. Additionally, sintering temperature has the greatest impact on the stresses of the grain-metallic phase-bond system regardless of the type of the bond. Furthermore, by employing factorial design for the carried out finite element model, a mathematical model that reflects the impact of these factors on the deflected mode of the diamond grain-metallic phase-bond material system is obtained. The results of the analysis allow for the identification of optimal conditions for the efficient production of improved diamond grinding wheels. More specifically, the smallest stresses are observed when using the metal bond with modulus of elasticity 204 GPa, the quantity of metallic phase in diamond grain of not higher than 7% and coefficient of thermal expansion of 1.32 × 10
