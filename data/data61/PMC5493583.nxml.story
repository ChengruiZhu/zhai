Autoimmune liver diseases are conditions of low prevalence that comprise the triad of autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis (cirrhosis) and primary sclerosing cholangitis and their poorly characterised overlapping syndromes. Diagnostic autoantibodies are associated with autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cholangitis but not with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Autoantibodies are useful disease markers that facilitate early diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cholangitis and allow for therapeutic intervention to prevent progression to liver cirrhosis and associated complications. Adult onset type 1 autoimmune hepatitis is associated with F-actin reactive smooth muscle autoantibody, antinuclear autoantibody in 60% of patients, and autoantibody to SLA/LP in 15â€“20%. Juvenile onset type 2 autoimmune hepatitis is associated with LKM-1 and LC-1 autoantibodies. Primary biliary cholangitis is associated with a mitochondria-associated autoantibody designated M2 in >90% of patients and with disease-specific antinuclear autoantibodies in 50% that bind to antigens in the nuclear core complex and in multiple nuclear dots. Autoantibodies to the nuclear core complex target gp210, nucleoporin p62 and nuclear lamin B receptor. Autoantibodies to multiple nuclear dots target Sp100 and PML antigens. Liver autoantibodies in asymptomatic patients with normal liver function may precede the subsequent development of overt autoimmune liver disease. For routine diagnostic immunology laboratories, initial screening for liver autoantibodies by immunofluorescence remains the method of choice with confirmation for reactivity with their target antigen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or line blot when required.
