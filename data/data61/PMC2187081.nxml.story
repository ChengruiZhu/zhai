Monocyte-specific monoclonal antibodies (7) were used to compare the efficacy of monocytes and dendritic cells as accessory or stimulator cells for human T cell replication. Both unfractionated and plastic- adherent mononuclear cells were first treated with a cytolytic antimonocyte antibody that kills greater than 95% of monocytes but not dendritic cells. When tested as stimulators of the mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR) and of oxidative mitogenesis (the proliferation of T cells modified with sodium periodate), the monocyte-depleted cells had normal or enhanced stimulatory capacity. Monocyte-depleted mononuclear cells also proliferated normally to soluble antigens (Candida albicans, tetanus toxoid), even under limiting conditions of cell dose, antigen dose, and culture time. Adherent blood mononuclear cells were next separated into monocyte-enriched and -depleted components using fluoresceinated antimonocyte antibody and the cell sorter. The depleted fraction (less than 2% monocytes by esterase staining and by cytology) contained the dendritic cells and exhibited at least 75% of the accessory activity. The monocyte-rich fraction (approximately 97% esterase positive) stimulated the MLR and oxidative mitogenesis weakly, and was comparable in potency to nonadherent cells. Cell-specific antibodies and complement were also used to prepare dendritic cells that were thoroughly depleted of monocytes and lymphocytes. The dendritic cells (70-80% pure) were potent stimulators of the allogeneic MLR, syngeneic MLR, and tetanus toxoid response, being active at stimulator to responder ratios of 1:100 or less. Taken together with previous studies (1, 2), these experiments indicate that the dendritic cell is the major stimulator of T cell replication in man. The contribution of class II products of the major histocompatibility complex (7) was then evaluated with a new monoclonal, 9.3F10. Accessory function was dramatically inhibited if cells bearing class II antigens were killed with 9.3F10 and complement, or if class II molecules were blocked by the addition of 9.3F10 Fab to the culture medium. The expression of 9.3F10 class II products was therefore studied on purified monocytes and dendritic cells. Most if not all cells in both populations reacted with 9.3F10, and each population exhibited approximately 150,000 125I-Fab 9.3F10 binding sites per cell. Since Ia+ dendritic cells are active accessory cells, but Ia+ monocytes are not, class II products are necessary but not sufficient for the stimulation of T cell proliferation in man.
