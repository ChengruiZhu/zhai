The treatment of advanced-stage oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma may utilize various modes, including combining surgery with chemoradiotherapy (CTRT), or primary CTRT followed by rescue surgery. In previous literature it has been revealed how patients treated with combined modes report a low quality of life (QoL) and severe consequences following surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, in the short and in the long-term. The decrease in the QoL of patients treated with high-intensity multi-modal strategies highlights the necessity of modifying treatments, particularly for young HPV-positive patients, where an increased survival rate has already been reported. The modified treatment for HPV-positive tumors in the tonsils and at the base of the tongue is based on the deintensification of therapies aiming to reduce toxicity and thereby improve QoL in the long term, whilst still maintaining therapeutic effectiveness. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the QoL in patients with a long-term survival, who were treated with combined therapy for squamous cell tumors in the tonsils and at the base of the tongue, and to compare the results observed in HPV-positive and HPV-negative patients. According to statistical analysis, differences in the general QoL and in the single scales of the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer questionnaires were not correlated with the type of therapy selected for the particular patient. QoL considered the presence of HPV, the type of treatment, the subregion of the tonsils vs. the base of the tongue and the disease stage at the time of diagnosis, and was determined to be non-influential with regard to these specific variables.
