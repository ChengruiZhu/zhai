To explore the effects of LYRM1 knockdown on proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation and mitochondrial function in the embryonic carcinoma (P19) cell model of cardiac differentiation. Knockdown of LYRM1 using small interfering RNA (siRNA) was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Cell Counting Kit-8(CCK-8) proliferation assays and cell cycle analysis demonstrated that LYRM1 gene silencing significantly inhibited P19 cell proliferation. Flow cytometry and measurement of their caspase-3 activities revealed that knockdown of LYRM1 increased P19 cell apoptosis. Observation of morphological changes using an inverted microscope and expression analysis of specific differentiation marker genes using quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting revealed that knockdown of LYRM1 significantly inhibited the differentiation of P19 cells into cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, real-time quantitative PCR applied to detect mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number implied that there was no significant difference in the LYRM1 knockdown group compared with the control group. Cellular ATP production investigated by luciferase-based luminescence assay was dramatically decreased in differentiated cells transfected with LYRM1 RNAi. Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometery were used to detect the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) showed that the level of ROS was dramatically increased and MMP was obviously decreased in differentiated cells transfected with LYRM1 RNAi. Collectively, knockdown of LYRM1 promoted apoptosis and suppressed proliferation and differentiation in P19 cells. In addition, knockdown of LYRM1 induced mitochondrial impairment in P19 cells during differentiation, which was reflected by decreased ATP synthesis, lower MMP and increased ROS levels.
