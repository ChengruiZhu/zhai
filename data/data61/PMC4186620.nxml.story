Worldwide, the incidence and mortality rates of childhood cancers differ. The study of incidence patterns and survival rates in childhood malignancies is important in aiding in the planning of treatment centers and in obtaining further information with regard to the etiology. Few studies have investigated the survival in cases of childhood solid tumors in Egypt. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the patterns, frequency and outcome of solid tumors and lymphomas in children admitted to and followed up at the Pediatric Oncology Department of Zagazig University Hospital (Zagazig, Egypt) over a duration of 5 years (January 2004 to December 2008). A retrospective study was conducted, which included 155 children with solid tumors and lymphomas. The medical records were reviewed and the relevant data collected, in particular, those concerning demographic, clinical, histopathological, laboratory and imaging data as well as the treatment plans and outcomes. The mean age of patients was 5.6±3.04 years at diagnosis. The patients comprised 94 males and 61 females. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) was the most common tumor type, followed by neuroblastoma (31.0 and 29.0%, respectively). When patients were stratified in terms of age (<5, ≥5 but <10, and ≥10 years), the <5-years-of-age group exhibited the greatest number of patients. Fever, pallor and pain were the most frequent initial clinical presentations among the patients and stage II was the most common stage (39.1%) followed by stage IV, III and I (35.0, 20.3 and 5.6% respectively). The overall 5-year survival rate in the study group was 66.7%. The survival rate was significantly higher in patients with Wilm’s tumor and Hodgkin lymphoma, followed by NHL (92.0, 88.0 and 72.0%, respectively; P<0.001), while the mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with neuroblastoma (P<0.001). In conclusion, NHL and neuroblastoma were the most common tumors; the survival rates were higher in patients with Wilm’s tumor and Hodgkin lymphoma and lower in patients with neuroblastoma. A larger multicenter study is required to further investigate the conclusions drawn from this study.
