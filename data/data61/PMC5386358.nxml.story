Although precisely controlled lipolysis is crucial for maintaining physiological levels of circulating free fatty acids in response to energetic stress, the underlying mechanisms by which this process is governed remain poorly understood. Survivin is a gene that has been found to be highly expressed in the most common human tumors, and it is considered to be associated with tumorigenesis. Survivin expression in normal tissue is developmentally downregulated and is undetectable in most terminally differentiated adult tissues. Here, we report that Survivin expression in mature adipocytes from murine white adipose tissue can be highly induced under high-fat diet feeding conditions. During the adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and mesenchymal C3H10T1/2 cells, Survivin expression is gradually decreased and almost undetectable in fully differentiated adipocytes. However, it can be expressed again upon insulin exposure, through the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway. Nevertheless, Survivin overexpression is sensitive to nutritional deprivation, and expression markedly decreases in response to starvation with Hank's buffered salt solution challenge. The ectopic expression of Survivin downregulates expression of Adrb3 and then decreases the production of cAMP, while Fsp27 protein levels are upregulated as a result of reduced protein degradation. This in turn inhibits isoproterenol-stimulated adipocyte lipolysis. Survivin also attenuates DNA damage related to PARP activation and inhibits TNF
