MicroRNAs are a novel class of genes that encodes for short RNA molecules recognized to play key roles in the regulation of many biological networks. MicroRNAs, predicted to collectively target more than 30% of all human protein-coding genes, suppress gene expression by binding to regulatory elements usually embedded in the 3′-UTRs of their target mRNAs. Despite intensive efforts in recent years, biological functions carried out by microRNAs have been characterized for only a small number of these genes, making elucidation of their roles one of the greatest challenges of biology today. Bioinformatics analyses can significantly help meet this challenge. In particular, the integrated analysis of microarray mRNA expression data and 3′-UTR sequences holds great promise for systematic dissection of regulatory networks controlled by microRNAs. Applying such integrated analysis to numerous microarray datasets, we disclosed a major technical bias that hampers the identification of active microRNAs from mRNA expression profiles. We developed visualization and normalization schemes for detection and removal of the bias and demonstrate that their application to microarray data significantly enhances the identification of active microRNAs. Given the broad use of microarrays and the ever-growing interest in microRNAs, we anticipate that the methods we introduced will be widely adopted.
