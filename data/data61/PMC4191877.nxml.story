Cell membranes consist of a variety of lipids and proteins with inhomogeneous lateral distribution, forming domains with distinct composition and properties. These domains play a fundamental role in a number of biological processes, and perturbing them can have important effects on cellular functions. Some chemicals with high affinity for lipid membranes perturb membrane domains, but the link between properties of the chemicals and domain perturbation is not understood. The mechanisms of domain perturbation are also not understood. In the present work we use molecular simulations of model membranes to understand the driving forces and the mechanisms of domain perturbation by different chemicals. We explore the effect of six hydrophobic compounds, all of them rather simple and common but with different size, shape, and properties. We find that all hydrophobic compounds alter the stability of domains, but not all of them in the same way. We identify two groups of compounds with opposite effects: aromatic compounds stabilize domains, while aliphatic compounds destabilize them. Simulations also allow us to visualize, for the first time, the mechanism of domain perturbation â€“ which is very difficult to assess experimentally. Our findings on model membranes suggest possible mechanisms of action for hydrophobic chemicals in living cells.
