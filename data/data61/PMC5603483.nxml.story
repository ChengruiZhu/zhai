Interleukin (IL)-17 plays an important role in rhinitis and the level thereof correlates with the severity of disease. However, no mouse model for IL-17-dominant rhinitis has yet been developed. Our objective was to establish a mouse model of IL-17-dominant rhinitis via intranasal application of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (abbreviated as Poly(I:C)). Mice were divided into 6 groups (n=8 for each group); 1) 1 negative control group, 2) 1 positive control group (OVA/alum model), 3) 2 Poly(I:C) groups (10 or 100 µg), and 4) 2 OVA/Poly(I:C) groups (10 or 100 µg). The positive control group was treated with the conventional OVA/alum protocol. In the Poly(I:C) and OVA/Poly(I:C) groups, phosphate-buffered saline or an OVA solution plus Poly(I:C) were administered. The OVA/Poly(I:C) groups exhibited significantly greater neutrophil infiltration and increased IL-17/interferon γ expression compared with the other groups. However, the levels of total immunoglobulin E (IgE), OVA-specific IgE, eosinophil infiltration, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10 were significantly lower in the OVA/Poly(I:C) groups than in mice subjected to conventional Th2-dominant OVA/alum treatment (the positive control group). IL-17 and neutrophil measurement, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 immunohistochemistry, and confocal microscopy revealed increased numbers of IL-17-secreting cells in the nasal mucosa of the OVA/Poly(I:C) groups, which included natural killer cells, CD4 T cells, and neutrophils. In conclusion, we developed a mouse model of IL-17-dominant rhinitis using OVA together with Poly(I:C). This model will be useful in research on neutrophil- or IL-17-dominant rhinitis.
