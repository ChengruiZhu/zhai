In order to estimate the effects of small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting retinoblastoma binding protein 2 (RBP2) on the proliferation, expression, invasion, migration and tumorigenicity abilities of papillary thyroid carcinoma K1 cells, siRNA targeting RBP2 (RBP2-siRNA) and negative control siRNA were transfected into K1 cells. The mRNA levels of RBP2 in the transfected cells were estimated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and the protein levels of RBP2 in these cells were evaluated by western blot analysis and immunocytochemical (ICC) analyses. The growth, tumorigenicity, migration and invasion abilities of the transfected cells were measured by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), soft agar colony formation and transwell chamber assay, respectively. The ICC results demonstrated that the protein expression levels of RBP2 were lower in the RBP2-siRNA-transfected cells than in the blank and control cells (analysis of variance, F=26.754, P<0.01). RBP2-siRNA downregulated RBP2 at the mRNA (t=8.869) and protein level (F=60.835) (P=0.000 vs. control cells). In addition, the transfection of RBP2-siRNA into K1 cells also suppressed cell proliferation at 24, 48 and 72 h post-transfection (t=7.650, P<0.01; t=2.606, P=0.016; and t=2.377, P=0.027, respectively). Compared with the control group, the number of invasive and migrated cells were significantly reduced in the RBP2-siRNA-transfected group (t=4.774 and t=6.366, respectively; P<0.01). Furthermore, the tumorigenic potential of the cells transfected with RBP2-siRNA was markedly reduced, as indicated by the soft agar formation assay (t=2.749, P=0.014 vs. control cells). In conclusion, the transfection of RBP2-siRNA into papillary thyroid carcinoma K1 cells suppressed the expression of RBP2 in these cells, and reduced their proliferation, invasion, migration and tumorigenic potential. Therefore, targeting RBP2 may be an efficient approach to control thyroid carcinoma.
