Type 2 diabetic patients are insulin resistant as a result of obesity and a sedentary lifestyle. Nevertheless, it has been known for the past five decades that insulin response to nutrients is markedly diminished in type 2 diabetes. There is now a consensus that impaired glucose regulation cannot develop without insulin deficiency. First‐phase insulin response to glucose is lost very early in the development of type 2 diabetes. Several prospective studies have shown that impaired insulin response to glucose is a predictor of future impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and type 2 diabetes. Recently discovered type 2 diabetes‐risk gene variants influence β‐cell function, and might represent the molecular basis for the low insulin secretion that predicts future type 2 diabetes. We believe type 2 diabetes develops on the basis of normal but ‘weak’β‐cells unable to cope with excessive functional demands imposed by overnutrition and insulin resistance. Several laboratories have shown a reduction in β‐cell mass in type 2 diabetes and IGT, whereas others have found modest reductions and most importantly, a large overlap between β‐cell masses of diabetic and normoglycemic subjects. Therefore, at least initially, the β‐cell dysfunction of type 2 diabetes seems more functional than structural. However, type 2 diabetes is a progressive disorder, and animal models of diabetes show β‐cell apoptosis with prolonged hyperglycemia/hyperlipemia (glucolipotoxicity). β‐Cells exposed
