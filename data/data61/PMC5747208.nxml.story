Despite the evolution of runner performance in athletes with cerebral palsy (CP), little is known about neuromuscular parameters of sprinters from different classes, especially related to power output, muscular imbalances and asymmetry indexes in lower limbs. The aim of this study was to assess muscle power, muscular imbalance and asymmetry in sprinters with CP. Four male sprinters with CP (age, 18 to 27 years; body mass, 58.5 to 72.8 kg; height, 161.5 to 174 cm) classified as T38, T37, T36, T35 according to International Paralympic Committee functional classification, performed vertical counter movement jump and squat jump on force plate and isokinetic torque evaluations in both limbs. The concentric peak torque (PT) was measured at 60°/sec, 120°/sec and 180°/sec and PT eccentric at 60°/sec and 120°/sec. The asymmetry indexes, conventional and functional ratios were assessed. the results showed that athletes with more severe impairments (T35 and T36) showed worse performance to muscle power, more muscular imbalance and higher asymmetry in PT between limbs (> 10%). The exception was T37 athlete, who presented the better performance for all variables. it is concluded that CP athletes with more severe impairments showed lower jumping performance and torque production of knee extensors and flexors, they showed greater asymmetries between limbs. Finally, considering the results of T37 athlete, it seems that the athletic training for a longer period can reverse part of the neuromuscular impairments caused by CP.
