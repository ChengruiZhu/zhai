A total of 134 subjects met inclusion criteria. Progression of patellofemoral articular cartilage damage between primary and revision surgery was noted in 31 of the 134 patients (23.1%). Median age at time of revision was 19.5 years [IQ range 17-25 years] and median time from primary to revision was 15.2 months [IQ range 9.6-34.4 months]. The use of allograft for the primary reconstruction, increased BMI, and increased time from primary to revision surgery were associated with increased risk of progression of articular cartilage damage in the patellofemoral joint. The use of allograft was associated with a 15-fold increased odds of progression of articular cartilage damage relative to a patellar tendon autograft (OR = 15.5, 95% CI = 3.2-75.3, p = 0.001). The use of a hamstring autograft was not associated with significantly increased odds of progression relative to patellar tendon autograft (OR = 4.3, 95% CI = 0.8-22.4, p = 0.08) Each one unit increase in BMI at the time of revision surgery was associated with a 10% increased in the odds of progression of articular cartilage damage (OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.00-1.22, p = 0.046). Each one month increase in time from primary to revision surgery was associated with a 2% increased in the odds of progression of articular cartilage damage (OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 1.00-1.04, p = 0.047). No other potential predictors were associated with increased odds of progression, including age, activity level prior to revision surgery, and meniscus status at primary reconstruction.
