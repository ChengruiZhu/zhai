Gating currents (Ig) were recorded in single canine cardiac Purkinje cells at 10-12 degrees C. Ig characteristics corresponded closely to macroscopic INa characteristics and appeared to exhibit little contamination from other voltage-gated channels. Charge density predicted by peak INa was 0.14-0.22 fC micron -2 and this compared well with the measured value of 0.19 +/- 0.10 fC micron -2 (SD; n = 28). The charge-voltage relationship rose over a voltage similar to the peak INa conductance curve. The midpoints of the two relationships were not significantly different although the conductance curve was 1.5 +/- 0.3 (SD; n = 9) times steeper. Consistent with this observation, which predicted that a large amount of the gating charge would be associated with transitions close to the open state, an analysis of activation from Hodgkin-Huxley fits to the macroscopic currents showed that tau m corresponded well with a prominent component of Ig. Ig relaxations fitted two exponentials better than one over the range of voltages in which Na channels were activated. When the holding potential was hyperpolarized, relaxation of Ig during step depolarizations to 0 mV was prolonged but there was no substantial increase in charge, further suggesting that early closed-state transitions are less in charge, further suggesting that early closed-state transitions are less voltage dependent. The single cardiac Purkinje cell appears to be a good candidate for combining Ig and single-channel measurements to obtain a kinetic description of the cardiac Na channel.
