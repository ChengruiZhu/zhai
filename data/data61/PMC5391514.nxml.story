The aim of our review is to identify the reconstruction technique that has a superior functional outcome and decreased number of complications for the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). We have divided our review into 2 sections. Our primary question evaluates the functional results and complications of autografts compared to allografts for ACL reconstruction. Our subsidiary question evaluates the functional results and complications of bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autografts compared to hamstring tendon autografts. We conducted a systematic review (SR) based on high quality evidence provided by Cochrane, PubMed and National Health Service evidence searches for papers comparing different ACL reconstruction techniques. Results from 2 primary studies, 1 SR and 1 meta-analysis showed no significant statistical difference when comparing clinical outcomes such as pain, range of motion, laxity, International Knee Documentation Committee score, single assessment numerical evaluation score, Tegner activity score and patient reported satisfaction with regards to autografts  allografts. Allografts had worse outcomes for postoperative tibial tunnelling and graft failure. Results of 3 SRs showed statistically significant differences in incidence of anterior knee pain, kneeling pain and knee stability, which were all found to be greater amongst those who had received a BPTB autograft. Knee extension was significantly reduced in patients with BPTB grafts when compared to patients with Hamstring tendon autografts. However, with regards to return to prior levels of activity, there was no statistically significant difference between those that received BPTB autografts and those that received Hamstring tendon autografts. Autograft reconstruction of the ACL was shown to provide better postoperative outcomes when compared to allograft reconstruction, although the difference was not statistically significant. When researching different autograft options BPTB autografts were associated with greater pain but also greater stability of the knee joint postoperatively when compared to hamstring tendon autografts.
