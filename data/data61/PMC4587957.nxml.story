In this study, using the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and Cancer Genome Project (CGP) studies as benchmark datasets, we explored the application of similarity information between cell lines and drugs in drug response prediction. We found that similar cell lines by gene expression profiles exhibit similar response to the same drug. Meanwhile, drugs with similar chemical structures also show similar inhibitory effects across different cell lines. Based on the above observations, we proposed a dual-layer network and local weighted model to predict drug response of a cell line using proximal information of the drug-cell line network. The only three parameters of our model are optimized by leave-one-out cross-validation for each drug. Two case studies of MAPK and ERK signal pathways on CCLE dataset proved that the predicted-to-observed correlations of our dual-layer network model is significantly better than the previous predictor using elastic net model. Interestingly, predictions based on drug similarity network (DSN) alone were much better than those based on cell line similarity network (CSN) alone for most drugs, implying that drug similarities are more informative for drug response prediction than cell line similarities. Our network model can be applied to predict the response of a new cell line to existing already tested drugs or to predict the response of an existing cell line to new drugs, thus potentially saving the cost in a drug-cell line screening.
