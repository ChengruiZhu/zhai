Long-term cultures of murine fetal liver have been successfully established using a modification of our in vitro bone marrow culture system (14, 15). Fetal liver cells from midgestation BALB/c embryos were plated onto BAB-14 bone marrow stromal cell-adherent layers. After a 3-5 wk period, cell growth began to increase and these cells were expanded in number on fresh feeder layers. The cultured fetal liver cells were lymphoid in morphology, 5-20% cytoplasmic Ig-positive, but less than 1% surface Ig-positive. Southern blot analysis of the cultured fetal liver cells, as well as cultured bone marrow-derived B cells, demonstrated a population with germline Ig heavy chain loci, possibly representing very early B cell precursors. Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) clonal transformants of such cultured fetal liver cells had a phenotypic distribution similar to that seen with fresh fetal liver transformants but distinct from those obtained with the transformation of either cultured or fresh bone marrow. All A-MuLV transformants isolated had rearrangements at the mu heavy chain locus of both chromosomes, irrespective of Ig production. In addition, most mu heavy chain producers had at least one rearranged kappa gene locus. These long-term fetal liver cultures provide large numbers of cells for studying events early in the B lymphocyte lineage. The cultured fetal liver cells retained phenotypic traits similar to fresh fetal liver B cells and distinctive from bone marrow cells cultured under similar conditions.
