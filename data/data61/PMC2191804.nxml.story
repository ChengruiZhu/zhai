The murine Ly-49 antigen belongs to a family of type II transmembrane molecules containing lectin-like domains. The original member of this family, Ly-49A, has been demonstrated to be expressed by a subpopulation of natural killer (NK) cells, bind certain class I major histocompatibility complexes (MHC), and act as a negative regulator of lytic activity. The expression patterns and functional activities of the other Ly-49s, however, is unknown. We extended the study of this family by isolating cDNAs encoding two new Ly-49 molecules. The reactivity of these and previously identified Ly-49 molecules with NK antibodies was tested in a COS cell expression system. YE1/32 and YE1/48 bound Ly-49A specifically, and 5E6 reacted only with Ly-49C. Three-color flow cytometric analysis demonstrated Ly-49A and Ly-49C expression defines complex, but distinct subsets within NK1.1+ cells. Some NK1.1-CD3+ as well as NK1.1-CD3- cells expressing Ly-49A or C were also detected. Analysis of MHC congenic strains of mice demonstrated that YE1/32+ and YE1/48+ NK cells are not deleted, as has been shown with the Ly-49A mAb A1. Furthermore, COS cells transfected with Ly-49A bound H-2d and H-2k cell lines, whereas Ly-49C transfectants bound H- 2d, H-2k, H-2b, and H-2s. The antibodies 5E6 and 34-1-2S (anti-class I MHC) inhibited the binding of Ly-49C to an H-2s cell line. These results imply that the NK cell antigens Ly-49A and C bind to different repertoires of class I MHC molecules.
