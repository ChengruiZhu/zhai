A number of instantaneous changes occurred when picrate was added to a suspension of human red cells in steady state with respect to glycolysis and ion distribution across the membrane at pH 7.40. The rate of glycolysis increased, without change in glycolytic quotient, to a new steady-state value, the effect reaching a maximum of 1.75 times the rate of the control at 0.5 mM picrate. Inorganic phosphate (P(i)) was released at a relatively constant rate, increasing with picrate concentration to 1.0 mmol P(i)/liter cells x h at 5-6 mM picrate. The steady- state concentrations of ATP and 1,3-diphosphoglycerate (1,3-DPG) decreased to new stable values within 15-45 min after the addition of picrate. The ATP level was affected only at picrate concentrations of 1 mM or more, and the level of ATP stabilized at 75 percent of the control values at 4 mM of picrate. In contrast, 1,3-DPG concentrations decreased to 40 percent of the control value of 0.5 mM picrate. Higher concentrations of picrate resulted in only a small additional decrease in the stationary concentration of 1,3-DGP. A net efflux of cellular potassium at constant rate took place. This net efflux was an almost linear function of picrate concentration in the range of 0.1-3 mM. At the latter concentration the net efflux amounted to about 2.7 meq/liter cells x h and a further increase in picrate concentration caused only a minor increase in the potassium efflux. Possible mechanisms for the effects of picrate on human red cell glycolysis are discussed.
