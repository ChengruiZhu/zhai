A dual-antigen, dual-isotope assay has been used to monitor the migratory behavior of selectively labeled antiallogeneic lymphocytes in mice challenged subcutaneously in all four foot pads with semiallogeneic spleen cells. 3H-labeled anti-C3H and 14C-labeled anti- C57BL lymphocytes of DBA/2J origin were pooled and adoptively transferred to multiple groups of previously challenged DBA/2J recipients. In some of the studies, separate groups of recipients were challenged with either CDF or BDF spleen cells in all four paws, whereas in others CDF spleen cells were used to challenge the right paws of each mouse in the group and BDF spleen cells to challenge the left paws of each mouse in the group. At intervals varying from 24 to 96 h after challenge, a subgroup of four mice from each appropriate group was sacrificed and the relative numbers of anti-C3H and anti- C57BL lymphocytes present in the challenged paws, draining lymph nodes, and other tissues of each mouse were inferred from the mean 3H/14C ratios of the respective tissues of that subgroup. The results of these studies firmly establish that specific antiallogeneic lymphocytes are selectively recruited to the paws and draining lymph nodes of mice challenged subcutaneously in the foot pads with semiallogeneic spleen cells and are deleted from their circulating blood and nondraining lymph nodes. A mechanism for antigen-induced selective recruitment and its possible functional significance in tumor immunology are discussed.
