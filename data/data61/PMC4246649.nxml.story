 or Fisherâ€™s exact tests. The mean patient age at the time of presentation was 53 years. A total of 24 EGISTs were detected, originating in the omentum (n=4), mesentery (n=19) and retroperitoneum (n=1), respectively. The EGISTs displayed a predominantly spindle cell subtype (87.5%; 21/24). The majority of the EGISTs appeared as large (>10 cm; 70.8%; 17/24), round or oval (66.7%; 16/24), cystic-solid (87.5%; 21/24) and ill-defined (66.7%; 16/24) soft-tissue masses. The EGISTs were hypodense (69.6%; 16/23) or isodense (30.4%; 7/23) on CT images, hypointense (50%; 3/6), isointense (33.3%; 2/6) or hyperintense (16.7%; 1/6) on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), and hyperintense on T2WI (100%; 6/6) and diffusion-WI (DWI; 100%; 6/6). A total of 54.2% (13/24) of the EGISTs displayed tumor vessels. Overall, 95.8% (23/24) of the masses showed marked enhancement and 87.5% (21/24) demonstrated heterogeneous enhancement. Calcification, hemorrhage, ascites and lymphadenopathy were rare characteristics in the EGISTs. Distant metastases were present in 10 patients (41.7%). The size, borders, tumor vessels and distant metastasis correlated with high-grade EGISTs [>5 mitoses/50 high-power fields (HPFs)] (P<0.05). The results of the present study indicated that clinical and radiological features, including advanced age, a large tumor size, cystic-necrotic components, rare lymphadenopathy, a heterogeneous enhancement pattern and hepatic metastasis may aid in the diagnosis of EGISTs. Radiological characteristics, such as a large size (>10 cm), ill-defined borders, tumor vessels and distant metastasis, can provide useful information in identifying the malignant behavior of EGISTs.
