Tyrosine kinase activity is known to be important in neuronal growth cone guidance. However, underlying cellular mechanisms are largely unclear. Here, we report how Src family tyrosine kinase activity controls apCAM-mediated growth cone steering by regulating the transmission of traction forces through receptor–cytoskeletal linkages. Increased levels of tyrosine phosphorylation were detected at sites where beads coated with apCAM ligands were physically restrained to induce growth cone steering, but not at unrestrained bead binding sites. Interestingly, the rate and level of phosphotyrosine buildup near restrained beads were decreased by the myosin inhibitor 2,3-butanedione-2-monoxime, suggesting that tension promotes tyrosine kinase activation. While not affecting retrograde F-actin flow rates, genistein and the Src family selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors PP1 and PP2 strongly reduced the growth cone's ability to apply traction forces through apCAM–cytoskeletal linkages, assessed using the restrained bead interaction assay. Furthermore, increased levels of an activated Src family kinase were detected at restrained bead sites during growth cone steering events. Our results suggest a mechanism by which growth cones select pathways by sampling both the molecular nature of the substrate and its ability to withstand the application of traction forces.
