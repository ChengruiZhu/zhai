We have previously shown that the neural adhesion molecules L1 and NCAM interact with each other to form a complex which binds more avidly to L1 than L1 to L1 alone (Kadmon, G., A. Kowitz, P. Altevogt, and M. Schachner. 1990a. J. Cell Biol. 110:193-208). This cis-association between L1 and NCAM is carbohydrate-dependent (Kadmon, G., A. Kowitz, P. Altevogt, and M. Schachner. 1990b. J. Cell Biol. 110:209-218). In the present study, we report that L1 and NCAM bind to each other via oligomannosidic carbohydrates expressed by L1, but not by NCAM, as shown in several experiments: (a) complex formation between L1 and NCAM is inhibited by a mAb to oligomannosidic carbohydrates and by the oligosaccharides themselves; (b) NCAM binds to oligomannosidic carbohydrates; (c) within the L1/NCAM complex, the oligomannosidic carbohydrates are hidden from accessibility to a mAb against oligomannosidic carbohydrates; (d) the recombinant protein fragment of NCAM containing the immunoglobulin-like domains and not the fragment containing the fibronectin type III homologous repeats binds to oligomannosidic glycans. Furthermore, the fourth immunoglobulin-like domain of NCAM shows sequence homology with carbohydrate recognition domains of animal C-type lectins and, surprisingly, also with plant lectins. A peptide comprising part of the C-type lectin consensus sequence in the fourth immunoglobulin-like domain of NCAM interferes with the association between L1 and NCAM. The functional importance of oligomannosidic glycans at the cell surface was shown for neurite outgrowth in vitro. When neurons from early postnatal mouse cerebellum were maintained on laminin or poly-L-lysine, neurite outgrowth was inhibited by oligomannosidic glycans, by glycopeptides, glycoproteins, or neoglycolipids containing oligomannosidic glycans, but not by nonrelated oligosaccharides or oligosaccharide derivates. Neurite outgrowth was also inhibited by the peptide comprising part of the C- type lectin consensus sequence in the fourth immunoglobulin-like domain of NCAM. The combined results suggest that carbohydrate-mediated cis- associations between adhesion molecules at the cell surface modulate their functional properties.
