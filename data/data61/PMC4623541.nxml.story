There are numerous treatment algorithms that have been developed to treat thumb carpometacarpal (CMC) arthritis. A newer treatment option for these patients is CMC stabilization using suture button suspensionplasty. The authors of this case report have extensive experience with the suture-button suspensionplasty using the Mini TightRope CMC technique (Arthrex). We present a novel usage of the suture-button suspensionplasty to reconstruct the dorsal ulnar ligament (in contrast to the usual reconstruction of the volar beak ligament) to treat a patient with persistent thumb metacarpal dislocation at the CMC joint. Two separate patients are presented. One patient demonstrates volar beak ligament instability, and the other demonstrates dorsal ulnar ligament instability. Both patientsâ€™ demographics and operative indications are described. The operative technique for the novel usage of the suture-button suspensionplasty is described. Operative results of the dorsal ulnar ligament reconstruction are reviewed. After suture-button suspension of the thumb metacarpal to the trapezium, the dorsal ulnar ligament has been reconstructed. The patient demonstrated stability of the thumb CMC joint without dorsal or radial dislocation. The authors of this case report present a novel usage of the suture-button suspensionplasty to treat a patient with proximal thumb metacarpal dislocation at the trapezial-metacarpal interface. This method, in contrast to the referenced method of volar beak ligament reconstruction, allows reconstruction of the dorsal ulnar ligament. This allows stabilization of the joint by preventing dorsal and radial dislocation of the metacarpal.
