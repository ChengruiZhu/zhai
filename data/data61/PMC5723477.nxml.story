The Varian 120 multileaf collimator (MLC) has a leaf thickness of 5 mm projected at the isocenter plane and can deliver a radiation beam of large field size (up to 30 cm) to be used in intensity‐modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Often the dose must be delivered to depths greater than 20 cm. Therefore, during the commissioning of the BrainSCAN v5.21 or any radiation treatment‐planning (RTP) systems, extensive testing of dose and monitor unit calculations must encompass the field sizes (1 cm to 30 cm) and the prescription depths (1 cm to 20 cm). Accordingly, the central‐axis percent depth doses (PDDs) and off‐axis percentage profiles must be measured at several depths for various field sizes. The data for this study were acquired with a 6‐MV X‐ray beam from a Varian 2100EX LINAC with a water phantom at a source‐to‐surface distance (SSD) of 100 cm. These measurements were also used to generate a photon beam module, based on a photon pencil beam dose‐calculation algorithm with a fast‐Fourier transform method. To commission the photon beam module used in our BrainSCAN RTP system, we performed a quantitative comparison of measured and calculated central‐axis depth doses and off‐axis profiles. Utilizing the principles of dose difference and distance‐to‐agreement introduced by Van Dyk et al. [Commissioning and quality assurance of treatment planning computers. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1993; 26:261—273], agreements between calculated and measured doses are
