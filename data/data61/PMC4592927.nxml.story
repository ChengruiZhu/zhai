Necrotizing soft tissue infection of an extremity is a rare but life-threatening disease. The disease is an infection that involves the soft tissue layer and is characterized by rapidly spreading inflammation (especially of the fascial planes and the surrounding tissues) with a high mortality. Early diagnosis is essential for the outcome of the patients. Radical surgical debridement is the treatment of choice. The predisposing factors are immunosuppression, diabetes mellitus and drug abuse. This report presents a case of necrotizing fasciitis in the thigh, following an abscess of the sacro-iliac joint, as a rare complication in a young, immunosuppressed woman. The patientâ€™s history revealed intravenous drug abuse and hepatitis C. After immediate diagnosis by magnetic resonance imaging, radical surgical debridement was required and performed. Prior to soft tissue coverage with a split skin graft, five additional sequential debridements were necessary. During her hospital stay, the patient experienced further cerebral and pulmonary septic embolisms and an infection of the elbow. Six months after admission, the patient was discharged in good condition to a rehabilitation center. Necrotizing fasciitis is a life-threatening complication following an abscess of the sacro-iliac joint. Physicians must be vigilant to inflammatory signs and pain in immunosuppressed patients. An abscess of the sacro-iliac joint is rare, but complications of an untreated abscess can be fatal in these patients.
