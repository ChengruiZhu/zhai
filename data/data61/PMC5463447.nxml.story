The findings of EGFR mutations and the development of targeted therapies have significantly improved the overall survival of lung cancer patients. Still, the prognosis remains poor, so we need to know more about the genetic alterations in lung cancer. MicroRNAs are dysregulated in lung cancer, and some of them can regulate EGFR. So it is very important to predict the candidate microRNAs that target mutated EGFR and to investigate the role of these candidate microRNAs in lung cancer. In this study, we investigated the difference of microRNAs expression between lung adenocarcinoma cell lines with EGFR exon 19 deletion (H1650 and PC9) and wild-type (H1299 and A549) using the Phalanx Human Whole Genome Microarray. Then the expression of individual microRNAs was validated by qRT-PCR assays. Moreover, we detected the microRNAs expression in plasma of lung adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion and wild-type. Lastly, we explored the function of the positive microRNA in EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs ) resistance using MTT and Annexin V-APC assays. The expression of 1,732 microRNAs was evaluated, and we found that microRNAs expression was different between these two groups. Hsa-miR-141-3p, hsa-miR-200c-3p, hsa-miR-203, hsa-miR-3182, hsa-miR-934 were up-regulated and hsa-miR-3196 was down-regulated in the EGFR exon 19 deletion group compared with wild-type group. The detection of circulating microRNAs showed that miR-3196 was down-regulated in lung adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion compared with wild-type. And then the MTT assay results showed that miR-3196 had no effect on the sensitivity of erlotinib. The results of apoptosis analysis showed that inhibition of miR-3196 and erlotinib induced more apoptosis in H1299 cells than erlotinib alone, and overexpressed miR-3196 and erlotinib induced less apoptosis in PC9 cells than erlotinib alone (P<0.05). It is suggested that microRNAs associate with EGFR exon 19 deletion and miR-3196 may be further explored as a potential predictor and targeted biomarker when it is difficult to get the tumors.
