Pathways and Resources for Engagement and Participation (PREP), an innovative intervention aimed at modifying the environment and coaching youth/parents, was found to be effective in improving youth participation in chosen community activities. In order to complement existing quantitative evidence, this study examined parents’ perspectives on the PREP approach. Twelve parents of youth with physical disabilities (12 to 18 years old) who received the PREP approach participated in individual semi-structured interviews following the 12-week intervention delivered by an occupational therapist. Thematic analysis revealed three inter-linked themes, the first of which was informative, describing the “nature of intervention”, and led to two reflective themes: “multi-faceted effects of care” and “process of care”. Parents highlighted the effect of the PREP intervention in a broad sense, extending beyond the accomplishment of the selected activities. This involved improvements on the physical, emotional, and social levels as well as in autonomy. Parents also discussed how their own needs were acknowledged through the intervention and recognized the unique role of the occupational therapist in supporting this process. The findings provide additional information about the usefulness of the PREP approach and describe the various benefits generated by a single intervention. Such knowledge can expand the therapeutic options for positive, health-promoting participation.
