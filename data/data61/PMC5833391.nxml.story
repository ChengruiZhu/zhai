BMP2 expression is spatiotemporally correlated with embryo implantation and is crucial for endometrial decidualization and fertility in mice. BMP2 has been reported to increase the mesenchymal adhesion molecule N-cadherin and enhance cell invasion in cancer cells; moreover, studies suggest that N-cadherin promotes placental trophoblast invasion. However, whether BMP2 can promote trophoblast cell invasion during placentation remains unknown. The objective of our study was to investigate the effects of BMP2 on human trophoblast cell invasion and the involvement of N-cadherin and SMAD signaling. Primary and immortalized (HTR8/SVneo) cultures of human extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells were used as study models. Treatment with recombinant human BMP2 increased HTR8/SVneo cell transwell Matrigel invasion as well as N-cadherin mRNA and protein levels, but had no significant effect on cell proliferation. Likewise, BMP2 treatment enhanced primary human EVT cell invasion and N-cadherin production. Basal and BMP2-induced invasion were attenuated by small interfering RNA-mediated downregulation of N-cadherin in both HTR8/SVneo and primary EVT cells. Intriguingly, BMP2 induced the phosphorylation/activation of both canonical SMAD1/5/8 and non-canonical SMAD2/3 signaling in HTR8/SVneo and primary EVT cells. Knockdown of SMAD2/3 or common SMAD4 totally abolished the effects of BMP2 on N-cadherin upregulation in HTR8/SVneo cells. Upregulation of SMAD2/3 phosphorylation and N-cadherin were totally abolished by type I receptor activin receptor-like kinases 2/3 (ALK2/3) inhibitor DMH1; moreover, knockdown of ALK2 or ALK3 inhibited N-cadherin upregulation. Interestingly, activation of SMAD2/3 and upregulation of N-cadherin were partially attenuated by ALK4/5/7 inhibitor SB431542 or knockdown of ALK4, but not ALK5. Our results show that BMP2 promotes trophoblast cell invasion by upregulating N-cadherin via non-canonical ALK2/3/4-SMAD2/3-SMAD4 signaling.
