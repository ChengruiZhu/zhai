Proteoglycans (PGs) are expressed on the cell surface and extracellular matrix of all mammalian cells and tissues, playing an important role in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions and signaling. Changes in the expression and functional properties of individual PGs in prostate cancer are shown, although common patterns of PGs expression in normal and tumour prostate tissues remain unknown. In this study, expression of cell surface and stromal proteoglycans (glypican-1, perlecan, syndecan-1, aggrecan, versican, NG2, brevican, decorin, and lumican) in normal tissue and prostate tumours was determined by RT-PCR analysis and immunostaining with core protein- and GAG-specific antibodies. In normal human prostate tissue, versican, decorin, and biglycan were predominant proteoglycans localised in tissue stroma, and syndecan-1 and glypican-1 were expressed mainly by epithelial cells. In prostate tumours, complex changes in proteoglycans occur, with a common trend towards decrease of decorin and lumican expression, overall increase of syndecan-1 and glypican-1 expression in tumour stroma along with its disappearance in tumour epithelial cells, and aggrecan and NG2 expressions in some prostate tumours. All the changes result in the highly individual proteoglycan expression patterns in different prostate tumours, which may be potentially useful as molecular markers for prostate cancer personalised diagnosis and treatment.
