Efforts were made to generate C57BL/6 cytotoxic effector cells to a syngeneic leukemia (E{male}G2) bearing AKR/Gross virus antigens. As we were unable to induce significant cytotoxic activity by immunization with up to 10(8) irradiated E{male}G2 cells, even when cells from such primed animals were subsequently restimulated with E{male}G2 cells in vitro, C57BL/6 mice were immunized with an aliogeneic, virus-producing AKR leukemic cell line (AKR SL3). Peritoneal exudate cells and, to a lesser degree, spleen cells from these mice showed significant lytic activity toward the immunizing allogeneic tumor but not toward E{male}G2. When spleen cells were harvested from animals {approximately equal to}10 d after injection of AKR SL3 and rechallenged in vitro with either E{male}G2 or AKR.H-2(b) SL1, another tumor that displays AKR/Gross virus antigens, then a vigorous cytotoxic response against E{male}G2 and AKR. H-2(b) SL1 was obtained. Effector cells generated by AKR SL3 priming followed by in vitro stimulation with E{male}G2 or AKR.H-2(b) SL1 lysed only cells of H-2(b) haplotype which were strongly positive for the display of serologically detectable AKR/Gross virus antigens. Thus, AKR SL3 cells were not lysed nor were EL4 cells (H-2(b); but only weakly positive for gp70). Cells not bearing the MuLV antigens tested for, such as P815 mastocytoma cells and spleen cell "blasts" from C57BL/6 and CBA (H-2(k)) mice, were also insusceptible to attack. The cytotoxic effector cells induced bore Thy 1.2 alloantigen and were of the Lyt 1+2+ phenotype. Collectively, these findings are consistent with the conclusion that the cytotoxic T cells raised against E{male}G2 are directed against AKR/Gross virus-associated antigens and are H-2 restricted. It will be of interest to determine the relevance of such effector cells to the known resistance of the C57BL/6 mouse to AKR/Gross virus-induced leukemia.
