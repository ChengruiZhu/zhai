 1. A quantitative practical mouse test is described for measuring the immunizing potency of antirabies vaccines. 2. Virulent virus, injected intraperitoneally as a vaccine, immunized mice within 10 days and for a period of at least 9 months. Demonstrable neutralizing antibodies accompanied this immunity. Virus given subcutaneously failed to immunize as effectively. The margin between immunizing and infecting dose of vaccine was small. 3. Commercial vaccines containing virulent virus prepared for the treatment of man gave results similar to those obtained with laboratory virus. 4. Commercial vaccines inactivated with phenol and prepared for the treatment of man in general failed to immunize mice. None contained virulent virus. The phenolized preparation from one commercial firm, however, as also the chloroformized preparation from another, immunized mice consistently when given intraperitoneally in quantities approximating 5 times that advocated per gm. of body weight in man. 5. Commercial canine vaccines inactivated with phenol proved non-virulent and failed to immunize mice. 6. Commercial canine vaccines inactivated with chloroform (Kelser) proved non-virulent but capable of immunizing mice provided a single intraperitoneal injection of 2 to 5 times that prescribed for dogs per gm. of body weight was given. 7. Chloroformized vaccines proved irritative to the peritoneum of mice.
