Compound banmao capsule (CBC) is a traditional Chinese medicinal formula composed of extracts from 11 organisms. The present study investigated the mechanism of CBC on the biological behavior of human leukemia cell lines using seropharmacological methods. CBC-containing rat serum was prepared by intragastrical administration of CBC to rats. The proliferation of human leukemia HL60 and K562 cell lines was assayed by measuring cell viability with the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium method, while cell cycle distribution and the rate of apoptosis were evaluated with flow cytometry. The mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and chemotactic and inflammatory genes in human leukemia cell lines was examined using reverse transcription quantitative-polymerase chain reaction methods. It was revealed that the proliferation of K562 and HL60 cells was significantly inhibited by the CBC-containing rat serum at 72 h. The CBC-containing serum also promoted the apoptosis of K562 and HL60 cell lines. The CBC-containing serum altered the cell cycle progression of K562 and HL60, increasing the proportion of the cells in G1 phase and decreasing the proportion of the cells in S phase. Attenuated expression of VEGF-A and a decreasing trend in the expression of chemotactic and inflammatory genes were identified following treatment with CBC-containing serum in HL60 and K562 cells. In conclusion, CBC-containing serum exerted an inhibitory effect on the growth of K562 and HL60 cells by decreasing cellular proliferation, promoting apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, and decreasing the expression of VEGF-A, and chemotactic and inflammatory genes.
