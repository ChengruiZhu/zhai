Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a disease with an unknown cause and a poor prognosis. In this study, we aimed to explore the pathogenesis of PF and the mechanism of sulindac in attenuating bleomycin (BLM)-induced PF. The rat PF model was induced by BLM and verified through histological studies and hydroxyproline assay. The severity of BLM-induced PF in rats and other effects, such as the extent of the wet lung to bw ratios, thickening of alveolar interval or collagen deposition, was obviously ameliorated in sulindac-treated rat lungs compared with BLM-induced lungs. Sulindac also reversed the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and inhibited the PF process by restoring the levels of E-cadherin and α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) in A549 cells. Our results further demonstrated that the above effects of sulindac might be related to regulating of interferon gamma (IFN-γ) expression, which further affects signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) and phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) levels. Moreover, higher miR-21 levels with the decreased E-cadherin and increased α-SMA expressions were found in transforming growth factor-β1-treated A549 cells, which can be reversed by sulindac. Collectively, our results demonstrate that by decreasing IFN-γ-induced STAT3/p-STAT3 expression to down-regulate miR-21, sulindac could significantly reverse EMT in A549 cells and prevent BLM-induced PF.
