OBJECTIVES: To examine the accuracy of a commercial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test (Amplicor CTR, Roche Diagnostic Systems, Branchburg NJ) for identification of endocervical chlamydial infections through both laboratory evaluation and among a diverse teaching hospital patient population. METHODS: Testing of reliable threshold inocula and reproducibility were carried out using laboratory stock organisms. Paired endocervical samples from patients with a wide range of indications were tested by PCR and an established culture procedure, and discrepant pairs were further analyzed to determine true results. RESULTS: Laboratory evaluation suggested that one copy of target DNA from a viable organism consistently yielded a positive result, and test reproducibility was very good, with an overall coefficient of variation of 15%. Compared to true results in 1,588 paired clinical samples from 1,489 women with a 10% prevalence of infection, the PCR test and culture yielded respective sensitivities of 87.4% and 78.0%, and negative predictive values of 98.6% and 97.6%. Specificity and positive predictive value for both tests were 100%. Cost per specimen was nearly identical at $18.84 and $18.88 respectively. Polymerase inhibitors and organisms lacking target DNA were not found in false-negative PCR samples. CONCLUSION: This commercial PCR test is accurate, cost-competitive, and much faster than culture for diagnosis of endocervical chlamydia infections in our population of intermediate prevalence of chlamydial infection.
