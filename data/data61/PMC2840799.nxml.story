Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) protein, a newly identified sterol influx transporter, located at the apical membrane of the enterocyte, which may actively facilitate the uptake of cholesterol by promoting the passage of sterols across the brush border membrane of the enterocyte. It effects intestinal cholesterol absorption and intracellular transport and as such is an integral part of complex process of cholesterol homeostasis. The study of population data for the distribution of these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of NPC1L1 has lead to the identification of six non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNP). The in vitro analysis using the software MuPro and StructureSNP shows that nsSNP M510I (rs1468384), which involves Aâ†’G base pair change leads to decrease in the stability of the protein. A reproducible and a cost-effective PCR-RFLP based assay was developed to screen for the SNP among population data. This SNP has been studied in Caucasian, Asian, and African American populations. Till date, no data is available on Indian population. The distribution of M510I NPC1L1 genotype was estimated in the North Western Indian Population as a test case. The allele distribution in Indian Population differs significantly from that of other populations. The methodology thus proved to be robust enough to bring out these differences.
