The vascularized fibular flap is one of the standard treatment choices for the reconstruction of the mandible; however, the consequences of condylar restoration have not previously been reported. The use of three-dimensional models allows for a more predictable reconstruction. The purpose of the present study was to assess the outcome of stereolithographic model-assisted reconstruction of the mandibular condyle with a vascularized fibular flap. A total of 5 patients underwent mandibular resection including the condyle and immediate reconstruction with a vascularized fibular flap. A stereolithographic model was used to determine the length and angle of the bony reconstruction. In all patients, the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disc was preserved, and the contoured fibular end was placed directly into the glenoid fossa under the TMJ disc. To investigate the morphological and functional outcomes, radiographic and clinical examinations were performed, and a food scale questionnaire was administered. The mean period of follow-up was 23 months, and all the flaps were viable. Cosmetic results were generally satisfactory. Radiographic assessment revealed that the end of the fibular graft became round-shaped. None of the patients had abnormal bone resorption, dislocation or ankylosis. The mean value of maximum mouth opening was 31 mm. No patients exhibited difficulties with occlusion. All patients recovered their ability to ingest nearly the same foods that were ingested prior to surgery. The stereolithographic model-assisted reconstruction of mandibular condyle with a vascularized fibular flap is therefore useful for morphological and functional reconstructions of the hemimandible, including condylar defects.
