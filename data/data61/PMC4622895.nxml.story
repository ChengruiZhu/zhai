Seborrheic keratosis is a common benign epidermal tumor histologically composed of basaloid and squamous cells. It mainly occurs on the face, scalp, and trunk, and presents clinically as a well-circumscribed, brownish to black papule, nodule, or plaque. Trichoblastoma is a relatively rare benign, slow-growing tumor showing differentiation toward the primitive hair follicle. It clinically manifests as a solitary, skin to erythematous colored, well-circumscribed dermal nodule located predominantly on the head and neck with a predilection for the scalp. Histologically, a well-demarcated mass of follicular germinative cells that show various degrees of differentiation, arranged in lobules, sheets, and nests, is located in the dermis or subcutaneous fat layer. We report the case of a 28-year-old female patient with a solitary, 2.0Ã—4.0-cm black plaque with a 0.7-cm skin-colored nodule on the scalp. Histologically, the entire black plaque had prominent hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and papillomatosis with horn cysts. The central nodule showed well-circumscribed, various-sized dermal tumor lobules without a connection to the overlying epidermis. The lobular aggregation was composed of numerous basaloid epithelial nests and multiple primitive papillary structures with distinct peripheral palisading of nuclei. According to these findings, the scalp lesion was diagnosed as a composite tumor associating trichoblastoma and seborrheic keratosis.
