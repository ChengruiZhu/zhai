). The molecule was purified to apparent homogeneity for further characterization. An amino acid sequence of an 11-mer internal peptide of p38.5 did not exhibit homology to known proteins. Affinity-purified antibody generated against this peptide (anti-p38.5) reacted with a single protein of 38.5 kD on Western blots of whole cell extracts of K562. Flow cytometry and immunoprecipitation studies of surface-labeled tumor cells demonstrated expression of p38.5 on NK-susceptible tumor cell lines (K562, MOLT-4, Jurkat), whereas p38.5 was not detected on NK-resistant tumor cell lines (A549, Raji, MDA-MB-231). Significantly, p38.5 loss variants derived from wild-type Jurkat and Molt-4 cell lines exhibited decreased susceptibility to NK cellâ€“mediated lysis demonstrating a strong association between cell surface expression of p38.5 and cytotoxicity. Purified p38.5 retained preferential binding to NK cells and inhibited NK activity in a dose-dependent manner, thereby providing direct evidence of a role in the lytic process. Binding studies identified a 70-kD membrane protein from NK cells as a possible receptor for the p38.5 tumor ligand. Consistent with cellular adsorption studies, the 70-kD, p38.5 binding protein was not detected on T lymphocytes. Based on studies demonstrating selective binding of p38.5 to NK cells, lack of expression on NK-resistant tumor cell lines and ability of the purified molecule to block cytolysis, we conclude that p38.5 may serve as a recognition/triggering ligand for naive human NK cells.
