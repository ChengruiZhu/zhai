 562 mµ, a minimum at about 435 mµ, and a small β-band in the near ultraviolet at about 370 mµ. The low concentration of iodopsin in the cones explains to a first approximation their high threshold, and hence their status as organs of daylight vision. The relatively rapid synthesis of iodopsin compared with rhodopsin parallels the relatively rapid dark adaptation of cones compared with rods. A theoretical relation is derived which links the logarithm of the visual sensitivity with the concentration of visual pigment in the rods and cones. Plotted in these terms, the course of rod and cone dark adaptation resembles closely the synthesis of rhodopsin and iodopsin in solution. The spectral sensitivities of rod and cone vision, and hence the Purkinje phenomenon, have their source in the absorption spectra of rhodopsin and iodopsin. In the chicken, for which only rough spectral sensitivity measurements are available, this relation can be demonstrated only approximately. In the pigeon the scotopic sensitivity matches the spectrum of rhodopsin; but the photopic sensitivity is displaced toward the red, largely or wholly through the filtering action of the colored oil globules in the pigeon cones. In cats, guinea pigs, snakes, and frogs, in which no such colored ocular structures intervene, the scotopic and photopic sensitivities match quantitatively the absorption spectra of rhodopsin and iodopsin. In man the scotopic sensitivity matches the absorption spectrum of rhodopsin; but the photopic sensitivity, when not distorted by the yellow pigmentations of the lens and macula lutea, lies at shorter wave lengths than iodopsin. This discrepancy is expected, for the human photopic sensitivity represents a composite of at least three classes of cone concerned with color vision.
