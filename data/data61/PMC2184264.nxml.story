Transplacental induction of lung tumors in C3HfeB/HeN (C3Hf) strain mice can be readily achieved with the carcinogen 1-ethyl-1-nitrosourea. Several of these tumors express, as a tumor-associated transplantation antigen (TATA), a normal tissue alloantigen present in strain A and C3H/HeN (C3H) mice. In the present study it was shown that the tumor-associated alloantigen on the C3Hf-derived lung tumor 85 was present in all mice of H-2(a) and H-2(k) haplotypes tested and in CBA (532) strain mice (H-2(ka) haplotype). Studies using congenic-resistant and recombinant strains of mice indicated that the genetic locus controlling the expression of this antigen was either within or to the left of the H-2K region of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Thus the antigen was expressed in B10.A (4R) mice (kkbbbb MHC haplotype) but not in B10 (bbbbbb) or B10.AQR mice (qkkddd). The antigen was expressed in all tissues tested of C3H and A strain mice. It was not detected on any tissue tested including embryo tissue of C3Hf mice or mice of MHC haplotype other than H-2(k) or H-2(a). Because C3Hf strain mice were originally derived from C3H strain mice (H-2(k)), the MHC haplotype of C3Hf mice has been provisionally designated H-2(kb). The finding of a tumor-associated change in the expression of a H-2K region-coded antigen is consistent with the concept that MHC-coded antigens may act as targets for immunological surveillance of tumors.
