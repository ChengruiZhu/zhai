The aim of the present meta-analysis is to determine the clinical and radiographic outcomes of using platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) for the treatment of periodontal intra-bony defect (IBD) compared with open flap debridement (OFD). MEDLINE/PubMed, EBSCO and Cochrane database were used to identify studies in English language published from January 1, 2005 to January 31, 2013. An additional hand search of the relevant journals and of the bibliographies of the paper identified was also performed. Articles retrieved were screened using specific inclusion criteria by five independent reviewers: Studies investigating the effect of platelet concentrate in surgical procedure for the treatment of periodontal intra osseous defects compared with the control group in which platelet concentrate was not used were included. Five relevant articles were selected for the meta-analysis of which 3 articles were retrieved after electronic search and two articles were included after hand search. The number of patients in studies ranged from 15 to 62 (32-90 sites) with mean age ranging from 29.47 to 39.7. A total of 298 sites were treated using PRF either in combination with graft or as a monotherapy in comparison to traditional OFD procedure. The meta-analysis showed a standard mean difference of 0.95 mm; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.20-1.71 in clinical attachment level (CAL) and 2.33 mm; 95% CI: 1.43-3.23 in IBD after treatment of IBD with PRF compared with OFD. The meta-analysis showed clinically significant improvements in periodontal parameters such as CAL, IBD, and reduction in probing depth when IBDs were treated with PRF alone when compared to OFD.
