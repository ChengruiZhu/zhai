In order to investigate the predictive factors related to clinical efficacy and radiographic progression at 24 weeks by looking at the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 including baseline characteristics in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with golimumab, serum concentrations of TNF-α and IL-6 were analyzed every 4 weeks up to 24 weeks in 47 patients treated with golimumab. Baseline levels of the Disease Activity Score 28 C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) and Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) scores were also assessed. Radiographic progression using the van der Heijde-modified Sharp (vdH-S) score was assessed in 29 patients. Multiple regression analyses related to the DAS28-CRP score and delta total sharp score at 24 weeks was undertaken using the baseline characteristics of patients and serum concentrations of matrix metallo-proteinase (MMP)-3, TNF-α, and IL−6. The DAS28-CRP score and SDAI decreased significantly at 4 weeks up to 24 weeks compared with baseline. Serum levels of TNF-α were not changed significantly up to 24 weeks compared with baseline, but those of IL-6 decreased significantly at 4 weeks up to 8 weeks. Multiple regression analyses showed that disease duration and serum levels of MMP-3 were related significantly to the DAS28-CRP score at 24 weeks. Radiographic progression was related significantly to disease duration with regard to joint space narrowing and bone erosion. However, serum levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were not correlated significantly with the DAS28-CRP score and radiographic progression. These data suggest that decreasing serum levels of IL-6 significantly, MMP-3, and disease duration are predictive factors for RA activity in patients taking golimumab.
