A variety of conditions including certain cancers and heart diseases, diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis have been associated with the generation of high levels of highly reactive molecular species under conditions known as “oxidative stress.” A number of protein molecules have been identified as participants in an elaborate response to oxidative stress. Sustained elevated generation of reactive species can overwhelm this response and lead to disease conditions. In these studies, we make use of data generated from over 250 studies (microarrays) in which messenger RNA levels of the gene precursors of mouse lung proteins have been examined collectively. We have made use of computational approaches to help identify the key regulatory relationships among the proteins that respond to oxidative stress. Nrf2, a protein known as a master regulator of oxidative stress response, was a principal focus of our studies. Among the novel regulatory targets of Nrf2 we identified is Als2, a protein involved in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease). We also identify important candidate three-party regulatory relationships, one of which involves the recently discovered Srxn1, an antioxidant protein that reverses S-glutathionylation, a common posttranslational modification associated with diseases such as Parkinson's disease, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, Friedreich's ataxia, renal cell carcinoma, and HIV/AIDS. These studies demonstrate the utility of network inference algorithms and affirm that Nrf2 has a direct regulatory role over the expression of other genes responding to oxidative stress.
