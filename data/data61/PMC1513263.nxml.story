Aging is a complex phenomenon characterized by the decay of biological function over time, eventually leading to death. High-throughput methods for examining changes in the expression of genes, such as DNA microarrays, have been successful in elucidating some of the genome-wide changes that occur with age in several human tissues. The authors profiled gene expression changes in the muscles of 81 individuals with ages spanning eight decades. They found 250 genes and 3 genetic pathways that displayed altered levels of expression in the elderly. The transcriptional profile of age-regulated genes was able to discern elderly patients with severe muscle aging from those that retained high levels of muscle function; that is, the gene expression profiles reflected physiological as well as chronological age. In order to find genetic changes that might affect most or all tissues during aging, the authors compared genome-wide profiles of aging in the muscle to those in the kidney and the brain, and found a common signature for aging shared among these three tissues consisting of six genetic pathways. One of these aging pathways (the electron transport chain pathway) is age regulated not only in humans but also in two model organisms (mice and flies), providing insights about shared age-related changes in animals with vastly different lifespans.
