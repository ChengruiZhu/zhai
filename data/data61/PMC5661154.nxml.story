Eosinophilic dermatosis of hematologic malignancy is a rare papulovesicular eruption that presents in patients with hematoproliferative disorders, particularly chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A 59-year-old woman with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who developed eosinophilic dermatosis of hematologic malignancy mimicking varicella zoster infection is described. PubMed database was searched with the key words: chronic, dermatosis, eosinophilic, hematologic, infection, leukemia, lymphocytic, malignancy, varicella, zoster. The papers generated by the search and their references were reviewed. The patient presented, on more than 20 occasions, with a dermatomal vesicular eruption. Her oncologist, based on the clinical presentation, treated each episode as recurrent varicella zoster virus infection. A complete workup of the patient not only demonstrated negative viral studies but also revealed pathologic changes consistent with eosinophilic dermatosis of hematologic malignancy on lesional skin biopsy. The recurrence of the patient’s dermatosis was less frequent when her malignancy was under better control. Eosinophilic dermatosis of hematologic malignancy may mimic other reactive dermatoses. The morphology of our patient’s recurrent dermatosis resembled varicella zoster virus infection. Disseminated zoster virus infection with dermatomal and non-dermatomal distribution should be added to the clinical differential diagnosis of eosinophilic dermatosis of hematologic malignancy.
