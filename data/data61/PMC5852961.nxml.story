The forkhead transcription factor FOXK2 plays a critical role in suppressing tumorigenesis and mediating cytotoxic drug action in breast cancer. However, the mechanism by which the biological function of FOXK2 is regulated remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of SUMOylation in modulating FOXK2-mediated drug sensitivity. We identified SUMOylation consensus motifs within the FOXK2 sequence and constructed two SUMOylation-defective double mutants by converting lysine 527 and 633 to arginines and glutamic acid 529 and 635 to alanines, respectively. We found that both the FOXK2 SUMOylation-deficient (K527/633 R) and (E529/635 A) mutants were ineffective in mediating the cytotoxic function of paclitaxel when compared to the wild-type (WT) FOXK2. When overexpressed, unlike the wild-type (WT) FOXK2, the K527/633 R mutant had little effect on the sensitivity of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells to paclitaxel, as examined by cell viability and clonogenic assays. Our results also showed that MCF-7 cells overexpressing the K527/633 R mutant form of FOXK2 or the empty expression vector have lower protein and mRNA levels of its tumour suppressive transcriptional target FOXO3 compared to the wild-type FOXK2. Consistently, ChIP assays revealed that unlike wild-type FOXK2, the SUMOylation-defective (K527/633 R) mutant is unable to bind to the
