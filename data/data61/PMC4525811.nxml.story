Vortioxetine is approved for the treatment of adults with major depressive disorder. This open-label extension (OLE) study evaluated the safety and tolerability of vortioxetine in the long-term treatment of major depressive disorder patients, as well as evaluated its effectiveness using measures of depression, anxiety, and overall functioning. This was a 52-week, flexible-dose, OLE study in patients who completed one of three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8-week vortioxetine trials. All patients were switched to 10 mg/day vortioxetine for week 1, then adjusted between 15 and 20 mg for the remainder of the study, but not downtitrated below 15 mg. Safety and tolerability were assessed on the basis of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), vital signs, laboratory values, physical examination, and the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Efficacy measures included the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, the Clinical Global Impression Scale-Severity of Illness, and the Sheehan Disability Scale. Of the 1075 patients enrolled, 1073 received at least one dose of vortioxetine and 538 (50.0%) completed the study. A total of 537 patients withdrew early, with 115 (10.7% of the original study population) withdrawing because of TEAEs. Long-term treatment with vortioxetine was well tolerated; the most common TEAEs (≥10%) were nausea and headache. Laboratory values, vital signs, and physical examinations revealed no trends of clinical concern. The mean Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score was 19.9 at the start of the extension study and 9.0 after 52 weeks of treatment (observed cases). Similar improvements were observed with the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (Δ−4.2), the Clinical Global Impression Scale-Severity of Illness (Δ−1.2), and the Sheehan Disability Scale (Δ−4.7) total scores after 52 weeks of treatment (observed case). In this 52-week, flexible-dose OLE study, 15 and 20 mg vortioxetine were safe and well tolerated. After entry into this study, patients continued to show improvement in depression and anxiety symptoms, as well as overall functioning, throughout the treatment period.
