Veterans phoning VA’s TT system, and those admitted or seen at a VA facility with influenza or influenza-like-illness (ILI) diagnosis were included in this analysis. Influenza-specific ICD-9-CM coded emergency department (ED) and urgent care (UC) visits, hospitalizations, TT calls, and ILI outpatient visits were analyzed covering 2010–2011 and 2011–2012 influenza seasons (July 11, 2010–April 14, 2012). Data came from 80 VA Medical Centers and over 500 outpatient clinics with complete reporting data for the time period of interest. We calculated Spearman rank-order coefficients, 95% confidence intervals and p-values using Fisher’s z transformation to describe correlation between TT data and other influenza healthcare measures. For comparison of time trends, we plotted data for hospitalizations, ED/UC visits and outpatient ILI syndrome visits against TT encounters. We applied ESSENCE detection algorithms to identify high-level alerts for influenza activity. ESSENCE aberration detection was restricted to the 2011–2012 season because limited historical TT and outpatient data from 2009–2010 was available to accurately predict aberrancy in the 2010–2011 season. We then calculated the peak measure of healthcare utilization during both influenza seasons (2010–2011 and 2011–2012) for each data source and compared timing of peaks and alerts between TT and other healthcare encounters to assess maximum healthcare system usage and timeliness of surveillance.
