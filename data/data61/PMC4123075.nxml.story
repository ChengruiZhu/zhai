Pemetrexed, a folate antimetabolite, combined with cisplatin is used as a first-line therapy for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Pemetrexed arrests cell cycle by inhibiting three enzymes in purine and pyrimidine synthesis that are necessary for DNA synthesis. Pemetrexed also promotes apoptosis in target cells, but little is known about its mechanism in cancer cells. We have previously shown that pemetrexed can result in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and it can lead to downstream apoptosis. In this study, we further elucidate this mechanism. Our data show that pemetrexed increases Noxa expression through activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) upregulation. Furthermore, pemetrexed induces apoptosis by activating the Noxa–Usp9x–Mcl-1 pathway. Inhibition of Noxa by small interfering RNA (siRNA) promotes Usp9x (ubiquitin-specific peptidase 9, X-linked) expression. Moreover, downregulation of the deubiquitinase Usp9x by pemetrexed results in downstream reduction of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) expression. Mechanistically, Noxa upregulation likely reduces the availability of Usp9x to Mcl-1, thereby promoting its ubiquitination and degradation, leading to the apoptosis of neoplastic cells. Thus, our findings demonstrate that Noxa–Usp9x-Mcl–1 axis may contribute to pemetrexed-induced apoptosis in human lung cancer cells.
