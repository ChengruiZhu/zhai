This study investigated the effect of miR-101 on proliferation, migration, invasion, and chemotherapy sensitivity in colon cancer cell lines HT-29 and RKO. MicroRNAs are a class of small noncoding RNA molecules, which play important roles in diverse biological processes of human cancers, such as carcinogenesis, development, differentiation, and apoptosis. The expression of miR-101 in colon cancer and adjacent non-tumor tissues were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The expression of miR-101 was upregulated by recombinant adenovirus Ad-miR-101. Cell proliferation was detected by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and cloning methods. Cell migration and invasion potential were examined using Transwell migration and Matrigel invasion chamber assays. Drug sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin (DDP) was explored using MTT assays and l acridine orange/ethidium bromide double staining. The expression of miR-101 decreased in colon cancer tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues. The upregulated expression of miR-101 suppressed cell proliferation and inhibited cell migration and invasion in HT-29 and RKO colon cancer cell lines. The overexpression of miR-101 promoted the inhibitory effect of 5-FU and DDP on HT-29 cells. The expression of miR-101 was downregulated in colon cancer. The upregulated expression of miR-101 inhibited proliferation and migration, and increased the sensitivity of colon cancer cells to chemotherapy.
