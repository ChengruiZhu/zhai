The American College of Radiology (ACR) Computed Tomography (CT) Accreditation Program requires submission of phantom scans acquired with the ACR accreditation phantom. There is a known issue with some wide‐beam scanners in which the Hounsfield unit (HU) value of water may be correct when using the scanner manufacturer's phantom, but will be out of range in some scan modes when scanning the accreditation phantom. The phantom manufacturer has developed a product known as Extension Plates to eliminate the water HU value issue. The purpose of this technical note is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Extension Plates in alleviating the water HU issue. The ACR phantom was scanned on nine different CT scanners representing four CT manufacturers at eight different facilities. Scanner models included 16‐ and 64‐channel geometries from each manufacturer. All scanners passed routine daily water HU testing per the manufacturer's instructions. The accreditation phantom was scanned in helical and axial modes both with and without the Extension Plates present. Regions of interest were placed on the linearity test objects as well as the water HU test object in Module 1 of the phantom. Mean values were recorded and compared with the acceptable ranges specified by the ACR accreditation phantom testing instructions. Water HU values failed for one scanner model when scanned in helical mode using the widest collimation available and the Extension Plates were not present. All other scanner models passed the water HU linearity test with or without the Extension Plates in both axial and helical scan modes. Three of the four manufacturers tested failed the linearity test for different materials. The presence of the Extension Plates only affected the HU measurement for the water test object.
