In adult liver transplantation, renoportal anastomosis (RPA) has been introduced as a useful technique for patients with grade 4 portal vein thrombosis and a splenorenal shunt. Here, we report a pediatric case in which RPA allowed a left lateral lobe living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) despite portal vein thrombosis and a large splenorenal shunt. At 36 days old, the patient underwent a Kasai operation for biliary atresia. At 17 months old, she underwent LDLT because of repetitive cholangitis. Pretransplant examinations revealed a large splenorenal shunt and portal vein thrombosis. Simple end-to-end portal reconstruction and clamping of the collateral route after removing the thrombosis were unsuccessful. Thus, RPA was performed using a donor superficial femoral vein as an interpositional graft. The portal vein pressure was 20 mm Hg after arterial reperfusion. Ligation of the splenic artery reduced the portal vein pressure. Although she developed severe acute cellular rejection and chylous ascites, there were no signs of portal vein complications. She was discharged 73 days after transplantation without any signs of renal dysfunction. The patient's condition was good at her last follow-up, 22 months after transplantation. To our knowledge, this is the youngest case of RPA in pediatric left lateral lobe LDLT. Additionally, this is the first case of RPA with splenic artery ligation and using the donor's superficial femoral vein as the venous graft for RPA. Although long-term follow-up is necessary, RPA could be a salvage option in LDLT in infants if other methods are unsuccessful.
