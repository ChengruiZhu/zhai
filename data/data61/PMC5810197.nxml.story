Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are an important component of stem-cell niches, which are able to promote the self-renewal and pluripotency of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The biological functions of these two cell types is dependent on adhesion, and the adhesion between MSCs and EPCs is important due to their critical role in neovascularization and bone regeneration in tissue engineering. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1, also known as cluster of differentiation 54), is a member of the immunoglobulin supergene family, which functions in cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesive interactions. Compared with other adhesion molecules, ICAM-1 is expressed in hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells, and can mediate adhesive interactions. The present study aimed to investigate the importance of ICAM-1 in the adhesion of MSCs and EPCs, and demonstrated that adhesion between these cells could be regulated by interleukin (IL)-1Î² via the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. In addition, the results confirmed that ICAM-1 served a critical role in regulation of adhesion between MSCs and EPCs. ELISA, cell immunofluorescence, western blot analysis and adhesion assay were used to confirm our theory from phenomenon to essence. The present study provided evidence to support and explain the adhesion between MSCs and EPCs. Furthermore, the present findings provide a theoretical basis for further stem-cell niche transplantation to increase understanding of the function of MSCs and the crosstalk between MSCs and EPCs in the stem-cell niche.
