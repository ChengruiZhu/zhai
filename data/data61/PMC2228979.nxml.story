The effects of tight junction structure on water and solute fluxes across proximal tubular epithelium were examined with fiber-matrix equations previously derived by Curry and Michel (1980. Microvascular Research. 20:96-99). Using plausible estimates of tight junction fiber length and width the model predicts solute (Ps) and water permeability (Lp) coefficients that agree with the measured values. When fiber- matrix and pore models were compared for physiologically relevant ranges of matrix void fraction (80-98%) and pore radii (0-20 A), the fiber-matrix model predicted a 10-fold higher Lp/Ps ratio. Lp/Ps was most sensitive to small changes in tight junction structure when void fractions exceeded 90%. Void fractions of 96.5% and 97.1% predicted previously measured values for Lp and solute permeabilities in rat and rabbit proximal tubules. These values are consistent with void fractions and permeabilities of artificial membranes. The fiber-matrix tight junction model was incorporated into a model of reabsorption from the rat proximal tubule developed by Weinstein (1984). American Journal of Physiology. 247:F848-F862.) A void fraction of 98% predicted the experimental results for isosmotic reabsorption driven by active transport. Changing void fraction over the range of 97-99% produced a 50-75% change in predicted volume reabsorption with active transport. According to the fiber-matrix model: (a) solute permeabilities alone cannot be used to predict Lp, (b) previously measured solute permeabilities in the proximal tubule are compatible with significant water reabsorption through a water-permeable tight junction, and (c) hydraulic and solute permeabilities may be sensitive to small changes in tight junction fiber length and diameter or ionic strength within the tight junction.
