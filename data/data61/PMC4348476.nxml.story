Experimental aspect of the corrosion inhibition potential of adenine (AD), guanine (GU) and, hypoxanthine (HYP) was carried out using weight loss, potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods while the theoretical aspect of the work was carried out by calculations of semi-empirical parameters (for AM1, MNDO, CNDO, PM3 and RM1 Hamiltonians), Fukui functions and inhibitorâ€“metal interaction energies. Results obtained from the experimental studies were in good agreement and indicated that adenine (AD), guanine (GU) and hypoxanthine (HYP) are good adsorption inhibitors for the corrosion of aluminum in solutions of HCl. Data obtained from electrochemical experiment revealed that the studied purines functioned by adsorption on the aluminum/HCl interface and inhibited the cathodic half reaction to a greater extent and anodic half reaction to a lesser extent. The adsorption of the purines on the metal surface was found to be exothermic and spontaneous. Deviation of the adsorption characteristics of the studied purines from the Langmuir adsorption model was compensated by the fitness of Flory Huggins and El Awardy et al. adsorption models. Quantum chemical studies revealed that the experimental inhibition efficiencies of the studied purines are functions of some quantum chemical parameters including total energy of the molecules (TE), energy gap (
