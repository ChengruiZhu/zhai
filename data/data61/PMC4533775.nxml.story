The upregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling occurs in virtually all types of kidney disease and is associated with podocyte injury. However, the precise mechanisms involved in the development of kidney disease remain to be elucidated. MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are a class of short non-coding RNAs and they have been shown to be regulators of gene expression, mainly by binding to the untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs. The aim of the present study was to determine the role of the 2 members of the miR-135 family (miR-135a and miR-135b) in podocyte injury and to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the damage to podocytes. The results revealed that miR-135a and miR-135b were upregulated in models of podocyte injury and in glomeruli isolated from patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). The ectopic expression of miR-135a and miR-135b led to severe podocyte injury and the disorder of the podocyte cytoskeleton. Our findings demonstrated that miR-135a and miR-135b activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling and induced the nuclear translocation of β-catenin. Using luciferase reporter assays, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis, glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) was identified as a target gene of miR-135a and miR-135b. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that members of the miR-135 family (specifically miR-135a and miR-135b) regulate the expression of GSK3β, thus playing a role in the development of podocyte injury and the disorder of the podocyte cytoskeleton. This is an important finding as it may contribute to the development of novel therapeutics for podocyte injury-associated glomerulopathies.
