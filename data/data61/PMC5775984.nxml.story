Quaternary ammonium salts (QAS), both linear and bicyclic, are often utilized to improve the mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of peptides by fixing a permanent positive charge on the analyzed molecule. However, during collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiments, QAS undergo unwanted side reactions—Hofmann elimination as well as a tertiary amine loss— rendering the data interpretation complicated. In this work, we present 2-thia- and 2-oxa-5-azoniaspiro[4.4]nonyl groups as heterocyclic derivatives of the highly stable ionization group, 5-azoniaspiro[4.4]nonyl, for a sensitive peptide analysis by MS. Due to the permanent positive charge, labeled peptides are characterized by enhanced ionization efficiency during electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) conditions. Moreover, interpretation of the CID fragmentation of labeled peptides is facilitated since a series of generated fragmentation ions enable a complete sequence coverage. Introduction of a heteroatom into the 5-azoniaspiro[4.4]nonyl scaffold allows for liberation of a stable reporter ion which could be used in selected reaction monitoring (SRM)-targeted quantification experiments. Additionally, we synthesized a deuterated analog of the tag for LC-SRM-targeted quantitative analysis. The obtained results indicate the general usefulness of the proposed heterocyclic quaternary ammonium ionization tag for sequencing and quantification of peptides.
