Two sets of response criteria using PET are currently available to monitor metabolic changes in solid tumors: the criteria developed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC criteria) and the PET Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST). We conducted this pooled study to investigate the strength of agreement between the EORTC criteria and PERCIST in the assessment of tumor response. We surveyed MEDLINE, EMBASE and PUBMED for articles with terms of the EORTC criteria and PERCIST between 2009 and January 2016. We searched for all the references of relevant articles and reviews using the ‘related articles’ feature in the PUBMED. There were six articles with the data on the comparison of the EORTC criteria and PERCIST. A total of 348 patients were collected; 190 (54.6%) with breast cancer, 81 with colorectal cancer, 45 with lung cancer, 14 with basal cell carcinoma in the skin, 12 with stomach cancer, and 6 with head and neck cancer. The agreement of tumor response between the EORTC criteria and PERCIST was excellent (k = 0.946). Of 348 patients, only 12 (3.4%) showed disagreement between the two criteria in the assessment of tumor response. The shift of tumor response between the EORTC criteria and PERCIST occurred mostly in patients with PMR and SMD. The estimated overall response rates were not significantly different between the two criteria (72.7% by EORTC vs. 73.6% by PERCIST). In conclusion, this pooled analysis demonstrates that the EORTC criteria and PERCIST showed almost perfect agreement in the assessment of tumor response.
