For the control group, 24 sutures were passed. 25.0% (6/24) were passed through the infraspinatus tendon, and 75%(18/75) were through the teres or infraspinatus muscle or MTJ. Sutures passage through the infraspinatus were an average of 25±5.4 mm distal to the PLA, while teres minor sutures were an average of 35.8±5.7mm distal to the PLA. If passes were less than 3 cm distal to the PLA, there was a significantly higher rate of infraspinatus tendon penetration (odds ratio[OR]=25 ,p<0.01). Sutures passing through muscle and MTJ were significantly more medial than those passing through tendon, at an average 8.1±5.1mm lateral to the PLA compared to 14.5±5.5mm (p<0.02). Passes were more likely to be in tendon, rather than muscle or MTJ if greater than 1 cm lateral to the PLA (p=0.013). The safe zone was defined as passing all tenodesis sutures greater than 1 cm lateral and less then 3cm distal to the PLA. Utilizing this technique, 24 sutures were also passed arthroscopically in the remaining 6 specimens. 83.3% (20/24) were in the infraspinatus tendon, which was significantly improved from the control group (p<0.01). Only, 4.2% (1/24) of attempted passes in the SZ group passed through the muscle or MTJ which was also significantly improved from the control group (p<0.01). Prevention of over-medialization significantly improved using the SZ as represented by both anchors having suture passage significantly more lateral (6-10mm) than the control group (p<0.01). There was also an improvement in the precision of suture passes with utilization of the SZ, as overall precision (SD) improved in 75% of sutures passes.
