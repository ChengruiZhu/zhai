In biological systems mistakes are made constantly because the cellular machinery is complex and error-prone. Mistakes are made in copying DNA for transmission to offspring (“genetic mutations”) but are much more frequent in the day-to-day task of gene expression. Genetic mutations are heritable and therefore have long been the almost exclusive focus of evolutionary genetics research. In contrast, gene expression errors are not inherited and have tended to be disregarded in evolutionary studies. Here we show how human genes have evolved a mechanism to reduce the occurrence of a specific type of gene expression error—transcriptional errors that create premature STOP codons (so-called “nonsense errors”). Nonsense errors are potentially highly toxic for the cell, so natural selection has evolved a strategy called Nonsense Mediated Decay (NMD) to “cure” such errors. However this cure is inefficient. Here we describe how a preventative strategy of “transcriptional robustness” has evolved to decrease the frequency of nonsense errors. Moreover, these “prevention and cure” strategies are used interchangeably—the most transcriptionally robust genes are those for which NMD is most inefficient. Our work implies that gene expression errors play an important role as supporting actors to genetic mutations in molecular evolution, particularly in the evolution of robustness.
