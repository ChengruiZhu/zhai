The patient was a 48-year-old Caucasian male with no known past medical history, who presented with a combination of purpuric rash over the lower extremities, severe abdominal pain with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and a rapidly increasing serum creatinine, with hematuria. He initially underwent a skin biopsy, along with investigation for other possible causes, including autoimmune and infectious etiologies, which were negative. He was started on therapy for presumed HSP with intravenous methylprednisolone. The skin biopsy, however, was not conclusive, and the patient had no improvement in his clinical status. He then underwent a kidney biopsy that was consistent with HSP nephritis (immunoglobulin A (IgA) predominant glomerulonephritis with crescents), and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) that showed mucosal inflammation, ulcerations, and stigmata of bleeding—findings that were consistent with ischemia. Cyclophosphamide was added to the regimen at this time. However, he had worsening abdominal pain, continued gastrointestinal bleeding, now with hematochezia, and also worsening renal function that required dialysis. Plasmapheresis was then initiated on days alternating with dialysis. This resulted in the improvement of his gastrointestinal symptoms, but no recovery was seen of his renal function, and the patient required outpatient dialysis.
