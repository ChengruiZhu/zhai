In recent years, cases of elderly-onset ulcerative colitis (UC) have been increasing in number and are currently reported to account for 10â€“15% of all cases of UC. Although the treatment of UC is essentially similar between older and younger patients, evidence of the therapeutic efficacy of tacrolimus in elderly-onset UC patients is still limited. Herein, we report our attempt to induce remission using tacrolimus in three patients with elderly-onset UC. A 75-year-old Japanese woman, a 71-year-old Japanese man and a 76-year-old Japanese woman with severe elderly-onset UC of the pancolitis type were treated with tacrolimus. Although all three patients showed response to the drug, the eventual outcome was poor in the first patient, who developed toxic megacolon, underwent surgery, and suffered from recurrent infections and hemorrhage after the surgery. However, clinical remission was successfully achieved in the second and third patient. Tacrolimus shows some indication of effectiveness in the treatment of elderly-onset UC. However, in elderly-onset UC patients, it is necessary to keep in mind the higher risk of adverse effects of medical therapy and postoperative complications because of the high comorbidity rates. Moreover, in situations where surgery needs to be considered, it is important to ensure appropriate timing of the surgery.
