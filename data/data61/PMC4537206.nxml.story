Massive rearrangement of ions across the plasma membrane and changes in cellular volume are common features of states such as seizures, spreading depression, and ischemia. In this paper, we focus on how volume itself influences neuronal activity. We build a unified computational framework for a wide range of neuronal behaviors by exploiting their previously unexplored common features. By combining the dynamic ion concentrations and volume, conservation of charge, and the energy requirements of the cell within a Hodgkin-Huxley type framework, we demonstrate the feasibility of a comprehensive framework encompassing a wide range of neuronal behaviors. We show the spontaneous transition of a neuron between seizure and spreading depression when the cell swells and contracts in response to varying osmotic pressure as a result of the rearrangement of different ions. Our model closely reproduces anoxic depolarization and relevant neuronal swelling during ischemia and reveals a dynamical definition for the experimentally described physiological ceilings that demarcate seizure from spreading depression and spreading depression from anoxic depolarization. This study opens up a new way of studying neuronal behavior where different states need not be treated separately but rather as a dynamical continuum of the neuronal membrane potential and its microenvironment.
