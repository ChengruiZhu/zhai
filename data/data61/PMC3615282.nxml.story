The role of stress induced development of Type-1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) as opposed to autoimmunity remains obscure. It has been reported that a stress induced protein, identified to be dermcidin isoform 2 (dermcidin) inhibited insulin synthesis in both the pancreatic β cells and the hepatic cells. As dermcidin effect could be neutralized by the increased production of systemic nitric oxide (NO), investigations were carried out to determine the feasibility of controlling stress induced T1DM through the neutralization of dermcidin by systemic increase of NO. To determine the role of plasma dermcidin level in T1DM subjects (n=45), if any, when the plasma dermcidin level were determined, it was found that the protein level was increased in 65% of the participating volunteers. Efforts were made to normalize the plasma glucose level (median=175 mg/dL) in these T1DM subjects by systemic increase of NO by applying a cotton pad containing 0.28mmol sodium nitroprusside on the abdominal skin. It was found that the systemic increase of NO level decreased the blood glucose level of 275 mg/dL (median) to 115 mg/dL (median) in these volunteers within 24 h with concomitant increase of plasma insulin level from 7.5 μunits/dL to 101 μunits/dL at the same time. The increase of plasma insulin level was accompanied by the decrease of dermcidin level of 124.5 nM to 18 nM with increase of NO from 0.43 ± 0.19 nM to 4.1 ± 1.56 nM. The results suggested that the stress induced T1DM by dermcidin could be controlled by the systemic increase of NO which in consequence led to increased synthesis of insulin.
