Alveolar soft-part sarcoma (ASPS) is a rare sarcoma that presents in the buttocks or thigh of young adults and often metastasizes to the brain. The present study examined the clinical features and morphology of brain metastatic ASPS. The case records of eight patients with brain metastatic ASPS admitted between November 2008 and March 2015 were reviewed. The relevant clinical data (including patient age and sex, neuroimaging studies, histopathological and immunohistochemical features, surgical records and follow-up reports) were collected through a review of patient records. The sex distribution was 3:1 male to female and the age ranged between 15 and 33 years at the time of surgery. In total, five patients with brain metastases had concurrent pulmonary metastases. The lesions were hypointense on T1-weighted images in every patient, hyperintense on T2-weighted images in six patients and contrast enhancement was present in all patients. The most notable immunohistochemical feature was strong immunohistochemical staining for TFE3 in each patient. Gross total resection was performed in all eight patients, with two patients undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy and one undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy. Four recurrent cases were observed during the follow-up. TFE3 staining and knowledge of its microscopic characteristics would facilitate earlier diagnosis: Early diagnosis with a multidisciplinary, multimodal approach to treatment is required to achieve extended disease-free survival in patients with brain metastatic ASPS.
