When retinas from dark-adapted C57BL/6 mice were incubated in the dark for 5 min at 37 degrees C in Earle's medium, they contained 80-120 pmol/mg protein of cGMP and about 13 pmol/mg protein of cAMP. When the incubation in darkness was in calcium-deficient Earle's medium with 3 mM EGTA, a 10-20 fold increase occurred in the cGMP level, peaking at 2- 3 min, but no change occurred in cAMP. This elevated level fell in 3 min to normal dark levels on return to normal Earle's medium, but was still about three times that of control levels after 15 min in EGTA- containing solution. Bright light after 2 min of dark incubation of dark-adapted retinas resulted in a 40-50% fall in cGMP, and bright light sharply reduced the elevated dark cGMP level of retinas in calcium-deficient media with 3 mM EDTA. However, no depression of normal dark levels of cGMP has thus far been obtained by increasing external calcium levels, even in the presence of the ionophore A23187. All the above phenomena involving dark cGMP levels and calcium are similar in Earle's medium with 100 mM of K+ substituted for Na+. Congenic rodless (rd/rd) mouse retinas have less than 5% of control cGMP and show only traces of calcium sensitivity. Thus, the above phenomena in controls are likely to be largely occurring in rods. The data suggest a dependency of the dark cGMP level on the calcium level, but that the light-induced fall in cGMP may largely be calcium insensitive.
