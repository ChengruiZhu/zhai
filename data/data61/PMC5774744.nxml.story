Severe asthma or therapy-resistant asthma in children is a heterogeneous disease that affects all age-groups. Given its heterogeneity, precision in diagnosis and treatment has become imperative, in order to achieve better outcomes. If one is thus able to identify specific patient phenotypes and endotypes using the appropriate biomarkers, it will assist in providing the patient with more personalized and appropriate treatment. However, there appears to be a huge diagnostic gap in severe asthma, as there is no single test yet that accurately determines disease phenotype. In this paper, we review the published literature on some of these biomarkers and their possible role in bridging this diagnostic gap. We also highlight the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in severe asthma, in order to show the basis for the novel biomarkers. Some markers useful for monitoring therapy and assessing airway remodeling in the disease are also discussed. A review of the literature was conducted with PubMed to gather baseline data on the subject. The literature search extended to articles published within the last 40 years. Although biomarkers specific to different severe asthma phenotypes have been identified, progress in their utility remains slow, because of several disease mechanisms, the variation of biomarkers at different levels of inflammation, changes in relying on one test over time (eg, from sputum eosinophilia to blood eosinophilia), and the degree of invasive tests required to collect biomarkers, which limits their applicability in clinical settings. In conclusion, several biomarkers remain useful in recognizing various asthma phenotypes. However, due to disease heterogeneity, identification and utilization of ideal and defined biomarkers in severe asthma are still inconclusive. The development of novel serum/sputum-based biomarker panels with enhanced sensitivity and specificity may lead to prompt diagnosis of the disease in the future.
