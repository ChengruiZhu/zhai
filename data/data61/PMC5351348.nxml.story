Feline sarcoma-related protein (Fer) is a nuclear and cytoplasmic non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase and Fer overexpression is associated with various biological processes. However, the clinicopathological characteristics and molecular mechanisms of Fer expression in bladder urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) have yet to be elucidated. The present study demonstrated that Fer was significantly upregulated in bladder UCC tissues and cell lines. A clinicopathological analysis suggested that Fer expression was significantly associated with tumor stage, histological grade and lymph node status, and Fer expression was a prognostic factor for overall survival in a multivariate analysis. Furthermore, small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to silence the expression of the Fer gene in human bladder UCC T24 cells, and was shown to significantly reduce the migration and invasion of the cells. It was also observed that Fer-siRNA caused the T24 cells to acquire an epithelial cobblestone phenotype, and was able to reverse the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of the cells. Subsequently, Fer-knockdown was shown to deactivate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/activator protein-1 signaling pathway in T24 cells. These results indicated, for the first time, that Fer has a critical role in bladder UCC progression and may be a potential therapeutic target for bladder UCC metastasis.
