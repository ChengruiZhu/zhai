Non-invasive blood-based molecule markers are evaluated as promising biomarkers these days. Here we investigated the potential of cell-free circulating DNA Integrity (cfDI) as blood-based marker for the prediction of recurrence during the follow-up of breast cancer patients within a prospective study cohort. cfDI was determined in plasma of 212 individuals, by measuring ALU and LINE1 repetitive DNA elements using quantitative PCR. A significant decrease of cfDI in recurrent breast cancer patients was observed. The group of patients who had impending recurrence during the follow-up had significant lower cfDI compared to the group of non-recurrent patients (P < 0.001 for ALU and LINE1 cfDI). cfDI could differentiate recurrent breast cancer patients from non-recurrent breast cancer subjects (area under the curve, AUC = 0.710 for ALU and 0.704 for LINE1). Univariate and multivariate analysis confirmed a significant association of recurrence and cfDI. Breast cancer patients with a lower cfDI had a much higher risk to develop recurrence than the patients with a higher cfDI (P = 0.020 for ALU cfDI and P = 0.019 for LINE1 cfDI, respectively). Further we show that cfDI is an independent predictor of breast cancer recurrence. In combination with other molecular markers, cfDI might be a useful biomarker for the prediction for breast cancer recurrence in clinic utility. We propose that cfDI might also be useful for the prediction of recurrence during the follow-up of other cancers.
