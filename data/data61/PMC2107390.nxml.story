 The neuronal perikarya of the grasshopper contain sudanophilic lipochondria which exhibit an affinity for vital dyes. These lipochondria are membrane-delimited and display acid phosphatase activity; hence they correspond to lysosomes. Unlike those of most vertebrates, these lysosomes also hydrolyze thiamine pyrophosphate and adenosine triphosphate. Like vertebrate lysosomal "dense bodies," they are electron-opaque and contain granular, vesicular, or lamellar material. Along with several types of smaller dense bodies, they are found in close spatial association with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi complexes are frequently arranged in concentric configurations within which these dense bodies lie. Some of the smaller dense bodies often lie close to or in association with the periphery of dense multivesicular bodies. Further, bodies occur that display gradations in structure between these multivesicular bodies and the dense lysosomes. Acid phosphatase activity is present in the small as well as the larger dense bodies, in the multivesicular bodies, and in some of the Golgi saccules, associated vesicles, and fenestrated membranes; thiamine pyrophosphatase is found in both the dense bodies and parts of the Golgi complex. The close spatial association of these organelles, together with their enzymatic similarities, suggests the existence of a functional or developmental relationship between them.
