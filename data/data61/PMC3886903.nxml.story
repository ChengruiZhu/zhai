 populations in chemostats. Using next generation sequencing and DNA microarrays, we identified all acquired genetic variation associated with increased fitness, in both individual lineages and entire populations. We find that amplification alleles that include nutrient transporter genes specific to the molecular form of the nitrogen present in the environment are a common mechanism underlying increased fitness. In addition, we identified a general strategy for adaptation to nitrogen-limited environments that entails remodeling of phospholipid biogenesis required for producing important cellular components including vacuoles and autophagosomes. More general strategies for adaptation to nutrient-limited environments point to a role for re-wiring of signaling pathways that coordinate cell growth with nutrient availability. We reconstructed the evolutionary dynamics of a population evolving in ammonium-limited conditions and find that a multi-locus genotype is repeatedly selected within the population and constrained by epistasis. We propose that this genotype constitutes a “gene network polymorphism (GNP),” which may be a common outcome of adaptive evolution. Our study suggests that when the selective pressure is understood the molecular basis of adaptive evolution in large microbial populations may be predicted with reasonable precision.
