Epidemiological studies provide useful information for clinical practice and investigations. This report aimed to determine glomerular diseases frequencies in a region of Morocco. All native renal biopsies (January 2000 to December 2007) on adults were reviewed, but only glomerular diseases were analyzed. The diagnosis of each case was based on histological, immunopathological and clinical features. We have performed 171 renal biopsies in 161 patients (101 males and 60 females), the mean age was (range) 40.4 ±15 years (16–72). Clinical indications that lead to renal biopsy were: nephrotic syndrome (60.3%), renal failure of unknown aetiology (31.6%), asymptomatic urinary abnormalities (6.2%) and nephritic syndrome(1.9%). Primary glomerular diseases were reported in 84 patients (52%). The most common histological lesion was minimal change disease (26%). Idiopathic membranous glomerulopathy was the second most common lesion (23%) followed by membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (17%), IgA nephropathy (12%), focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (9.4%) and crescentic glomerulonephritis (6%). Secondary glomerular diseases were reported in 53 patients (33%). Lupus nephritis was the secondary glomerular disease most frequent (45%) followed by amyloïdosis (19%), diabetic nephropathy (15%), and Good pasture's syndrome (7.6%). The most common complications of the procedure were pain at biopsy site in 4%, gross hematuria in 11.1%, perirenal hematoma in 5% and hematuria requiring nephrectomy in 0.6% patients. Minimal change disease was the most frequent primary glomerulopathy and lupus nephritis was the most frequent secondary glomerulopathy in our group. The reasons for these findings are unclear. This information is an important contribution to the understanding the prevalence of renal diseases in North Africa.
