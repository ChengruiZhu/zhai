Formation of cell polarity is a process of distributing cellular structures or molecules in an asymmetric manner. This process plays an important role in the generation of diverse cell forms and types. In plants, the quintessential hormone auxin is important for diverse physiological functions, including growth and development of cells and organs. To perform these functions, auxin must be transported and localized to specific regions within the plant. This is partially mediated by polar distribution of the PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin efflux transporters, which transport auxin outside of the cell and allow for the directional short- and long-distance transport of auxin throughout plant tissues and organs. Although auxin itself has been implicated as a signal to regulate PIN polar distribution, how auxin does so remains to be elucidated. We previously showed that auxin promotes the generation of “puzzle-piece” polarity in leaf epidermal pavement cells, which contain interdigitated lobes and indentations, by activating the ROP (Rho-like GTPases from plants) members of the conserved Rho family of small GTPases. Here, we find that auxin-dependent local activation of ROP2 in the lobe region inhibits PIN1 internalization into the endosomal compartments (or endocytosis), leaving higher levels of PIN1 polar distribution in the lobe region. PIN1 internalization is inhibited by altering the actin cytoskeleton through the ROP2 effector protein RIC4, a protein involved in cytoskeletal remodeling. On the basis of our findings, we propose that the Rho GTPase-mediated inhibition of endocytosis of PIN1 provides a self-organizing mechanism for the polar PIN1 distribution. Rho GTPase-based inhibition of endocytosis is also important for the formation of cell polarity in animal cells. Thus, we conclude that Rho GTPase signaling to inhibit endocytosis is a common mechanism for cell polarization in multicellular organisms.
