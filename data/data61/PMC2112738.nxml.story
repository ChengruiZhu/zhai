The mitogenic effects of brain and pituitary fibroblast growth factors (FGF) on vascular endothelial cells derived from either human umbilical vein or bovine aortic arch have been compared. Both brain and pituitary FGF are mitogenic for low density human umbilical endothelial (HUE) cell cultures maintained on either fibronectin- or laminin-coated dishes or on biomatrices produced by cultured cells such as bovine corneal endothelial cells or the teratocarcinoma cell line PF-HR-9. Pituitary FGF triggered the proliferation of HUE cells at concentrations as low as 0.25 ng/ml, with a half-maximal response at 0.55 ng/ml and optimal effect at 2.5 to 5 ng/ml. It was 50,000-fold more potent than commercial preparations of endothelial cell growth factor and 40 times more potent than commercial preparations of pituitary FGF. Similar results were observed when the effect of pituitary FGF was tested on low density cultures of adult bovine aortic endothelial cells. When the activity of brain and pituitary FGF on low density HUE cell cultures was compared, both mitogens were active. To confirm the presence in brain extract of both acidic and neutral, as well as of basic mitogen, for HUE cells, brain tissues were extracted at acidic (4.5), neutral (7.2), and basic (8.5) pH. The three types of extracts were equally potent in supporting the proliferation of either HUE or adult bovine aortic endothelial cells. When the various extracts were absorbed at pH 6.0 on a carboxymethyl Sephadex C-50 column, the neutral and basic extracts had an activity after adsorption similar to that of unadsorbed extracts. In contrast, extracts prepared at pH 4.5 lost 90-95% of their activity which was recovered in the adsorbed fraction containing FGF.
