The purpose of this cephalometric study was to evaluate the craniofacial changes induced by functional treatment of mandibular advancement with special regard to pharyngeal sagittal airway dimensions, tongue and hyoid bone position in subjects with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and dentoskeletal Class II malocclusions compared with an untreated Class II control group. 51 subjects (24 female, 27 male; mean age 9.9 ± 1.3 years) with Class II malocclusion and SDB consecutively treated with a functional appliance (Modify Monobloc, MM) were compared with a control group of 31 subjects (15 males, 16 females; mean age 10.1 ± 1.1) with untreated Class II malocclusion. For the study group, mode of breathing was defined by an otorhinolaryngologist according to complete physical examination. The parents of all participants completed a modified version of the paediatric sleep questionnaire, PSQ-SRBD Scale, by Ronald Chervin (the Italian version in 22 items form) before and after the trial. Lateral cephalograms were available at the start and end of treatment with the MM. Descriptive statistics were used for all cephalometric measurements in the two groups for active treatment changes. Significant, favourable skeletal changes in the mandible were observed in the treated group after T2. Significant short-term changes in sagittal airway dimensions, hyoid position and tongue position were induced by functional therapy of mandibular advancement in subjects with Class II malocclusion and SDB compared with untreated controls. After orthodontic treatment, a significant reduction in diurnal symptoms was observed in 45 of the 51 participants who had received an oral appliance. Orthodontic treatment is considered to be a potential therapeutic approach for SDB in children. Orthodontists are playing an increasingly important role in managing snoring and respiratory problems by oral mandibular advancement devices and rapid maxillary expansion.
