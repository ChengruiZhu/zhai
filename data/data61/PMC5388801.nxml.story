The identification of protein biomarkers for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that could find applications in AML diagnosis and prognosis, treatment and the selection for bone marrow transplant requires substantial comparative analyses of the proteomes from AML patients. In the past years, several studies have suggested some biomarkers for AML diagnosis or AML classification using methods for sample preparation with low proteome coverage and low resolution mass spectrometers. However, most of the studies did not follow up, confirm or validate their candidates with more patient samples. Current proteomics methods, new high resolution and fast mass spectrometers allow the identification and quantification of several thousands of proteins obtained from few tens of Î¼g of AML cell lysate. Enrichment methods for posttranslational modifications (PTM), such as phosphorylation, can isolate several thousands of site-specific phosphorylated peptides from AML patient samples, which subsequently can be quantified with high confidence in new mass spectrometers. While recent reports aiming to propose proteomic or phosphoproteomic biomarkers on the studied AML patient samples have taken advantage of the technological progress, the access to large cohorts of AML patients to sample from and the availability of appropriate control samples still remain challenging.
