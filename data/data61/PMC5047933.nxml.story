Pregnancy puts a significant additional strain on kidneys. The aim of our study was to investigate the impact of immunosuppressive drugs on changes in native kidneys in female Wistar rats after exposure during pregnancy. The study was conducted on 32 dams, subjected to immunosuppressive regimens commonly used in the therapy of human kidney transplant recipients (cyclosporine A, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone; tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone; cyclosporine A, everolimus and prednisone). The animals received drugs for 2 weeks before pregnancy and during 3 weeks of pregnancy. In all treated dams lower body weight (but not kidney mass) and alterations in serum sodium and chloride ions were found; serum creatinine concentration was increased in dams treated with cyclosporine A, everolimus and prednisone. All treatment groups of dams showed increased apoptosis in the distal tubules. In histological examination the changed intensity of acidophilic or basophilic cytoplasm of epithelial cells was found in kidneys of rats treated with calcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone. All immunosuppressive regimens caused abnormalities affecting nephron tubules. Regimens containing calcineurin inhibitors and mycophenolate mofetil caused higher rate of apoptosis and more pronounced histopathological changes. Regimen based on everolimus despite the lower rate of apoptosis in the proximal tubules and lower accumulation of kidney injury markers revealed higher serum creatinine concentration. Thus, interpretation which combination of drugs is better or worse for long-lasting functioning of kidneys in pregnant females requires further studies.
