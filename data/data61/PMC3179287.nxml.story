Osteoporosis, which contributes to morbidity and mortality, often coexists with cardiovascular disease, especially atherosclerosis. We have reported recently that in vitro exposure of human T-lymphocytes to oxidized lipids induced expression of a key osteoclastogenic cytokine, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL). Our previous studies have shown that mice fed an atherogenic high-fat diet developed osteopenia and that bone marrow preosteoclasts from these hyperlipidemic mice have increased osteoclastic potential. To investigate the role of T-lymphocytes in the diet-induced bone loss, C57BL/6 mice were fed either chow or a high-fat diet, and bone parameters and T-lymphocyte activation were assessed at 6 and 11 months. Consistent with our previous findings, peripheral quantitative computed tomographic (pQCT) analysis showed that mice in the high-fat group had lower bone mineral content than mice in the chow group. Furthermore, histomorphometric analysis showed decreased structural parameters in the high-fat group. Coculture studies showed that bone marrow cells isolated from the high-fat group, which contained increased levels of activated memory T-lymphocytes compared with bone marrow cells from the chow mice, supported osteoclastic differentiation of RAW 264.7 cells. Additionally, RANKL expression was upregulated significantly in the T-lymphocytes isolated from the bone marrow of the high-fat group. Splenic T-lymphocytes isolated from the high-fat group also had increased expression of transcripts for the receptor for oxidized lipids (LOX-1) as well as for inflammatory and osteoclastogenic cytokines, including RANKL, interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), IL-1β, and interferon γ (IFN-γ). Together these findings suggest that T-lymphocytes play a key role in the osteoclastogenesis induced by a high-fat diet and may contribute to the bone loss associated with diet-induced osteopenia. © 2010 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.
