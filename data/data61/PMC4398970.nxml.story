Proline oxidase (POX) is a novel mitochondrial tumor suppressor, which can suppress proliferation and induce apoptosis through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreasing hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) signaling. Recent studies have demonstrated the absent expression of POX in human cancer tissues, including renal cancer. However, the mechanism for the loss of POX remains obscure. No genetic or epigenetic variation of POX gene was found. Here, we identified the up-regulated miR-23b* in renal cancer as an important regulator of POX. Ectopic overexpression of miR-23b* in normal renal cells resulted in striking down-regulation of POX, while POX expression increased markedly when endogenous miR-23b* was knocked down by its antagomirs in renal cancer cells. Consistent with POX-mediated tumor suppression pathway, these antagomirs induced ROS, inhibited HIF signaling and increased apoptosis. Furthermore, we confirmed the regulation of miR-23b* on POX and its function in the DLD1 Tet-off POX cell system. Using a luciferase reporter system, we verified the direct binding of miR-23b* to POX mRNA 3â€²UTR. In addition, pairs of human renal carcinoma and normal tissues showed the negative correlation between miR-23b* and POX protein expression, providing its clinical corroboration. Taken together, our results suggested miR-23b*, by targeting POX, could function as an oncogene; decreasing miR-23b* expression may prove to be an effective way of inhibiting kidney tumor growth.
