Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is a rare, autoimmune small and medium vessel vasculitis. EGPA is accompanied by asthma and involves mainly the blood vessels of the lungs, gastrointestinal system, and peripheral nerves; however, the skin, kidneys, and heart may be also affected. To investigate if patients with EGPA experience reduced health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and the effect of this parameter on their own perception of future health outlook. Twenty-six EGPA patients are in disease remission and completed a custom-designed questionnaire and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF-36). Using the RAND method, eight HRQOL dimensions were calculated: general health, physical functioning, emotional role limitations, physical role limitations, social functioning, mental health, bodily pain, and vitality. Using norm-based scores, the HRQOL of patients was compared with that of the general population. EGPA patients had decreased HRQOL across all eight dimensions of the SF-36. Patients with higher mental component score felt more positive about their future health, while patients with low physical component score were likely not to feel negatively about their future health. Also, 36 % of older patients (>50 years) had a positive outlook compared to 47 % of younger patients (<50 years) and patients with a longer disease course were much less likely to have a positive outlook (30 % positive) than those with a shorter course (50 % positive). Although not statistically significant, these correlations warrant further investigation with a larger patient population. Despite being in disease remission, EGPA patients had decreased quality of life, which in turn influenced their perception of their future health outlook.
