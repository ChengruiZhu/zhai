Cell surface receptors translate extracellular ligand concentrations to intracellular responses. Receptor transport between the plasma membrane and other cellular compartments regulates the number of accessible receptors at the plasma membrane that determines the strength of downstream pathway activation at a given ligand concentration. In cell populations, pathway activation strength and cellular responses vary between cells. Understanding origins of cell-to-cell variability is highly relevant for cancer research, motivated by the problem of fractional killing by chemotherapies and development of resistance in subpopulations of tumor cells. The erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) is a characteristic example of a receptor system that strongly depends on receptor transport processes. It is involved in several cellular processes, such as differentiation or proliferation, regulates the renewal of erythrocytes, and is expressed in several tumors. To investigate the involvement of receptor transport processes in cell-to-cell variability, we quantitatively characterized trafficking of EpoR in individual cells by combining live-cell imaging with mathematical modeling. Thereby, we found that EpoR dynamics was strongly dependent on rapid receptor transport and turnover. Interestingly, although transport processes largely differed between individual cells, receptor concentrations in cellular compartments were robust to variability in trafficking processes due to the correlated kinetics of opposing transport processes.
