Activation of Toll-like receptors (TLR) induces gene expression of proteins involved in the immune system response. TLR4 has been implicated in the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases. Innate and adaptive immunity contribute to hypertension-associated end-organ damage, although the mechanism by which this occurs remains unclear. In the present study we hypothesize that inhibition of TLR4 decreases blood pressure and improves vascular contractility in resistance arteries from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). TLR4 protein expression in mesenteric resistance arteries was higher in 15 weeks-old SHR than in same age Wistar controls or in 5 weeks-old SHR. In order to decrease activation of TLR4, 15 weeks-old SHR and Wistar rats were treated with anti-TLR4 antibody or non-specific IgG control antibody for 15 days (1Âµg per day, i.p.). Treatment with anti-TLR4 decreased mean arterial pressure as well as TLR4 protein expression in mesenteric resistance arteries and interleukin-6 (IL-6) serum levels from SHR when compared to SHR treated with IgG. No changes in these parameters were found in Wistar treated rats. Mesenteric resistance arteries from anti-TLR4-treated SHR exhibited decreased maximal contractile response to noradrenaline compared to IgG-treated-SHR. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 (Cox) and Cox-2, enzymes related to inflammatory pathways, decreased noradrenaline responses only in mesenteric resistance arteries of SHR treated with IgG.
