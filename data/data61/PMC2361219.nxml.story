Lipids such as cholesterol and triglycerides, which are synthesized in the body or taken up by food, are indispensable for each cell of the human body. They are transported in blood plasma among the various tissues by so-called lipoproteins, which differ in size as well as in their composition of lipids and proteins. Changes in the amount of certain lipoprotein fractions are considered a major risk factor for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases (CVD)—the main cause of death in the western states. To identify patients at risk for CVD, major lipoprotein classes (“bad” LDL, “good” HDL) are routinely monitored in clinical practice (which equals the lipoprotein profile). In this paper, we present a mathematical model that allows us to calculate lipoprotein profiles by computer and to simulate how the numerous biochemical processes involved in the metabolism of plasma lipoproteins influence the lipoprotein profile. Our simulations successfully reproduce clinically measured lipoprotein profiles of healthy subjects and patients with a defined lipid disorder (dyslipidemia). Calculation of a lipoprotein profile that fits best to the profile measured in individual patients opens the possibility of diagnosing potential molecular causes for dyslipidemia. The results of our model calculations also suggest the existence of lipoprotein sub-fractions which hitherto remained unrecognized in routinely performed separation of lipoprotein fractions. If this finding could be validated in forthcoming experimental investigations, it might help to define better patient-specific risk predictors of CVD.
