 environment, while the 3D scaffolds are more reflective of this. Osteopontin (Opn) secreted by bone marrow osteoblasts, may participate in protecting leukemia cells from apoptosis by binding to its receptor αvβ3, which can be expressed on the surface of the leukemia MV4–11 cell line. However, the association between the Opn/αvβ3 axis and leukemia cells is unknown. In the present study, experiments were conducted on 3D polystyrene scaffolds coated with osteoblasts and leukemia cells. The cells were exposed to cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-d-Phe-Val) [c(RGDfV)] (35 nmol/ml), which blocks αvβ3, for a period of 24 h. Cytarabine was applied 24 h later. The adhesion, migration and apoptosis rates, and the cell cycle of the leukemia cells were analyzed after incubation for 24 and 48 h. In contrast to the 2D culture system, the stromal cells in the scaffolds secreted significantly more alkaline phosphatase and Opn (P<0.05). c(RGDfV) disrupted the adhesion and migration between the tumor cells and the matrix, induced the leukemia cells to leave the protective microenvironment and increased their sensitivity to cell cycle-dependent agents (P<0.05). In summary, the data certified that the 3D scaffolds are suitable for the growth of cells, and that c(RGDfV) inhibits the adhesion and migration abilities of leukemia cells in the endosteal niche. Therefore, blocking the function of Opn may be beneficial in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.
