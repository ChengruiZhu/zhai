The α′ and β subunits of soybean β-conglycinin were expressed in rice seeds in order to improve the nutritional and physiological properties of rice as a food. The α′ subunit accumulated in rice seeds at a higher level than the β subunit, but no detectable difference in mRNA transcription level between subunits was observed. Sequential extraction results indicate that the α′ subunit formed one or more disulphide bonds with glutelin. Electron microscopic analysis showed that the α′ subunit and the β subunit were transported to PB-II together with glutelin. In mature transgenic seeds, the β subunit accumulated in low electron density regions in the periphery of PB-II, whereas the α′ subunit accumulated together with glutelin in high-density regions of the periphery. The subcellular localization of mutated α′ subunits lacking one cysteine residue in the N-terminal mature region (α′ΔCys1) or five cysteine residues in the pro and N-terminal mature regions (α′ΔCys5) were also examined. Low-density regions were formed in PB-II in mature seeds of transgenic rice expressing α′ΔCys 5 and α′ΔCys1. α′ΔCys5 was localized only in the low-density regions, whereas α′ΔCys1 was found in both low- and high-density regions. These results suggest that the α′ subunit could make a complex via one or more disulphide bonds with glutelin and accumulate together in PB-II of transgenic rice seeds.
