Chromatin, like many other molecular biological systems, is composed of multiple interacting factors. Our knowledge about chromatin factors is mostly qualitative, and such qualitative knowledge can be insufficient for predicting collective behaviors. It's also extremely challenging to study collective behaviors involving multiple interacting factors through genetic and biochemical experiments. An alternative approach is to leverage large-scale genome-wide chromatin profiles and statistical modeling to create predictive models and infer underlying interaction mechanisms based on these observed high-throughput data. In this study, we developed a novel maximum entropy-based modeling approach to quantitatively capture interactions between chromatin factors at the same genomic location, which we see as a step toward quantitative understanding of chromatin organization that involves a system of multiple interacting factors. We applied this quantitative model to successfully infer functional properties of chromatin including interactions between chromatin factors. Furthermore, the model predicts unmeasured chromatin profiles with high accuracy based on its inferred dependencies with other factors within and across cell-types. Thus our modeling approach effectively ultilizes large-scale chromatin profiles to dissect chromatin factor interactions and to make data-driven inferences about chromatin regulation.
