Most kidney cancers are renal cell carcinomas (RCC). RCC lacks early warning signs and 70 % of patients with RCC develop metastases. Among them, 50 % of patients having skeletal metastases developed a dismal survival of less than 10 % at 5 years. Therefore, exploring the key driving proteins and pathways involved in RCC bone metastasis could benefit patients’ therapy and prolong their survival. We examined the difference between the OS-RC-2 cells and the OS-RC-2-BM5 cells (subpopulation from OS-RC-2) of RCC with proteomics. Then we employed Western-blot, immunohistochemistry and the clinical database (oncomine) to screen and verify the key proteins and then we analyzed the functions and the related pathways of selected key proteins with system biology approaches. Our proteomic data revealed 26 significant changed spots (fold change <0.5 and >1.9, P < 0.05) between two cells. The Western blotting results validated for these identified spots were consistent with the proteomics’. From the public clinical database, 23 out of 26 proteins were connected with RCC metastases and 9 out of 23 with survival time directly (P < 0.05). Finally, only 8 out of 9 proteins had significantly positive results in tissues of RCC patients with bone metastasis compared with primary tumor (P < 0.05). System biology analyzing results showed these eight proteins mainly distributed in oxidative phosphorylation which indicates that mitochondria dysfunction played the critical role to regulate cells metastasis. Our article used a variety of experimental techniques to find eight proteins which abnormally regulated mitochondrial function to achieve a successful induction for RCC metastasis to bone.
