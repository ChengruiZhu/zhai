The aim of this study was to analyze and report sites and patterns of obstruction observed during sleep endoscopy in a large group of patients and suggest consequent therapeutic prescriptions. 614 consecutive patients who approached the Centre for Diagnosis and Treatment of Respiratory Sleep Disorders underwent sleep endoscopy. We used propofol to induce sleep, monitoring the value of bispectral index to evaluate the depth of sedation. For each patient, we recorded obstruction sites,obstruction patterns and the effects of the mandibular pull-up manoeuvre on both obstruction and snoring. We ascertained that, in almost all patients, the noise of snoring was generated at the oropharyngeal level. The obstruction at the oropharyngeal level, either in isolation or in combination with other structures, is far more common. The mandibular pull-up manoeuvre was effective in reducing or resolving the obstruction in a large number of patients, even though their AHI values were high. For those patients having an AHI over 15, we point out the various therapeutic indications gained from the sleep endoscopy examinations. Drug-induced (propofol) sleep endoscopy can be considered be a safe procedure, easily practicable, valid and reliable; we therefore consider it a fundamental clinical investigation that can be essential when choosing treatment.
