The present study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of Tat-interacting protein 30 (HTATIP2/TIP30) levels alone and in combination with α-fetoprotein (AFP) for the evaluation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. ELISA and immunohistochemical measurements on the serum and tissue of HTATIP2/TIP30 protein from HCC patients and normal controls were made. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses of AFP and HTATIP2/TIP30 were performed, as well as logistic regression analysis of APF combined with HTATIP2/TIP30. Log-rank analysis was used to correlate the prognosis with various levels of HTATIP2/TIP30. HTATIP2/TIP30 levels were significantly lower in the HCC group compared with the control group (4.50±2.63 vs. 9.50±2.04 ng/ml, P<0.001). ROC analysis revealed an optimal cut-off point at 7.27 ng/ml HTATIP2/TIP30 for separating the HCC from the control groups. The sensitivity and specificity were 84.6 and 93.7% (P<0.001), respectively. ROC areas of HTATIP2/TIP30 (0.928, P<0.001) were significantly higher than those for AFP (P<0.001). The area under the curve of the HTATIP2/TIP30 and AFP combination was 0.950 (P<0.001). Log-rank tests revealed that the recurrence-free survival time of the group with HTATIP2/TIP30>5.71 ng/ml was significantly higher than that of the control group (P<0.001). This is the first study to demonstrate that HTATIP2/TIP30 levels in serum may be an effective biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of HCC.
