Neuroimaging is a key element in the management of patients suffering from subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). In this article, we review the current literature to provide a summary of the existing neuroimaging methods available in clinical practice. Noncontrast computed tomography is highly sensitive in detecting subarachnoid blood, especially within 6Â hours of haemorrhage. However, lumbar puncture should follow a negative noncontrast computed tomography scan in patients with symptoms suspicious of SAH. Computed tomography angiography is slowly replacing digital subtraction angiography as the first-line technique for the diagnosis and treatment planning of cerebral aneurysms, but digital subtraction angiography is still required in patients with diffuse SAH and negative initial computed tomography angiography. Delayed cerebral ischaemia is a common and serious complication after SAH. The modern concept of delayed cerebral ischaemia monitoring is shifting from modalities that measure vessel diameter to techniques focusing on brain perfusion. Lastly, evolving modalities applied to assess cerebral physiological, functional and cognitive sequelae after SAH, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging or positron emission tomography, are discussed. These new techniques may have the advantage over structural modalities due to their ability to assess brain physiology and function in real time. However, their use remains mainly experimental and the literature supporting their practice is still scarce.
