The purpose of the study was to investigate the role of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), signal transduction protein in regulating the biological characteristics of stem cells in cervical carcinoma. Overexpressed plasmid of STAT3 was constructed and used to transfect SiHa into cervical carcinoma cells. STAT3-targeted specific siRNA was designed and produced. The effects of STAT3 upregulation (or inhibition) on the expression of NANOG, OCT4 and SOX2 markers of stem cells were measured, using western blot analysis and RT-qPCR. In addition, the tumor sphere experiment was also conducted to detect the formation of tumor spheres after the intervention of expression of STAT3 and the expression of STAT3, NANOG, OCT4 and SOX2 was detected in 35 cases of cervical carcinoma tissues and 31 cases of normal cervical tissues using immunohistochemistry. We determined whether the STAT3 overexpression plasmid was successfully constructed using enzyme digestion, PCR for bacterium solution, western blot analysis and RT-qPCR and found that the plasmid met the requirements of subsequent procedures. Compared with the empty plasmid group and STAT3 low expression group, the mRNA and protein expression of markers of stem cells, OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG were significantly elevated in the STAT3 overexpression group with statistically significant differences (P<0.05), the formation ratio of tumor spheres in the STAT3 overexpression group was also significantly higher than those in the other two groups (P<0.05). The positive expression of STAT3, OCT4, NANOG and SOX2 in the cervical squamous carcinoma group was also markedly higher than that in the chronic cervicitis group (P<0.05). This study led us to a conclusion that STAT3 can regulate the characteristics of stem cells in cervical carcinoma, and STAT3, NANOG, OCT4 and SOX2 are highly expressed in cervical squamous carcinoma, thus able to promote the progression of cervical carcinoma.
