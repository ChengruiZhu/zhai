Topical corticosteroids are routinely used as postoperative ocular anti-inflammatory drugs; however, adverse effects such as increased intraocular pressure (IOP) are observed with their use. While older corticosteroids such as dexamethasone and prednisolone acetate offer good anti-inflammatory efficacy, clinically significant increases in IOP (≥10 mmHg) are often associated with their use. Loteprednol etabonate, a novel C-20 ester-based corticosteroid, was retrometabolically designed to offer potent anti-inflammatory efficacy but with decreased impact on IOP. After exerting its therapeutic effects on the site of action, loteprednol etabonate is rapidly converted to inactive metabolites, resulting in fewer adverse effects. Randomized controlled studies have demonstrated the clinical efficacy and safety of loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension 0.5 % for the treatment of postoperative inflammation in post-cataract patients with few patients, if any, exhibiting clinically significant increases (≥10 mmHg) in IOP. Furthermore, safety studies demonstrated a minimal effect of loteprednol etabonate on IOP with long-term use or in steroid responders with a much lower propensity to increase IOP relative to prednisolone acetate or dexamethasone. The anti-inflammatory treatment effect of loteprednol etabonate appears to be similar to that of rimexolone and difluprednate with less impact on IOP compared to difluprednate, although confirmatory comparative studies are needed. The available clinical data suggest that loteprednol etabonate is an efficacious and safe corticosteroid for the treatment of postoperative inflammation.
