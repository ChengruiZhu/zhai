Hyponatremia presents with various central nervous system symptoms during its course and treatment. We treated a patient who presented with a prolonged consciousness disorder and was suspected of having complications of neuroleptic malignant syndrome and osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) during the treatment for his hyponatremia, which was caused by syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). The patient was a 30-year-old Japanese man who had been under treatment for schizophrenia. He presented with profound hyponatremia (96Â mEq/L) and a consciousness disorder. Because he was taking a number of antipsychotic drugs and since psychogenic polydipsia was present along with laboratory findings, the patient was diagnosed with SIADH. However, the consciousness disorder reappeared after his serum sodium concentrations were normalized, and it persisted over a long period. Although ODS was suspected from the clinical course and imaging findings, there were several inconsistencies, such as the lack of quadriplegia. The patient also showed muscular rigidity and fever, and we, therefore, diagnosed complications of malignant hyperthermia syndrome caused by the discontinuation of all antipsychotic drugs at the time of onset. There have been no reports of complications of these two conditions, and we report this case for its clinically valuable information.
