Serum miRNAs have gained great popularity to act as circulating biomarkers of several cancers. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic efficiency of serum miR-21 as novel biomarkers for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other controls. A total of 533 individuals were recruited and conducted in a two-step analysis. The pilot group included 40 HCC patients and 40 healthy donors. The expression levels of miR-21 were significantly higher in primary HCC tissues than in adjacent noncancerous tissues (P<0.0001). HCC patients exhibited significantly higher serum levels of miR-21 than HD (P<0.0001). In the verification group, the mean serum levels of miR-21 in 175 patients with HCC were significantly higher than in 64 with CHB, 78 with LC and 136 HD (all P<0.0001). ROC curves demonstrated that the AUC of miR-21 was 0.849, sensitivity 82.1% and specificity 83.9%. Furthermore, serum miR-21 maintained its diagnostic efficiency in AFP-negative HCC subgroups with AUC 0.831, sensitivity 81.2% and specificity 83.2%. The serum levels of miR-21 could distinguish HCC from CHB and LC (AUC 0.789, sensitivity 76.9%, specificity 85.7% and AUC 0.814, sensitivity 80.8%, specificity 72.9%, respectively). In addition, the serum levels of miR-21 were significantly associated with clinical stage (P=0.006) and distant metastasis (P=0.000). Thus, our findings suggest that miR-21 together with AFP may help enhance the diagnosis of HCC, especially of AFP-negative HCC, and could distinguish HCC from CHB and LC.
