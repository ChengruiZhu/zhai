The analysis of dynamic multileaf collimator (MLC) positions for the delivered intensity‐modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) plans is crucial in that it may capture dose delivery problems otherwise difficult to observe and quantify in the conventional dosimetric measurements with film or with an ionization chamber. In some IMRT systems, delivery of IMRT fields starts with a maximum MLC opening (roughly the shape of the target in the beam's‐eye view) and then proceeds to the subsequent dynamic MLC subfields. No irradiation is required in going from the initial segment (maximum opening) to the next one, and theoretically, no dose should be delivered in that initial moment. However, due to a finite sampling time of the MLC controller, the finite speed of the MLC, and a finite leaf tolerance, there may be some dose delivered between the first and the second segment. The amount of the excess dose is higher for larger dose rates and for a smaller number of the total monitor units per IMRT field. The magnitude of the dose errors could be in the order of a few percent. Effects similar to the maximum MLC opening may occur in other situations as well, for instance, when leaves are forced to move over large distances in a short time. Confounding this are dose errors due to the uncertainty in the MLC transmission. The analysis of the actual leaf positions recorded in the dynamic MLC log file is helpful in differentiating between the two types of errors and in determining the optimal dynamic MLC delivery parameters.
