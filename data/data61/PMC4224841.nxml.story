Most enrolled patients (71%) were female. At baseline median CD4 cell count was 162/µL (IQR 59-259), median log10 VL was 5.4 (IQR 5.0–5.8) c/mL, and one-third of patients had World Health Organisation (WHO) stage 3 or 4; 30 patients died during follow-up. Among all patients who completed follow-up 38/238 had virologic failure. These patients were younger, had lower CD4 cell counts and more often had WHO stage 3 or 4 at baseline compared to patients with VL<1000c/mL. Sixty-three percent of failing patients (24/38) had at least one mutation associated with high-level drug resistance. The M184V mutation was the most frequently detected nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) mutation (n=18) followed by TAMs (n=5) and multi-NRTI resistance mutations (n=4). The most commonly observed non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance mutations were K103N (n=10), Y181C (n=7), and G190A (n=6). Drug resistance mutations at baseline were detected in 12/65 (18%) patients, in 6 patients with and 6 patients without virological failure (p=0.77). Subtherapeutic NNRTI levels (OR 6.67, 95% CI 1.98–22.43, p<0.002) and poorer adherence (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.00–2.39, p=0.05) were each associated with higher risk of virologic failure in the matched pair analysis. Unavailability of ART at the treatment centre was the single most common cause (37%) for incomplete adherence in these patients.
