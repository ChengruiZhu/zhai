mol/L glycochenodeoxycholic acid and deoxycholic acid) in an acid medium (pH 5.5) for 10 min daily for 60 weeks to develop an MGC803‐resistant cell line. Control MGC803 cells were grown without acids or bile salts for 60 weeks as a control. Cell morphology, proliferation, colony formation and apoptosis of MGC803‐resistant cells were analyzed after 60 weeks. To determine the involvement of c‐Myc in tumor progression and telomere aging in MGC803‐resistant cells, we generated xenografts in nude mice and measured xenograft volume and in vivo telomerase activity. The c‐Myc and hTERT protein and mRNA levels were significantly higher in local recurrent gastric cancer samples than in primary gastric cancer samples. MGC803‐resistant cells showed a marked phenotypic change under normal growth conditions with more clusters and acini, and exhibited increased cell viability and colony formation and decreased apoptosis in vitro. These phenotypic changes were found to be dependent on c‐Myc activation using the c‐Myc inhibitor 10058‐F4. MGC803‐resistant cells also showed a c‐Myc‐dependent increase in xenograft growth and telomerase activity in vivo. In conclusion, these observations support the hypothesis that acidified bile acids enhance tumor progression and telomerase activity in gastric cancer and that these effects are dependent on c‐Myc activity. These findings suggest that acidified bile acids play an important role in the malignant progression of local recurrent gastric cancer.
