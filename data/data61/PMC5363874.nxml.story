 model. 3-HT suppressed proliferation and caused cytotoxicity against A2780/CP70 and OVCAR-3 cells, while it exhibited lower cytotoxicity in IOSE-364 cells. Subsequently, we found that 3-HT induced S phase arrest and apoptosis in a dose-independent manner. Further investigation revealed that S phase arrest was related with DNA damage which mediated the ATM/p53/Chk2 pathway. Downregulation of cyclin D1, cyclin A2, cyclin E1, CDK2, CDK4 and Cdc25C, and the upregulation of Cdc25A and cyclin B1 led to the accumulation of cells in S phase. The apoptotic effect was confirmed by Hoechst 33342 staining, depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of cleaved caspase-3 and PARP1. Additional results revealed both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways were involved. The intrinsic apoptotic pathway was activated through decreasing the protein levels of Bcl2, Bcl-xL and procaspase-9 and increasing the protein level of Puma. The induction of DR5 and DR4 indicated that the extrinsic apoptotic pathway was also activated. Induction of ROS and activation of ERK were observed in ovarian cancer cells. We therefore concluded that 3-HT possessed anti-proliferative effect on A2780/CP70 and OVCAR-3 cells, induced S phase arrest and caused apoptosis. Taken together, we propose that 3-HT shows promise as a therapeutic candidate for treating ovarian cancer.
