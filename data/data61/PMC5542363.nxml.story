Soft tissue allograft ACL reconstruction was performed in nine mini-pigs using cortical screw post fixation. A collagen scaffold was added to the terminus of each tendon graft limb contained within the corresponding bone tunnel. On post-operative day 14, a lipid microsphere solution containing DNA encoding either green fluorescence protein (GFP, n=3 pigs) or BMP-6 (n=6 pigs) was delivered into the bone tunnels percutaneously under fluoroscopic guidance. The bone tunnels in the US treated group were then immediately treated with a transcutaneous US energy pulse at the site of the bone tunnels, whereas the control group did not receive US delivery. At five days post-treatment the cells occupying the bone tunnels of the GFP treated pigs (n=3) were harvested and subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis to assess for expression of GFP as well as known mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) markers (CD29, CD44, CD90). Six weeks post-treatment the BMP/US treated pigs (n=3) and control pigs (n=3) were sacrificed and their knee joints were scanned using microCT. Biomechanical testing of anterior-posterior (AP) knee laxity was performed via application of sinusoidal AP-directed shear loads for 12 cycles. Load to failure was assessed by removal of the joint capsule, menisci, collateral ligaments, and the PCL leaving only the ACL graft intact. The tibia and femur were then mounted on a universal material testing machine with a 5kN load cell and distracted until failure of the ACL graft or graft-bone interface.
