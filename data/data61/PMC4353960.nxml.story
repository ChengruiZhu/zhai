Central giant tumors commonly occur in long bones. In the oral and maxillofacial region, a counterpart coined with the term Central giant cell granuloma exists. Choung and Kaban classified central giant cell granulomas based on clinical and radiographic findings. The classification includes aggressive and non-aggressive variants. However, to date there has been no molecular method of distinguishing the variants. Different lines of treatment had been reported. The aggressive form showed high recurrence rates with conservative surgical treatment. Intra-lesional steroid, calcitonin, interferon, bisphosphonates and denosumab; have been administered as a treatment lines. Several reports support the injection of intra lesional steroids and its successful outcome. An Egyptian, nine years old female presented with a facial swelling affecting lower left side of the mandible. Biopsy confirmed it to be a CGCG. The treatment plan was intralesional steroid injections to avoid resection of the mandible. The treatment showed acceptable progress but was associated with cushinoid appearance of patient. This forced the operating team to halt the steroid injections and resolute to adjunctive surgical curettage yet sparing the mandible from resection. One-year follow up showed no recurrence, however, the patient still suffers mild cushinoid appearance.
