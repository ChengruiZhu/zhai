 metabolism of plasma LDL (low-density lipoprotein) particles in humans and, based on them, to reconstruct our understanding of the governance of the concentration of plasma LDL and the maintenance of cholesterol homoeostasis in the hepatocyte. We believe that regulation of cholesterol homoeostasis within the hepatocyte is demonstrably more complex than envisioned by the LDL receptor paradigm, the conventional model to explain the regulation of plasma LDL and the fluxes of cholesterol into the liver, a model which was generated in the fibroblast but has never been fully validated in the hepatocyte. We suggest that the LDL receptor paradigm should be reconfigured as the apoB (apolipoprotein B) paradigm, which states that the rate at which LDL particles are produced is at least an important determinant of their concentration in plasma as the rate at which they are cleared from plasma and that secretion of cholesterol within VLDL (very-low-density lipoprotein) particles is an important mechanism of maintaining cholesterol homoeostasis within the hepatocyte. These two paradigms are not mutually exclusive. The LDL receptor paradigm, however, includes only one critical aspect of the regulation of plasma LDL, namely the rate at which LDL particles are cleared through the LDL receptor pathway, but ignores another â€“ the rate at which LDL particles are added to the plasma compartment. The apoB paradigm includes both and points to a different model of how the hepatocyte achieves cholesterol homoeostasis in a complex metabolic environment.
