Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized our approach to genomic research. The use of whole genome sequencing (WGS), whole exome sequencing (WES), transcriptome profiling, and targeted DNA sequencing has exponentially improved our understanding of the human genome and the genetic complexities underlying malignancy. Yet, WGS and WES clinical applications remain limited due to high costs and the large volume of data generated. When utilized to address biological questions in basic science studies, targeted sequencing panels have proven extremely valuable due to reduced costs and higher sequencing depth. However, the routine application of targeted sequencing to the clinical setting is limited to a few cancer subtypes. Some highly aggressive tumor types, like type 2 endometrial cancer (EC), could greatly benefit from routine genomic analysis using targeted sequencing. To explore the potential utility of a mid size panel (~150 genes) in the clinical setting, we developed and validated a custom panel against WGS, WES, and another commercially available targeted panel. Our results indicate that a mid size custom designed panel is as efficient as WGS and WES in mapping variants of biological and clinical relevance, rendering higher coverage, at a lower cost, with fewer variants of uncertain significance. Because of the much higher sequencing depth that could be achieved, our results demonstrate that targeted sequencing outperformed WGS and WES in the mapping of pathogenic variants in a breast cancer case, as well as a case of mixed serous and high-grade endometrioid EC, the most aggressive EC subtype.
