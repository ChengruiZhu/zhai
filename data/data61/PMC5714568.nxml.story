Previously we have shown that our routine portal imaging (PI) of the craniofacial region in pediatric brain tumor patients contributed an additional 2%‐3% of the prescribed dose and up to 200 cGy to the planning target volume (PTV) and nearby organs at risk (OARs). The purpose of this study is to quantify the reduction in dose to PTV and OARs from portal imaging (PI) of the craniofacial region of pediatric patients treated after the implementation of changes in our portal imaging practices. Twenty consecutive pediatric patients were retrospectively studied since the implementation of changes to our portal imaging procedure. Each received portal imaging of treatment fields and orthogonal setup fields to the craniofacial region. PI modifications included a reduction in the field size of setup orthogonal fields without loss of radiographic information needed for treatment verification. In addition, treatment fields were imaged using a single exposure, rather than double exposure. Dose‐volume histograms were generated to quantify the dose to the target and critical structures through PI acquisition. These results were compared with our previous cohort of 20 patients who were treated using the former portal imaging practices. The mean additional target dose from portal imaging following the new guidelines was 1.5% of the prescribed dose compared to 2.5% prior to the new portal image practices
