The human brain is equipped with a number of modulatory neurotransmitter systems, which have widespread projections and regulate global brain states. Disturbances of these systems are implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, but how they modulate specific neural computations to shape perception, cognition, and behavior remains unknown. Here, we combined pharmacological interventions with electrophysiological and behavioral measurements to investigate the impact of two classes of such neuromodulatory systems—catecholamines and acetylcholine—on the variability of the activity of neuronal populations in the cerebral cortex and on cognition in humans. We addressed a prominent hypothesis, which holds that noradrenaline—a catecholamine—boosts the variability of inference and decision-making to promote exploration of alternative options—for example, exploring distinct perceptual interpretations of an ambiguous sensory input. Pharmacologically elevating catecholamine levels, but not acetylcholine levels, altered the temporal structure of intrinsic variability of population activity in two cortical regions and increased the rate of spontaneous perceptual alternations induced by ambiguous visual stimulation, in line with an increase in exploration. Computational modeling revealed that the observed changes can be explained by an increase in the ratio between excitation and inhibition in the circuits processing the stimulus.
