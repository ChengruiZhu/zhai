Pulse rate variability (PRV) is a promising physiological and analytic technique used as a substitute for heart rate variability (HRV). PRV is measured by pulse wave from various devices including mobile and wearable devices but HRV is only measured by an electrocardiogram (ECG). The purpose of this study was to evaluate PRV and HRV at various ambient temperatures and elaborate on the interchangeability of PRV and HRV. Twenty-eight healthy young subjects were enrolled in the experiment. We prepared temperature-controlled rooms and recorded the ECG and photoplethysmography (PPG) under temperature-controlled, constant humidity conditions. The rooms were kept at 17, 25, and 38 °C as low, moderate, and high ambient temperature environments, respectively. HRV and PRV were derived from the synchronized ECG and PPG measures and they were studied in time and frequency domain analysis for PRV/HRV ratio and pulse transit time (PTT). Similarity and differences between HRV and PRV were determined by a statistical analysis. PRV/HRV ratio analysis revealed that there was a significant difference between HRV and PRV for a given ambient temperature; this was with short-term variability measures such as SDNN SDSD or RMSSD, and HF-based variables including HF, LF/HF and normalized HF. In our analysis the absolute value of PTT was not significantly influenced by temperature. Standard deviation of PTT, however, showed significant difference not only between low and moderate temperatures but also between low and high temperatures. Our results suggest that ambient temperature induces a significant difference in PRV compared to HRV and that the difference becomes greater at a higher ambient temperature.
