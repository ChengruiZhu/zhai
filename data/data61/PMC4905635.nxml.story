Computational modeling combined with experimental validation may give insight into structural and functional properties of protein systems. The basic Helix-Loop-Helix PER-ARNT-SIM (bHLH-PAS) proteins show conserved functional domains despite the broad range of functions exerted by the different systems. Within this protein family, the Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) is known to mediate the toxic effects of a number of environmental contaminants, including dioxins and dioxin-like chemicals, and it also exerts other biochemical and physiological effects. Despite the absence of experimentally determined structures, theoretical models of the AhR PAS domains developed on the basis of homologous systems have allowed understanding of some aspects of the molecular mechanisms underlying its function. In this work we present alternative structural models of the transcriptionally active complex of AhR with the AhR Nuclear Translocator (ARNT) protein. Computational characterization of the modeled protein-protein interaction interfaces guided the design of mutagenesis experiments, and evaluation of the DNA binding ability of the resulting AhR:ARNT dimer mutants allowed validation of the models and selection of the most reliable one. These findings open new research directions for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the functional activity of the AhR.
