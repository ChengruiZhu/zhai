Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent across all age groups in epidemic proportions. The purpose of this study was to acquire a baseline assessment and create awareness among medical students regarding vitamin D. A cross-sectional, voluntary survey was conducted among undergraduate medical students. Data were collected using a questionnaire which assessed the level of knowledge students had with regard to where vitamin D comes from, what it does for health, how much is recommended, factors that affect its levels, and deficiency management. Majority of students were unaware that vitamin D deficiency has attained epidemic proportions. Though bone and skeletal disorders as a complication of vitamin D deficiency were known, a large number were unaware of systemic consequences (diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and cancers). Only one-third of respondents were aware of duration and timing of sun exposure required for adequate serum vitamin D levels. However, we observed lack of awareness among students regarding the various biochemical forms, dose, and duration of vitamin D supplementation for treatment of nutritional deficiency. Our study highlighted a lack of knowledge about the importance of vitamin D, worldwide prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, and its management among medical students. Promoting vitamin D health awareness, if replicated across populations, could lead to positive health outcomes globally.
