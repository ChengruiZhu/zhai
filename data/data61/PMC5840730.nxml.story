To investigate the effects of taurine on cell proliferation and apoptosis, the human lung cancer A549 cell line and xenograft tumors in nude mice were used. The effects of taurine on cell proliferation and apoptosis were observed at time points of 24, 48 and 72 h after treatment using an MTT assay to detect the survival rate, and flow cytometry to detect the apoptotic rate. Western blot analysis was performed to examine the levels of p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), BCL2, apoptosis regulator (Bcl-2) and BCL2-associated X, apoptosis regulator (Bax) in A549 cells. The level of PUMA, Bax and Bcl-2 proteins in the mouse xenograft tumors treated with taurine and/or exogenous PUMA were assessed by immunohistochemistry, with taurine suppressing the proliferation of the human lung cancer A549 cell line in a concentration-dependent manner, and it significantly enhanced the apoptosis rate at all concentrations. Taurine induced the significant upregulation of PUMA and Bax, but led to downregulation of Bcl-2. In comparison to the control group, taurine treatment markedly reduced the volume and weight of A549-derived xenograft tumors in nude mice. Expression of PUMA and Bax were upregulated in the xenograft tumors following taurine treatment, whereas Bcl-2 was downregulated. In addition, the inhibitory effect of taurine and exogenous PUMA on tumor growth was significantly higher than that of a single treatment of taurine or exogenous PUMA. It can therefore be concluded that taurine can inhibit cell proliferation of the human lung cancer A549 cell line and the growth of the xenograft tumors, whereas PUMA serves an important role in taurine-induced growth suppression.
