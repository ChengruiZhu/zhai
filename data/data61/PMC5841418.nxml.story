Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the one of the most common types of endocrine cancer and has a heterogeneous prognosis. Tumors from patients with poor prognosis may differentially express specific genes. Therefore, an analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was performed and revealed that cytokine receptor-like factor 1 (CRLF1) may be a potential novel target for PTC treatment. The objective of the current study was to explore the expression of CRLF1 in PTC and to investigate the main functions and mechanisms of CRLF1 in PTC. PTC tissues exhibited higher CRLF1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels than it did with normal thyroid tissues. High CRLF1 levels were associated with aggressive clinicopathological features and poor disease-free survival rates. By using loss-of-function and gain-of-function assays, we found that CRLF1 not only increased cell migration and invasion in vitro but also promoted tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, CRLF1 induced epithelialâ€“mesenchymal transitions. Overexpression of CRLF1 activated the ERK1/2 and AKT pathways. The oncogenic effects induced by CRLF1 were suppressed by treating the cells with the MEK inhibitor U0126 or the AKT inhibitor MK-2206. These results suggest that CRLF1 enhances cell proliferation and metastasis in PTC and thus may therefore be a potential therapeutic target for PTC.
