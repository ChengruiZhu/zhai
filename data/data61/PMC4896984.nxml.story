Autoantibodies termed C3-nephritic factor (C3NeF), which stabilize convertases of the alternative complement pathway, often stimulate autoinflammatory diseases. However, knowledge about analogous autoantibodies acting on the classical pathway (C4NeF) is limited to a few reports, which indicate association with kidney dysfunction, systemic lupus erythematous, and infections. C4NeF may appear independently from C3NeF, but the lack of a routine diagnostic method predisposes C4NeF for being an underestimated player in autoinflammatory episodes. We tested the activity of classical convertases directly in serum/plasma to screen samples from 13 patients with C3 glomerulopathies and identified one patient showing significantly prolonged half-life of these enzymes. Observed effect was reproduced by immunoglobulins purified from patientâ€™s plasma and additionally confirmed on classical convertase built from purified components. Isolated immunoglobulins protected classical convertases from both spontaneous and inhibitor-driven decay but not from C4b proteolysis. The patient had a decreased serum level of C3, elevated sC5b-9, and normal concentrations of factor B and C4. Neither C3NeF nor other autoantibodies directed against alternative pathway proteins (factor H, factor B, factor I, C3, and properdin) were found. Genetic analysis showed no mutations in
