In adult congenital muscular torticollis (CMT) patients, physical therapy is not as effective because the development of sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) muscle is complete. While surgical release can address CMT in adult patients, the risk of general anesthesia and visible postoperative scar is a concern, expecially in patients with mild symptoms. In this paper, we report our experience in treating such patients with minimal-incision myotomy under local anesthesia. A review was performed for all adult patients who had undergone the simple myotomy procedure. Surgical indication was reserved for patients with mild fibrotic band in the SCM muscle with minimal lengthdiscrepancybetween the muscles. All patients had recognizable head tiltand palpation of fibrotic band on affected side of the neck. Surgical details are described in the main body of text. Three female patients had undergone the procedure. Torticollis was resolve in all patients with complete restoration of ranage of motion. There were no postoperative complications, and patient satisfaction was high. We have reported three cases of mild CMT in adult female patients, who had undergone minimal-incision myotomy under local anesthesia. Outcomes were satisafactory with no morbidity to report. With careful patient selection, this method offers an alternate treatment option for adult CMT patients with mild symptoms.
