. We used a mouse model for traumatic gastrocnemius muscle injury. Ovalbumin (OVA), which served as a foreign model antigen, was injected into the hind footpads for determination of the differentiation of OVA-specific Th-cells in the draining popliteal lymph node (pLN). The release of interferon (IFN)-γ from OVA-specific Th-cells was impaired within 24 h after injury and this impairment persisted for at least 7 days. In contrast, the proliferation of OVA-specific Th-cells remained unaffected. Injury did not modulate the function of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the pLN. Adoptive transfer of total T-cells from pLNs of injured mice inhibited IFN-γ production by OVA-specific Th-cells in naive mice. Suppressed Th1 priming did not occur in lymphocyte-deficient mice after injury but was restored by administration of T-cells before injury. Moreover, the suppression of Th1 differentiation required the presence of natural killer (NK) cells that were recruited to the pLN after injury; this recruitment was dependent on lymphocytes, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88). In summary, upon traumatic skeletal muscle injury T-cells and NK cells together prevent the development of protective Th1 immunity. Breaking this co-operation might be a novel approach to reduce the risk of infectious complications after injury.
