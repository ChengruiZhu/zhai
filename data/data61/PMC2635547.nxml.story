The cochaperone CDC37 promotes association of HSP90 with the protein kinase subset of client proteins to maintain their stability and signalling functions. HSP90 inhibitors induce depletion of clients, which include several oncogenic kinases. We hypothesised that the targeting of CDC37 using siRNAs would compromise the maturation of these clients and increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to HSP90 inhibitors. Here we show that silencing of CDC37 in human colon cancer cells diminished association of kinase clients with HSP90 and reduced levels of the clients ERBB2, CRAF, CDK4 and CDK6, as well as phosphorylated AKT. CDC37 silencing promoted the proteasome-mediated degradation of kinase clients, suggesting a degradation pathway independent from HSP90 binding. Decreased cell signalling through kinase clients was also demonstrated by reduced phosphorylation of downstream substrates and colon cancer cell proliferation was subsequently reduced by inhibition of the G1/S-phase transition. Furthermore, combining CDC37 silencing with the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG induced more extensive and sustained depletion of kinase clients and potentiated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. These results support an essential role for CDC37 in concert with HSP90 in maintaining oncogenic protein kinase clients and endorse the therapeutic potential of targeting CDC37 in cancer.
