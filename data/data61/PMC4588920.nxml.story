3D CT modeling was performed on five hip joints of patients who underwent hip arthroscopy with acetabular trimming for a presumed pincer lesion. These models were exported into point-cloud models. An acetabular 3D model was automatically created within 10 mm from the femoral head surface (Fig. 1A, B). The acetabular articular surface and rim were separated with a threshold of 5 mm, which provided an acetabular rim model with a band width of 5 mm (Fig. 1C). A local coordinate system was defined with the acetabular notch midpoint being 6 o’clock. A best-fit plane of the acetabular rim was determined by the least square method using two different acetabular rim models: 1) a model excluding the acetabular notch (plane A) and 2) a model excluding the acetabular notch and superior region from 10:30 to 3:00 (3:00 being anterior) (plane B). The acetabular rim model was transformed into a cylindrical coordinate system with an axis determined by a normal vector of the plane. The final acetabular rim model consisting of 120 points with 3° increments was created by searching the outermost points of the rim. The acetabular center was determined using best-fit sphere of the articular surface model. A reference plane including the center point was determined with orientations determined by normal vectors of the acetabular rim planes (Fig. 1C, yellow line). The 3D geometry of the rim was described by subtended angles from the normal vector of the reference plane.
