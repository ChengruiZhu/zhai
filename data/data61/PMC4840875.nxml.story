Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is the most common malignant tumor in the head and neck, and can seriously affect the daily life of patients. To study the mechanisms of LSCC, the microarray of GSE51958 was analyzed in the present study. GSE51958 was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus, and included a collection of LSCC tissue samples and matched adjacent non-cancerous tissue samples from 10 patients. Differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using limma package. Next, a weighted co-expression network was constructed for the DEGs by WGCNA package in R. Modules of the weighted co-expression network were obtained through constructing a hierarchical clustering tree using the hybrid dynamic shear tree method. Using the clusterProfiler package, the potential functions of DEGs in the modules correlated with LSCC were predicted by pathway enrichment analysis. In total, 959 DEGs were screened from the LSCC samples compared with the adjacent non-cancerous samples, including 553 upregulated and 406 downregulated genes. The appointed black, brown, gray, pink and yellow modules were screened for the DEGs in the weighted co-expression network. For the DEGs in the brown and yellow modules, the enriched pathways were cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and metabolic pathways, respectively. The DEGs in the pink module were involved in the majority of pathways. With high connectivity degrees in the pink module, TPX2, microtubule-associated (
