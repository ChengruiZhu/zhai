Proteins are composed of 20 different amino acids, 19 of which have L-chirality and one, glycine, that is achiral. A polypeptide consisting of both D- and L-amino acids cannot assume its proper three-dimensional conformation and is therefore non-functional. Since the cellular milieu contains both D- and L-amino acids, the protein synthesis machinery employs molecules to prevent D-amino acid incorporation into proteins. One key molecule in this process is an enzyme named D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase (DTD), which hydrolyses D-amino acids attached to tRNA molecules (a D-aminoacyl-tRNA). Here, we show that besides acting on D-aminoacyl-tRNA, DTD also efficiently hydrolyses the achiral glycine attached to tRNA—glycyl-tRNA(Gly)—as DTD’s active site pocket cannot discriminate between D-amino acids and glycine. Thus, DTD is designed to reject substrates with L-chirality, rather than target substrates with D-chirality. DTD’s activity on glycyl-tRNA(Gly) is potentially harmful for the cell because glycine is an essential constituent of proteins. We further demonstrate that elongation factor thermo unstable (EF-Tu), required for delivering aminoacyl-tRNAs to the ribosome for protein synthesis, protects glycyl-tRNA(Gly) against DTD, thereby preventing DTD-induced cellular toxicity. We suggest that DTD levels in the cell must be tightly regulated to maintain cellular homeostasis.
