The oncogenic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is commonly overexpressed in solid cancers. The tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR has been a major therapeutic target for cancer; however, the efficacy of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors to treat cancers has been challenged by innate and acquired resistance at the clinic. Accumulating evidence suggests that EGFR possesses kinase-independent pro-survival functions, and that cancer cells are more vulnerable to reduction of EGFR protein than to inhibition of its kinase activity. The molecular mechanism underlying loss-of-EGFR-induced cell death remains largely unknown. In this study, we show that, unlike inhibiting EGFR kinase activity that is known to induce pro-survival non-selective autophagy, downregulating EGFR protein, either by siRNA, or by a synthetic EGFR-downregulating peptide (Herdegradin), kills prostate and ovarian cancer cells via selective mitophagy by activating the mTORC2/Akt axis. Furthermore, Herdegradin induced mitophagy and inhibited the growth of orthotopic ovarian cancers in mice. This study identifies anti-mitophagy as a kinase-independent function of EGFR, reveals a novel function of mTORC2/Akt axis in promoting mitophagy in cancer cells, and offers a novel approach for pharmacological downregulation of EGFR protein as a potential treatment for EGFR-positive cancers.
