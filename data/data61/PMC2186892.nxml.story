The cell-cell interactions between fibroblasts and mononuclear leukocytes (MNL) which promote alterations in collagen accumulation were examined using a system of co-culture of human fibroblasts and peripheral blood MNL. The stimulation of collagen production was optimal after 48 h of co-culture and the increase in collagen correlated directly with the number of MNL added. The enhancement of collagen production was seen in both autologous and allogeneic co- cultures. Stimulation of non-collagenous protein was also noted. Co- culture supernatants contained soluble substances that were capable of stimulating collagen production, although they stimulated collagen production to a lesser degree than direct co-culture. Fractionation of these supernatants on Sephadex G-200 revealed a predominant area of stimulatory activity at 160,000 mol wt. Lesser areas of activity were noted at molecular weights of 80,000 and 25,000. Determination of the types of collagen produced by fibroblasts during co-culture with MNL showed that the ratio of type I:III collagen was decreased. These alterations in both the quantitative and qualitative accumulation of collagen mimic the changes often seen in wound healing and early inflammation suggesting that cellular interactions between fibroblasts and MNL may be important in the modulation of collagen production in normal and pathologic states.
