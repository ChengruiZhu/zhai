Cisplatin is a platinum-based drug that is used for the treatment of human gynecological cancers. However, molecular mechanisms of chemo-resistance in ovarian cancer are poorly understood. The aim of the study is to examine the role of coiled coil domain containing protein 69 (CCDC69) in the underlying mechanism of chemoresistance. Heavy CpG methylation (73.1% and 74.3%) was found in A2780 and A2780cis cells assessing by bisulfite sequencing. Restoration in the expression of CCDC69 was found in A2780 and A2780cis cells after 5-Aza-dC treatment. In fact, the expression levels of CCDC69 were about 3-4 fold higher in cisplatin-resistant A2780cis cells than its parental cisplatin-sensitive A2780 cells. When knockout CCDC69 in cisplatin-resistant A2780cis and SKOV3 cells by CRISPR/Cas9, the CCDC69 knockout cisplatin-resistant A2780cis and CCDC69 knockout SKOV3 cells were also shown increased sensitive to cisplatin treatment. Moreover, treating CCDC69 knockout A2780cis cells with cisplatin, abrogated G1 and G2/M arrest, increased of cleaved caspase 3&8, greater ΔΨm loss and higher levels of Bax were observed. When restoring CCDC69 expression in CCDC69 knockout A2780cis cells by transient transfection, it attenuated sensitivity to cisplatin. By immunoblotting, we found that depletion of CCDC69 increased p53 acetylation at K382 site and Bax mitochondrial redistribution. Additionally, inhibition of c-Myc enhanced cisplatin sensitivities in CCDC69 knockout A2780cis cells, overexpression of c-Myc reduced apoptosis in CCDC69 knockout SKOV3 cells. Our results showed that CCDC69 inhibition might interfere with the effectiveness of combination therapy with platinum drugs.
