Whether they are antagonistic—as between predator and prey—or beneficial—as between pollinator and flower, interactions among all the key species in an ecosystem follow regular patterns. Connectivity (the proportion of possible interactions that are actually realised), for instance, decreases with network size. The “forbidden links” hypothesis proposes that connectivity decreases because interactions are prevented by a mismatch of biological attributes between certain species. Mismatches could arise from the evolution of complementary traits in mutualistic relationships (such as insects preferring to pollinate only flowers of a certain colour) or of traits that prevent exploitation in antagonistic ones (such as a plant growing a long corolla so that insects without a long proboscis cannot reach the nectar reward). We explored the consequences of simple linkage rules based on these two variants on the topology of plant–pollination networks. When compared to data for 37 real plant–pollinator networks, we show that a “mixed” model that combines simple rules from both “complementarity” and “barrier” models best explains the pattern of interactions. This implies, for example, that deterring floral parasites is at least as important as increasing pollination efficiency in the evolution of plant–pollinator networks. Our work emphasises the value of explaining the underlying ecological and evolutionary mechanisms generating such patterns.
