The adipose tissue is a source of inflammatory proteins, such as TNF, IL-6, and CXCL8. Most of their production occurs in macrophages that act as scavengers of dying adipocytes. The application of an orbital mechanical force for 6–10 min at 97 g to the adipose tissue, lipoaspirated and treated according to Coleman procedures, abolishes the expression of TNF-α and stimulates the expression of the anti-inflammatory protein TNF-stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6). This protein had protective and anti-inflammatory effects when applied to animal models of rheumatic diseases. We examined biopsy, lipoaspirate, and mechanically activated fat and observed that in addition to the increased TSG-6, Sox2, Nanog, and Oct4 were also strongly augmented by mechanical activation, suggesting an effect on stromal cell stemness. Human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADSCs), produced from activated fat, grow and differentiate normally with proper cell surface markers and chromosomal integrity, but their anti-inflammatory action is far superior compared to those mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) obtained from lipoaspirate. The expression and release of inflammatory cytokines from THP-1 cells was totally abolished in mechanically activated adipose tissue-derived hADSCs. In conclusion, we report that the orbital shaking of adipose tissue enhances its anti-inflammatory properties, and derived MSCs maintain such enhanced activity.
