The accumulation of senescent cells is implicated in the pathology of several age-related diseases. While the clearance of senescent cells has been suggested as a therapeutic target for patients with osteoarthritis (OA), cellular senescence of bone-resident osteoblasts (OB) remains poorly explored. Since oxidative stress is a well-known inducer of cellular senescence, we here investigated the effect of antioxidant supplementation on the isolation efficiency, expansion, differentiation potential, and transcriptomic profile of OB from osteoarthritic subchondral bone. Bone chips were harvested from sclerotic and non-sclerotic regions of the subchondral bone of human OA joints. The application of 0.1 mM ascorbic acid-2-phosphate (AA) significantly increased the number of outgrowing cells and their proliferation capacity. This enhanced proliferative capacity showed a negative correlation with the amount of senescent cells and was accompanied by decreased expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cultured OB. Expanded cells continued to express differentiated OB markers independently of AA supplementation and demonstrated no changes in their capacity to osteogenically differentiate. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that apoptotic, cell cycleâ€“proliferation, and catabolic pathways were the main pathways affected in the presence of AA during OB expansion. Supplementation with AA can thus help to expand subchondral bone OB in vitro while maintaining their special cellular characteristics. The clearance of such senescent OB could be envisioned as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of OA.
