MicroRNAs are non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally and play roles in diverse pathways including those acting on development and responses to stress. Here, we describe a genome-wide computational prediction of maize miRNA genes and their characterization with respect to expression, putative targets, evolution following whole genome duplication, and allelic diversity. The structures of unprocessed primary miRNA transcripts were determined by 5′ RACE and 3′ RACE. Expression profiles were surveyed in five tissue types by deep-sequencing of small RNA libraries. We predicted miRNA targets computationally based on the most recent maize protein annotations. Analysis of the predicted functions of target genes, on the basis of gene ontology, supported their roles in regulatory processes. We identified putative orthologs in Sorghum based on an analysis of synteny and found that maize-homoeologous miRNA genes were retained more frequently than expected. We also explored miRNA nucleotide diversity among many maize inbred lines and partially inbred teosinte lines. The results indicated that mature miRNA genes were highly conserved during their evolution. This preliminary characterization based on our findings provides a framework for future analysis of miRNA genes and their roles in key traits of maize as feed, fodder, and biofuel.
