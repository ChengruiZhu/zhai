Aggregation and toxicity of the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) are considered as critical events in the initiation and progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recent evidence indicated that soluble oligomeric Aβ assemblies exert pronounced toxicity, rather than larger fibrillar aggregates that deposit in the forms of extracellular plaques. While some rare mutations in the Aβ sequence that cause early-onset AD promote the oligomerization, molecular mechanisms that induce the formation or stabilization of oligomers of the wild-type Aβ remain unclear. Here, we identified an Aβ variant phosphorylated at Ser26 residue (pSer26Aβ) in transgenic mouse models of AD and in human brain that shows contrasting spatio-temporal distribution as compared to non-phosphorylated Aβ (npAβ) or other modified Aβ species. pSer26Aβ is particularly abundant in intraneuronal deposits at very early stages of AD, but much less in extracellular plaques. pSer26Aβ assembles into a specific oligomeric form that does not proceed further into larger fibrillar aggregates, and accumulates in characteristic intracellular compartments of granulovacuolar degeneration together with TDP-43 and phosphorylated tau. Importantly, pSer26Aβ oligomers exert increased toxicity in human neurons as compared to other known Aβ species. Thus, pSer26Aβ could represent a critical species in the neurodegeneration during AD pathogenesis.
