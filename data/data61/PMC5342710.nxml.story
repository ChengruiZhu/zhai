Increasing evidence suggests that ion channels not only regulate electric signaling in excitable cells but also play important roles in the development of brain tumor. However, the roles of ion channels in glioma remain controversial. In the present study, we systematically analyzed the expression patterns of ion channel genes in a cohort of Chinese patients with glioma using RNAseq expression profiling. First, a molecular signature comprising three ion channel genes (KCNN4, KCNB1 and KCNJ10) was identified using Univariate Cox regression and two-tailed student's t test conducted in overall survival (OS) and gene expression. We assigned a risk score based on three ion channel genes to each primary Glioblastoma multiforme (pGBM) patient. We demonstrated that pGBM patients who had a high risk of unfavorable outcome were sensitive to chemotherapy. Next, we screened the three ion genes-based signature in different molecular glioma subtypes. The signature showed a Mesenchymal subtype and wild-type IDH1 preference. Gene ontology (GO) analysis for the functional annotation of the signature showed that patients with high-risk scores tended to exhibit the increased expression of proteins associated with apoptosis, immune response, cell adhesion and motion and vasculature development. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) results showed that pathways associated with negative regulation of programmed cell death, cell proliferation and locomotory behavior were highly expressed in the high-risk group. These results suggest that ion channel gene expression could improve the subtype classification in gliomas at the molecular level. The findings in the present study have been validated in two independent cohorts.
