Myofibroblastoma is a benign tumor composed of spindle cells in clusters and fascicles. To date, only three cases of intracranial myofibroblastoma have been reported. The present study reports the case of a 47-year-old female with meningeal myofibroblastoma. The patient had a history of ovarian cyst resection and presented with paroxysmal mild headaches that had been apparent for 4 years. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed a well-circumscribed mass in the left frontal lobe. A resection of the mass was performed. Abundant fascicular clusters of spindle- and oval-shaped cells were found by conventional histopathology. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that these cells were strongly positive for smooth muscle actin, weakly positive for epithelial membrane antigen and negative for cluster of differentiation (CD)117, CD34, S-100 or desmin, with a Ki-67 index of >10%. These results supported the diagnosis of myofibroblastoma. No recurrence of the mass was found during the 24-month follow-up period. Overall, the patient exhibited a rare type of meningeal neoplasm. Resection of the tumor proved to be successful and no recurrence were found. Histopathological and immunohistochemical staining is crucial to form a diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to show the presence of myofibroblastoma in the left frontal lobe.
