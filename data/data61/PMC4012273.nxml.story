Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) is a rare, distinct subtype of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, possessing an aggressive course and poor prognosis with no standard therapy. Twelve patients who have failed at least two initial CHOP or CHOP-like regimens were enrolled in this study and treated with individualized cyclosporine (CsA), prednisone (PDN), and monthly, high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (HDIVIG). The dose of CsA was adjusted individually based on the blood trough concentration of CsA and renal function. All patients were examined for response, toxicity and survival. The most significant toxicities (â‰¥ grade 2) were infection (16.7%), renal insufficiency (8.3%), hypertension (8.3%), diabetes (8.3%) and insomnia (16.7%). Discontinuation of treatment occurred in one patient (8.3%) due to grade 3 renal toxicity and subsequent grade 4 pulmonary infection. Treatment-related death was not observed. The overall response rate was 75.0% (complete response, 33.3%; partial response, 41.7%). With a median follow-up of 25.5 months, the median duration of response was 20 months (range, 12 to 49 months) and the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 25.5 months (range, 10 to 56 months). The 2-year PFS rate was 81.5%. Our findings indicate the combination of CsA, PDN and HDIVIG is an effective salvage regimen for refractory or relapsed AITL with predictable and manageable toxicity.
