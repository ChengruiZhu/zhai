Results: Twenty-two patients (19 male/3 female, average age 17.8 years) underwent surgery between 2013-2014. All patients were high school level athletes at the time of injury and included nineteen baseball players (13 pitchers), two football players, a javelin thrower and a cheerleader. Injury patterns included seven proximal tears, one mid substance, thirteen distal and four avulsions. Nine patients underwent ulnar transposition at the time of surgery, one had undergone prior transposition and the remainder of the patient’s ulnar nerves were left in situ. At six and twelve months the average KJOC scores respectively were 88.3 and 93. Patients that underwent transposition had KJOC scores of 78.3 at six months and 97.5 at twelve while patients that were left in-situ scored 82 and 91. These differences were not significant. The average number of weeks until initiation of plyometrics was seven and an interval throwing program was initiated on average, by week eleven. The average time to throwing from the mound was twenty weeks and full return to sports was twenty-one. Twelve of the thirteen pitchers made it back to the same or next level and six of them did so by transitioning from another position back to pitcher. The remaining athletes in the cohort all returned to competition at their pre injury level. At six months all but one patient was “very” satisfied and at twelve months, all were satisfied. At six months, patients deemed themselves to be at 92% normal and at twelve months, 96%.
