The FOXO6 correlated with tumor progression in a wide range of carcinomas, yet little is known in gastric cancer. The expression of FOXO6 and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) was assessed by immunohistochemistry in 192 gastric carcinoma specimens. The correlation between FOXO6 expression with MMP-9, clinicopathological/prognostic value in gastric cancer was examined. FOXO6 overexpression was significantly associated with depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis and stage of disease. In univariate and multivariate analyses, FOXO6 was an independent prognostic factor for both overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Moreover, FOXO6 over-expression was correlated with poor prognosis in patients subgroups stratified by tumor size, depth of invasion and lymph node metastasis. FOXO6 expression was increased in both prominent serosal invasion group and lymph node metastasis group. In addition, FOXO6 expression was positively correlated with MMP-9 among 192 gastric cancer tissues. Patients with FOXO6 over-expression had poor OS and shorter RFS in low and high invasiveness groups. Furthermore, stratified analysis showed that the TNM stage I patients with high FOXO6 expression had poor prognosis than those with low FOXO6 expression. In conclusion, FOXO6 overexpression promotes tumor aggressiveness and prognosis, and could be a promising target for prognostic prediction in gastric cancer patients.
