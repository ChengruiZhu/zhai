Suppose you are asked to shoot free throws with a basketball. If you’re an unskilled shooter, you may at first miss in a consistent way for consecutive shots—perhaps a bit to the right—but you will soon learn to correct that error. However, an often-repeated finding is that if error information is withheld, such as if you close your eyes just after releasing the ball, performance will regress toward baseline. One explanation is that newly-formed motor memories are intrinsically volatile, decaying away if there is no continued performance feedback. However, recent work proposed an alternative mechanism: that newly-formed motor memories are intrinsically stable, but people change their behavior upon detecting a context change. This hypothesis predicts decay will occur only after the change is detected, leading to delayed decay if the context change is purposefully masked in an experiment. We show that previous estimates of decay onset delay, which provided support for the context-dependent decay hypothesis, were systematically biased and that decay instead begins immediately, without delay, even when context changes are effectively masked, in stark contrast to the 40+ trial delays previously reported. Thus, we show that recent memories decay independently of context change detection, suggesting that they are indeed intrinsically volatile.
