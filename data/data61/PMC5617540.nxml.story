The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is an inflammation marker that has prognostic value for various tumors, but its prognostic value in urothelial carcinoma (UC) remains controversial. This meta-analysis investigated the prognostic value of NLR in UC. A systematic search was performed on PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and Embase for studies focusing on the association between NLR and clinical features or prognosis of UC and published until November 2016. Prognostic outcomes and clinical features were collected and analyzed. A total of 11,538 patients from 32 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Increased pretreatment NLR predicted poor overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.45–2.05), progression free survival (HR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.44–1.96), and cancer specific survival (HR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.39–1.93) in all the patients. The increased pretreatment NLR was correlated with increased lymphovascular invasion (HR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.17–1.43), high tumor T stage (HR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.12–1.39), and tumor grade (HR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.01–1.14) but not with lymph node involvement, carcinoma in situ, multifocality, or positive margin. Our meta-analysis indicated that NLR could predict the prognosis for UC and was associated with UC progression in terms of lymphovascular invasion, tumor T stage, and tumor grade.
