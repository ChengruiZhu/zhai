Genomic imprinting refers to genes that are silent when maternally inherited but expressed when paternally inherited, or vice versa. Hailed as the most successful evolutionary explanation for genomic imprinting, the kinship theory contends that the paternally inherited copy of a gene, which determines the allocation of maternal resources to her offspring, is selected to extract more resources than its maternally inherited counterpart. The conflict between genes of different parental origin leads to the silencing of one copy but the expression of the other. As originally formulated, the kinship theory assumes that mothers contribute all resources to the raising of offspring. Yet this is not entirely true, as biparental care is common in some mammals, particularly humans. By positing that fathers contribute some resources and analyzing the effect on the kinship theory, I derived new conditions for the evolution of genomic imprinting and discovered that biparental care does not necessarily increase the opportunities for intragenomic conflict. Interestingly, biparental care allows for the evolution of patterns of expression opposite to the ones originally predicted in the kinship theory. Insight gained from my model explains the clinical phenotype of Prader-Willi syndrome, which has so far been a challenge to the kinship theory. Children suffering from this syndrome exhibit a striking biphasic phenotype characterized by poor sucking and reduced weight before weaning but voracious appetite and obesity afterwards. I argue that, in humans, the paternal contribution increases after weaning. This would explain the evolution of genes with the opposite imprinting pattern before and after weaning, and thus sheds light on the bi-phasic phenotype of Prader-Willi syndrome.
