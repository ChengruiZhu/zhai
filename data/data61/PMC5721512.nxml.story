The purpose of these case reports is to emphasize the importance of knowledge regarding the root canal morphology and current diagnostic aids one should have as both of these important factors going to affect the prognosis of the endodontic treatment. These two case reports describe the maxillary and mandibular first molars with multiple canals. After clinical and radiographic diagnosis, additional help of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) of mandibular molar has been taken to evaluate the morphology and canal pattern; while maxillary molar was evaluated using CBCT scan to evaluate the canal configuration and obturation. In CBCT evaluation, the mandibular molar was diagnosed with six separated canals with three mesial and three distal canals and with radix paramolaris and radix entomolaris. The maxillary molar had five canals with three mesiobuccal (MB) canals. Both molars were instrumented with conventional hand and rotary file systems and obturated by conventional lateral compaction method. The axial images from CBCT show Vertucci Type VIII canal pattern in both roots of first mandibular molars and in MB root of maxillary first molar Sert and Bayirli Type XVIII canal configuration and no accessory canal in distobuccal and palatal root. With the recent innovations in diagnostic and operating aids, we can come across many variations in the root canal morphology of both mandibular and maxillary teeth, especially multi-rooted one (i.e., molars), and the knowledge of which leads to successful endodontic treatment with an excellent prognosis.
