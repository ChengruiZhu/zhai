The pressure on boys and men to engage in extensive body practices (e.g., closely monitored eating and exercise habits) and achieve ideal male bodies has grown significantly over the past 20 years. Central to the depiction of ideal male bodies and body practices are both the pursuit and achievement of lean and well-defined muscles. The labels “pitches,” “purchases,” and “performativities” were inductively derived from the literature, and used to describe the multifaceted connections between masculinities, muscularity, and idealized male body practices. “Pitches” distil how popular culture posture norms of masculinity, and manly bodies and behaviors attainable and necessary. “Purchases” refer to men’s diverse buy-in to dominant discourses about acceptable male bodies and practices. “Performativities” chronicle how men embody and navigate gender norms as they evaluate their own bodies, behaviors, and eating habits and those of their peers. Based on findings from the current scoping review, future research could benefit from fully linking masculinities with the drive for muscularity to address health and social risks associated with the pursuit of the idealized male body. In highlighting the plurality of masculinities and the complexity of men’s diverse identities, health care providers can better reach and support men. Focusing on, and celebrating, a wider range of male bodies could help recenter dominant discourses about how and whose bodies and experiences are idealized. The current scoping review article offers an overview of how masculinities and muscularity have been linked to male body practices, and recommendations to advance this emergent field.
