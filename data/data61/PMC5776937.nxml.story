Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a rare and fatal tumor. In previous decades, there has been a steady increase in the incidence and mortality rates of this tumor worldwide. Metastasis is regarded as the major factor that contributes to poor prognosis in CCA patients. Studies therefore aim to develop novel therapeutic targets to control CCA metastasis. Fyn is known to enhance expression and promote metastasis in various cancers, including pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer and colorectal cancer. However, the exact function and mechanism of Fyn in CCA metastasis remains unclear. In the present study, mRNA and protein expression levels of Fyn, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphorylated (p-)AMPK, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p-mTOR were measured, using the reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, in CCA tissues and cell lines. In addition, Transwell assays were used to determine the migratory and invasive abilities of human CCA QBC939, following transfection. In the present study, it was found that Fyn was overexpressed in CCA cell lines. Fyn knockdown inhibited CCA cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that Fyn knockdown induces phosphorylation of AMPK, inhibits downstream phosphorylation of mTOR, and activate the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway. Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, inhibited the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway, and reversed the effect of Fyn knockdown on migration and invasion of CCA cells. In conclusion, the present study suggests that Fyn knockdown inhibits cell migration and invasion by regulating the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway in CCA cell lines and that Fyn knockdown is a potential target for anti-CCA therapy.
