In addition to forming a department for the university, Campbell helped establish one of the first hospitals for crippled children in the south, then the Willis Cohoon Campbell Clinic in 1920 [1], and finally in 1923 the Hospital for Crippled Adults. The Campbell clinic provided postgraduate training, meeting the requirements of the American Board for the Certification of Specialists. Dr. Campbell, while not one of the original nine board members of the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery, was influential in establishing the Board in 1934. According to Wickstrom [4], a “...persistent rumor, repeatedly denied, held that Henderson (Melvin) and Campbell were the primary movers behind the establishment of both the American Academy of Orthopaedic surgeons and the American Board in Orthopaedic Surgery; their actions were said to be a retaliatory response to their rejection by the orthopaedic establishment ‘in the East.’” Be that as it may, Dr. Campbell served as President of a number of professional organizations [1]. He published many papers and three monographs, including the classic “Operative Orthopaedics” [3], which has gone through 10 editions, was the standard textbook for orthopaedic surgeons for decades and remains one of the most widely read references. Dr. Campbell was widely known as a kind, courteous man [5].
