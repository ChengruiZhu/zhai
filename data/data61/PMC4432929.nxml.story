Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) is a transcription factor which plays divergent roles in a number of physiological or pathological process. However, the expression and role of KLF4 in renal fibrosis remain undetermined. The aim of the present study was to determine the epigenetic alterations of KLF4 and its potential role and mechanisms of action in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in renal fibrosis. The hypermethylation of the KLF4 promoter accompanied by a decrease in KLF4 expression were observed in mice subjected to unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and in HK-2 cells stimulated with transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1. However, treatment with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine attenuated the TGF-β1-induced downregulation of KLF4 and E-cadherin and the upregulation of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) in the HK-2 cells. DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) participated in the TGF-β1-mediated hypermethylation of the KLF4 promoter in the HK-2 cells. In addition, functional analysis demonstrated that the overexpression of KLF4 led to an increase in the expression of E-cadherin and zonula occludens-l (ZO-1), and a decrease in the expression of α-SMA and fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP-1), thus reversing the effects of the suppression of KLF4. These data suggest that KLF4 inhibits the progression of EMT in renal epithelial cells. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that KLF4 is downregulated during EMT in renal fibrosis
