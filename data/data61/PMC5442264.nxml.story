Ectosomes are small heterogeneous membrane vesicles generated by budding from the plasma membrane in a variety of cell types and, more frequently, in tumor cells. They are shed into the extracellular space and are proposed as a novel form of intracellular communication in which information is transmitted from the originating cell to recipient cells without direct cell-to-cell contact. This review focuses on a single population of extracellular vesiclesâ€”ectosomes. We summarize recent studies of tumor-derived ectosomes which examine their biogenesis and protein cargo, and their influence on different aspects of cancer progression. We discuss possible clinical implications involving ectosomes as potential biomarkers, diagnostic tools and treatment targets in oncology. The unique composition of the molecules (cargo) that ectosomes carry, and their functional role, depends largely on the state of their originating cell. Through horizontal transfer of a variety of biologically active molecules (including proteins, lipids and nucleic acids) between donor and recipient cells, tumor-derived ectosomes may play functional roles in oncogenic transformation, tumor progression, invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis promotion, escape from immune surveillance, and drug resistance, thereby facilitating disease progression. The presence of tumor-derived ectosomes in body fluids such as the blood and urine of cancer patients makes them potentially useful prognostic and predictive biomarkers. Tumor-derived ectosomes also offer possible targets for multiple therapeutic strategies.
