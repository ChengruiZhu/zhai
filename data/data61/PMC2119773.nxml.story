We have addressed the question of whether two highly conserved noncoding regions of the gamma-actin gene are of functional importance. Human gamma-actin gene constructs deleted for either the entire 3' untranslated region (UTR) and 3' flank or intron III sequences were transfected into mouse myoblasts and the resulting clones were analyzed for cell morphology and actin protein expression. Transfectants carrying the gamma-actin gene deleted for the 3' end (gamma 22) exhibited numerous long pseudopods and increased surface area. In contrast, transfectants expressing the gamma-actin gene deleted for intron III (gamma 156) were rounded with blebs over the cell surface and showed decreased surface area. The relative expression of beta- to gamma-actin protein decreased for both transfectant types. The total actin protein levels remained constant for the gamma 22 cells but decreased for the gamma 156 cells. The results indicate that alterations to transfectant cell morphology can be influenced by the presence or absence of different noncoding regions in the transfected gamma-actin gene. The mechanisms by which noncoding regions of the gamma-actin gene influence the impact of the gene are unknown. Nevertheless, these noncoding regions are isoform specific and highly conserved in evolution. We propose that the functional significance of the different actin isoforms may involve the properties of these noncoding regions in addition to the differences in protein sequence.
