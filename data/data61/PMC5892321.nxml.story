Case 1 was an 82-year-old man with tubal exposure in his right eye 26 months after receiving a Baerveldt glaucoma implant. The tube was covered by surrounding conjunctival tissue combined with subconjunctival placement of an ologen Collagen Matrix as a patch graft. Two years after implantation, the tube was not exposed. Anterior-segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) showed dense conjunctival tissue over the tube. Case 2 was an 82-year-old man with peripheral keratitis, anterior scleritis, and secondary glaucoma in the right eye who underwent tube shunt surgery using an Ahmed glaucoma valve and cataract surgery. Intraoperatively, scleritis-related scleral thinning prevented the tube from being covered fully by an autologous scleral flap. An ologen Collagen Matrix was placed over the scleral flap as a patch graft. Seventeen months after implantation, the tube was not exposed. Case 3 was a 52-year-old man with diabetic maculopathy and steroid-induced glaucoma in the right eye who underwent tube shunt surgery using an Ahmed glaucoma valve. Intraoperatively, a flap defect prevented the tube from being covered fully by an autologous scleral flap. An ologen Collagen Matrix was placed over the scleral flap as a patch graft. Three weeks postoperatively, AS-OCT showed thick subconjunctival tissue over the tube. Three months after implantation, the tube was not exposed.
