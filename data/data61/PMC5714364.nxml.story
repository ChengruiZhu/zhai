 wireless, telemetric radiation dosimeters for absolute dose measurements. The dosimeter uses a semiconductor device called a metal–oxide semiconductor field‐effect transistor (MOSFET) to measure radiation dose. A MOSFET is a transistor that is generally used for amplifying or switching electronic signals. The implantable dosimeter was implemented with the goal of verifying the dose delivered to radiation therapy patients. For the purpose of acceptance testing, commissioning, and clinical implementation and to evaluate characteristics of the dosimeter, the following tests were performed: 1) temperature dependence, 2) reproducibility, 3) field size dependence, 4) postirradiation signal drift, 5) dependence on average dose rate, 6) linearity test, 7) angular dependence (different gantry angle position), 8) angular dependence (different DVS angle position), 9) dose rate dependence, 10) irradiation depth dependence, 11) effect of cone‐beam exposure to the dosimeter, and 12) multiple reading effect. The dosimeter is not currently calibrated for use in the kV range; nonetheless, the effect of the cone‐beam procedure on the MOSFET dosimeter was investigated. Phantom studies were performed in both air and water using an Elekta Synergy S Beam‐Modulator linear accelerator. Commissioning and clinical implementation for prostate cancer patients receiving external‐beam radiation therapy were performed in compliance with the general recommendations given for
