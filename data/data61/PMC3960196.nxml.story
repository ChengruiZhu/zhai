The majority of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and favorable prognostic features live for long periods without treatment. However, unexpected disease progression is observed in some cases. In a cohort of untreated CD38-CLL patients with normal FISH or isolated 13q− we found that, by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), 16/28 cases presented, within immunomagnetic sorted CD38+ cells, genetic lesions undetectable in the CD38- fraction. These patients showed a shorter time to first treatment (TTFT, p=0.0162) in comparison to cases without FISH lesions in CD38+ cells. Patients with FISH abnormalities in CD38+ cells showed a distinctive microRNA profile, characterized by the down-regulation of miR-125a-5p both in the CD38- and CD38+ populations. In an independent cohort of 71 consecutive untreated CD38- CLL with normal FISH or isolated 13q−, a lower miR125a-5p expression was associated with a shorter TTFT both in univariate and multivariate analysis (p=0.003 and 0.016, respectively) and with a higher prevalence of mutations (7/12 vs 0/8, p=0.015) as assessed by next-generation sequencing. In conclusion, our data showed previously unrecognized subclonal heterogeneity within the CD38+ fraction of CD38- CLL patients with low-risk FISH findings and suggested an association between down-regulated miR-125a-5p expression, genetic complexity and worse outcome.
