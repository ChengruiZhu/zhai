) that bacterial spores exhibit the same general curve of migration velocity as vegetative cells, although the actual velocity is apparently slightly less. 3. All of the observed phenomena appear to be in accord with the assumption that marked differences in dielectric constants did not appear under the conditions studied and if this assumption be granted the results are in accord with the fundamental postulates of the Donnan equilibrium as applied to the explanation of the origin of potential difference between a bacterial cell and its enveloping menstruum. It is possible but not at all certain that the phenomenon of antagonism may require the introduction of additional assumptions for its explanation. Professor Donnan and other investigators have clearly understood the importance of applying the concept of membrane equilibria in the elucidation of physiological phenomena. Our findings add to the numerous vindications favoring this view and emphasize the importance of further study of membrane equilibria in bacterial suspensions. We have pointed out that certain potential differences between bacteria and their menstrua are apparently associated with some of the phenomena of viability. Viability and potential differences may, however, under certain conditions vary quite independently as evidenced by the fact that normal rates of migration are demonstrable after the cells have been killed by heat. Thus, considerable caution must be exercised in relating the existence of these charges to the metabolism of the cell.
