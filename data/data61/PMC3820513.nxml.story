Small drug molecules usually bind to unintended off-targets, leading to unexpected drug responses such as side effects or drug repositioning opportunities. Thus, identifying unintended drug-target interactions (DTI) is particularly required for understanding complicated drug actions. It remains expensive nowadays to experimentally determine DTI, so various computational methods are developed. In this study, we initiatively demonstrated that target binding is directly correlated with drug induced genomic expression profiles in Connectivity Map (CMap). By improving data quality of CMap, we illustrated three important facts: (1) Drugs binding to common targets show higher gene-expression similarity than random compounds, indicating that upstream ligand binding could be characterized by downstream gene-expression change. (2) It is found that some targets are better characterized by CMap than others. To guarantee efficiency of DTI discovery, prediction models should be specifically built for those well characterized targets. (3) It is broadly observed in the predicted DTI that ligands for the same target may collectively interact with common off-target. This observation is consistent with published experimental evidence and can help illustrate the mechanisms of unexplained drug reactions. Based on CMap, our work established an efficient pipeline of identifying potential DTI. By extending the success in CMap to other genomic data sources, we believe more DTI would be discovered.
