Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN1) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by primary hyperparathyroidism, enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and anterior pituitary adenomas. A 16-year-old male presented to the emergency outpatient clinic with tonic convulsions. Physical examination in the postconvulsive period was unremarkable and revealed a muscular, postpubertal adolescent. Biochemical tests at admission were consistent with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and remarkable for elevated levels of liver transaminases and creatine kinase. Work-up for a potential inborn error of metabolism and Doppler ultrasound for congenital portal-hepatic shunt were negative. When the patient was questioned, he reported using the anabolic steroid stanozolol to strengthen his muscles. His enzyme levels normalized after cessation of stanozolol. Hypoglycemia did not recur on diazoxide therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging showed two discrete lesions in the pancreas. Distal pancreatectomy revealed two masses 1.1 and 1.4 cm in diameter: a solid pseudopapillary tumor and an insulinoma. The patient also had asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism. DNA sequence analysis of the MEN1 gene in the index patient and his father and brother revealed a previously reported “pW183S” heterozygous mutation. This case further adds to the “pancreatic tumor” phenotype of MEN1 with the presence of a solid pseudopapillary tumor. This case report also confirms the need to meticulously question drug abuse in adolescents presenting to clinics with diagnostic challenges.
