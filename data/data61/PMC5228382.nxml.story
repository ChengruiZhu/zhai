Lung cancer is the most common cancer after breast and colon cancer, with high rates of mortality, worldwide. There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), which accounts for approximately 20% of all lung cancer cases and non-SCLC, which accounts for almost 80% of lung cancer cases. Although lung cancer is one of the most aggressive types of cancer, progress in achieving better clinical outcomes has been gradual. Even though a number of markers have been suggested for the diagnosis of lung cancer and monitoring of disease progression, there is no clear way of assessing the invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasizing capability of the primary tumor cells. We investigated the incidence of cytokeratin 19 (CK19)-negative expressers in different types of lung cancer from 111 lung cancer patients, their serum and pleural effusion CYFRA21-1 levels and whether induction of EMT in the primary focus cells influences the expression of CK19. In addition, we examined whether CK19-negative lung cancers were more invasive and metastatic. We also examined the propensity of primary focus cells to undergo EMT in the presence of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). The results obtained suggested that the invasion and metastasis of lung tumor cells can be assessed by having a complete picture of serum CYFRA21-1 together with the CK19 expression status of primary focus cells and pleural effusion. This assessment may be further improved by examining the propensity of the isolated primary focus cells to undergo TGF-β1 induced EMT in cell culture.
