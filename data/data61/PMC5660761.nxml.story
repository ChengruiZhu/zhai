We aimed to identify risk pathways for postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) via establishing an microRNAs- (miRNA-) regulated pathway network (MRPN). Firstly, we identified differential pathways through calculating gene- and pathway-level statistics based on the accumulated normal samples using the individual pathway aberrance score (iPAS). Significant pathways based on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using DAVID were extracted, followed by identifying the common pathways between iPAS and DAVID methods. Next, miRNAs prediction was implemented via calculating TargetScore values with precomputed input (log fold change (FC), TargetScan context score (TSCS), and probabilities of conserved targeting (PCT)). An MRPN construction was constructed using the common genes in the common pathways and the predicted miRNAs. Using false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05, 279 differential pathways were identified. Using the criteria of FDR < 0.05 and |log⁡FC| ≥ 2, 39 DEGs were retrieved, and these DEGs were enriched in 64 significant pathways identified by DAVID. Overall, 27 pathways were the common ones between two methods. Importantly, MAPK signaling pathway and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway were the first and second significantly enriched ones, respectively. These 27 common pathways separated PMOP from controls with the accuracy of 0.912. MAPK signaling pathway and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway might play crucial roles in PMOP.
