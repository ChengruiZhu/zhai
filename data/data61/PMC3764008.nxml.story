Within a cell, protein-protein interactions vary considerably in their degree of stickiness. Mutations at protein interfaces can alter the interaction between protein pairs, causing them to dissociate faster or slower. This may lead to an alteration in the dynamics of the cellular networks in which these proteins are involved. Therefore, the calculation and interpretation of mutants, which affect the rate of dissociation, is critical to our understanding of complex networks and disease. A key characteristic of proteinâ€“protein interfaces is that a subset of residues are responsible for most of the binding energy, such residues are called hotspots and effectively represent the sticky points of the interaction. In this work, we exploit both hotspot energies and organization and use them for the calculation of off-rate changes upon mutations. The insights gained provide us with a clearer understanding of the critical regions of stability and how they change for complexes of different sizes. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive map of the key determinants responsible for the accurate characterization of different classes of mutations, complexes and interface regions. This paves the way for more intelligent computational-interface-design algorithms and provides new insight into the interpretation of destabilizing mutations involved in complex diseases.
