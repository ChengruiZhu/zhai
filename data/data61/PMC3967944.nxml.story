Several drugs intended to treat cardiac arrhythmias have failed because of unfavorable rate-dependent properties. That is, the drugs fail to alter electrical activity at fast heart rates, where this would be beneficial, but they do affect electrical activity at slow rates, where this is unwanted. In targeted studies, several agents have been shown to exhibit these unfavorable properties, suggesting that these rate-dependent responses may be intrinsic to ventricular muscle. To determine whether drugs with desirable rate-dependent properties could be rationally designed, we performed comprehensive and systematic analyses of several heart cell models. These analyses calculated the rate-dependent properties of changes in any model parameter, thereby generating simultaneously a large number of model predictions. The analyses showed that targets with favorable rate-dependent properties could indeed be identified, and further simulations uncovered the mechanisms underlying these behaviors. Moreover, a quantitative comparison of results obtained in different models provided new insight in why a given drug applied to different species, or to different tissue types, might produce different rate-dependent behaviors. Overall this study shows how a comprehensive and systematic approach to heart cell models can both identify novel targets and produce more general insight into rate-dependent alterations to cardiac electrical activity.
