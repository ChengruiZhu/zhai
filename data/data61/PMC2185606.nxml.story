Responses to the synthetic terpolymer L-glutamic acid, L-lysine, L-tyrosine (GLT) in the mouse are controlled by H-2-1inked Ir-GLTgenes. (Responder Ã— nonresponder) F(1) hybrid mice, themselves phenotypic responders, can be primed with GLT to develop specific helper cells capable of interacting with 2,4-dinitrophenyl hapten (DNP)-primed F(1) B cells in response to DNP-GLT. Unlike the indiscriminant ability of F(1) helper T cells for conventional antigens (i.e. not Ir gene-controlled), which can help B cells of either parental type (as well as F(1)) equally well, GLT-primed F(1) T cells can only provide help under normal circumstances for B lymphocytes of responder parent origin; they are unable to communicate effectively with nonresponder parental B cells (1, and the present studies). The present studies reveal, however, that the induction of a parental cell-induced allogeneic effect during priming of F(1) mice to GLT actually dictates the direction of cooperating preference that will be displayed by such F(1) helper cells for B cells of one parental type or the other. Thus, F(1) T cells, primed to GLT under the influence of an allogeneic effect induced by parental BALB/c cells, develop into effective helpers for nonresponder A/J B cells, but fail to develop effective helpers for responder BALB/c B cells, and vice-versa. In contrast, F(1) T cells, primed to GLT under the influence of an allogeneic effect induced by either parental type, display significantly enhanced levels of helper activity for B cells derived from F(1) donors. These results are interpreted to reflect the existence of two interdependent events provoked by the allogeneic effect: one event augments the differentiation of GLT-specific helper T cells belonging to the subset corresponding to the opposite parental type; this would explain the development of increased helper activity provided to partner B cells of opposite parental type (as well as of F(1) origin). The second event, we postulate, involves the production of responses against the receptors which normally self-recognize native cell interaction determinants; this form of anti-idiotype response is restricted against self- recognizing receptors of the same parental type used for induction of the allogeneic effect, hence explaining diminished helper activity of such F(1) cells for partner B lymphocytes of corresponding parental type.
