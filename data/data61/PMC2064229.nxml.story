The first events of the development of any embryo are under maternal control until the zygotic genome becomes activated. In the mouse embryo, the major wave of transcription activation occurs at the 2-cell stage, but transcription starts already at the zygote (1-cell) stage. Very little is known about the molecules involved in this process. We show that the transcription intermediary factor 1 α (TIF1α) is involved in modulating gene expression during the first wave of transcription activation. At the onset of genome activation, TIF1α translocates from the cytoplasm into the pronuclei to sites of active transcription. These sites are enriched with the chromatin remodelers BRG-1 and SNF2H. When we ablate TIF1α through either RNA interference (RNAi) or microinjection of specific antibodies into zygotes, most of the embryos arrest their development at the 2–4-cell stage transition. The ablation of TIF1α leads to mislocalization of RNA polymerase II and the chromatin remodelers SNF2H and BRG-1. Using a chromatin immunoprecipitation cloning approach, we identify genes that are regulated by TIF1α in the zygote and find that transcription of these genes is misregulated upon TIF1α ablation. We further show that the expression of some of these genes is dependent on SNF2H and that RNAi for SNF2H compromises development, suggesting that TIF1α mediates activation of gene expression in the zygote via SNF2H. These studies indicate that TIF1α is a factor that modulates the expression of a set of genes during the first wave of genome activation in the mouse embryo.
