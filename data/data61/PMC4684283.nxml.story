During replication, errors that escape the replication machinery are identified and repaired by DNA mismatch repair proteins. A mismatch in the helix is recognized by MutS homologs and subsequent events include excision of the error-containing strand followed by re-synthesis. A critical step in this process is directing repair to the newly synthesized strand. Current data suggest that transient discontinuities in the DNA backbone, known as nicks, generated during replication serve as the strand discrimination signals. Additionally, proteins that package DNA have the capacity to block mismatch recognition and are known to rapidly assemble behind the replication fork. Thus, there must be a short window of opportunity for the mismatch recognition complexes to scan for mismatches and access the strand discrimination signals. To address these issues, we tested the model that the mismatch recognition complexes track with the replisome. We employed high resolution genomic methods to determine that during replication, the mismatch recognition complexes bind origins of replication and advances with the replisome. The findings support the hypothesis that the mismatch recognition proteins track with the DNA replication machinery to accurately survey and repair the newly synthesized strands while the DNA is unpackaged and strand specificity signals are accessible.
