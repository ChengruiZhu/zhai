The management of recurrent diffuse low-grade gliomas (LGGs) is controversial. In the present study, the multidisciplinary management of 35 patients with recurrent LGGs was retrospectively analyzed. Tumor progression or recurrence was defined by clinical, radiological and/or metabolic pejorative evolution. All patients were regularly followed up by a multidisciplinary neuro-oncological group at Hôpital Erasme. Patients with histologically confirmed supratentorial LGGs (7 astrocytoma, 22 oligodendrogliomas and 6 oligoastrocytomas) who had undergone surgery between August 2004 and November 2010 were included. A total of 3 patients exhibited no tumor progression (median follow-up (FU), 81 months; range, 68–108 months). Tumor recurrence occurred in the 32 remaining patients [progression-free survival (PFS), 26 months; range, 2–104 months]. In addition, 25/29 (86%) patients who received surgery alone underwent reoperation at the time of tumor recurrence, and high-grade transformation occurred in 6 of these patients (24%). Furthermore, 4/29 (14%) patients were treated with adjuvant therapy alone (3 chemotherapy and 1 radiotherapy). In the 19 patients with no high-grade transformation at reintervention, 3 received adjuvant therapy and 16 were regularly followed up through multimodal imaging. The PFS time of the patients who underwent reoperation with close FU (n=16) and for the patients receiving adjuvant therapy with or without surgery (n=7) at first recurrence was 10 and 24 months (P=0.005), respectively. However, no significant difference was observed for overall survival (P=0.403). At the time of this study, 22 of the 35 patients included were alive following a median FU time of 109 months (range, 55–136). The results of the present study could change the multidisciplinary approach used into a more aggressive approach with adjuvant therapy, with or without surgery, for the treatment of a select subpopulation of patients with LGGs at the first instance of tumor recurrence.
