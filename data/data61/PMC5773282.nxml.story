Neuromonitoring has beenÂ utilized during spinal surgery to assess the function of the spinal cord in an effort to prevent intraoperative injury. Although its use is widespread, no clear benefit has been demonstrated. Our goal in this study was to interrogate the value of intraoperative neuromonitoring in decreasing the severity and rate of neurological injury during and after spinal surgery. Here we describe our experience of 121 patients who underwent spinal cord procedures with the combination of intraoperative neuromonitoring, to determine its ability to detect neurological changes and the specificity and sensitivity in this setting. The data for the 121 patients who underwent neurophysiological monitoring during various spinal procedures was collected retrospectively. The patients were classified into one of four groups according to the findings of intraoperative monitoring and the clinical outcomes on postoperative neurological exam. Intraoperative monitoring was evaluated for its specificity, sensitivity, and predictive value. In our cohort of 121 patients, the use of intraoperative neuromonitoring had a low sensitivity, which may produce an excessive number of false negatives. Based on these findings, neuromonitoring seems to have a poor positive predictive value and is thus an inappropriate test to prevent harm to patients.
