Replicative Helicase DnaB interacts with DnaA, DnaC, DnaG, and DNA polymerase III to commence replication, increase the movement rate of the replication fork, and to assemble part of the primosome. The formation of the replication fork is limited by the ability to load DnaB to the DNA, thus DnaB has shown to be vital to a large extent. In the absence of DnaB, the replication fork is not maintained and in a state of inactivity the replication fork degrades and collapses. To further understand importance of this enzyme from an evolutionary perspective, a genomic analysis DnaB protein sequences, chosen from five Proteobacteria subclasses was performed. Our analysis indicates that, DnaB replicative helicases of Alphaproteobacteria and Epsilonproteobacteria have diverged at an earlier stage from Betaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria as well as from one another. Our results were further supported, when we reanalyzed and reconstructed the phylogenetic tree after the inclusion of sequences from Actinobacteria and Firmicute phylum. In addition, Betaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria appear to share a closer common ancestor than from the other two subclasses. The Dot-plot analysis indicated that, the region between amino acid residues 320 to 400 was strongly conserved among all five subclasses.
