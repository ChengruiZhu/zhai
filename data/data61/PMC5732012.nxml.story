Edema bullae typically forms at the site of skin swelling during acute states of volume overload, most commonly during renal or cardiac failure. Herpes zoster is a reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus that typically presents as painful vesicles in a dermatomal distribution. In immunocompromised individuals, disseminated herpes zoster skin manifestations may occur with several lesions in multiple dermatomes or widespread individual lesions or both, even visceral organs can be involved. Additionally, many conditions are known to mimic the lesions and distribution of herpes zoster. A 53-year-old immunosuppressed male with a history of renal transplant presented with dermatomal and non-dermatomal, disseminated herpes zoster that was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing. After one week of intravenous antiviral therapy during which his virus infection-associated lesions were resolved, new blisters developed near the insertion site of a peripheral venous line located on a previously uninvolved yet swollen upper extremity. The varicella zoster virus disease was initially suspected, but lab studies and skin biopsy of a blister excluded progressive or persistent viral infection and established a diagnosis of acute edema bullae. The blisters resolved following removal of the peripheral catheter. Acute edema bullae should be added to the list of mimickers of disseminated varicella zoster virus infection.
