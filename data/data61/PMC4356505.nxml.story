(âˆ’)-Epigallocatechingallate (EGCG) as a representative polyphenol has attracted increasing attention due to its diversified effects, especially its potential as an agent for the prevention or treatment of certain cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms of EGCG-induced apoptosis in B lymphoma cells are unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of EGCG on proliferation and apoptosis in the B lymphoma cell lines Jeko-1 and Raji, and determine the underlying mechanisms. Cell proliferation and cytotoxicity were determined by the cell counting kit (CCK-8) assay; apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry using the Annexin V-PE/7AAD double staining; Fas, Bcl-2 and Bax mRNA expression levels were determined by real-time PCR; caspase activity was measured by the caspase activity assay kit; the expression levels of apoptosis-associated proteins were determined by western blot analysis. We demonstrated that EGCG induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In agreement, EGCG upregulated the mRNA expression of Fas and Bax while downregulating Bcl-2. Protein expression levels of Bax, activated caspase-3, -7, -8, and -9, and PARP were increased, while Bcl-2 protein levels were reduced by EGCG treatment. Taken together, EGCG induces B lymphoma cell apoptosis by triggering caspase-dependent intrinsic (mitochondrial) and extrinsic (death receptor) pathways. These findings suggest that EGCG may be a potential agent for the treatment of B lymphoma.
