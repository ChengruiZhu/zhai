Correlated activity is observed ubiquitously in the CNS but how activation of specific neural circuits affects correlated activity under behaviorally relevant contexts is poorly understood. Here, through a combination of electrophysiology, pharmacology, and mathematical modeling, we show that activation of the same parallel fiber feedback pathway leads to simultaneous reductions in both signal and noise correlations via independent mechanisms. Specifically, we show that feedback in the form of a negative image of the stimulus is necessary in order to attenuate signal but not noise correlations. Moreover, we show that trial-to-trial variability in the spiking responses of neurons providing this feedback is necessary to attenuate noise but not signal correlations. Our model thus predicts that activation of the same feedback pathway can simultaneously reduce both signal and noise correlations through independent mechanisms. In agreement with modeling prediction, pharmacological inactivation led to a strong increase in both signal and noise correlations but the magnitude of the change in signal correlation was not related to the magnitude of the change in noise correlations. Our proposed mechanism for simultaneous control of both signal and noise correlations is generic and is thus likely to be applicable to the cerebellum and to other cerebellar-like structures.
