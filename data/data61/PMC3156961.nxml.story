Although topical glucocorticoids (GCs) display potent anti-inflammatory activity in inflamed skin, they also can exert numerous harmful effects on epidermal structure and function. In contrast, topical applications of ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) not only reduce inflammation, and also improve cutaneous barrier homeostasis. Therefore, we examined whether sequential topical GCs followed by topical Wy14643 (a ligand of PPARα) might be more effective than either alone for atopic dermatitis (AD) in a hapten (oxazolone)-induced, murine model with multiple features of AD (Ox-AD). Despite expected anti-inflammatory benefits, topical GC alone induced: i) epidermal thinning; ii) reduced expression of involucrin, loricrin and filaggrin; and iii) allowed outside-to-inside penetration of an epicutaneous tracer. While Wy14643 alone yielded significant therapeutic benefits in mice with mild or moderate Ox-AD, it was less effective in severe Ox-AD. Yet, topical applications of Wy14643 after GC was not only significantly effective comparable to GC alone, but it also prevented GC-induced structural and functional abnormalities in permeability barrier homeostasis. Moreover, rebound flares were largely absent after sequential treatment with GC and Wy14643. Together, these results show that GC and PPARα ligand therapy together is not only effective but also prevents development of GC-induced side effects, including rebound flares, in murine AD.
