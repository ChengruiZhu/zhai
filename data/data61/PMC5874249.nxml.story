Stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1)—a co-chaperone of heat shock proteins—promotes cell proliferation and may act as an oncogenic factor. Similarly, glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3β)-mediated phosphorylation of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1)—an epigenetic regulator—can contribute to the development of an aggressive cell phenotype. Owing to their ability to tether different molecules into functional complexes, scaffold proteins have a key role in the regulation of different signaling pathways in tumorigenesis. Here, we show that STIP1 acts as a scaffold promoting the interaction between LSD1 and GSK3β. Specifically, the TPR1 and TPR2B domains of STIP1 are capable of binding with the AOL domain of LSD1, whereas the TPR2A and TPR2B domains of STIP1 interact with the kinase domain of GSK3β. We also demonstrate that STIP1 is required for GSK3β-mediated LSD1 phosphorylation, which promoted LSD1 stability and enhanced cell proliferation. After transfection of cancer cells with double-mutant (S707A/S711A) LSD1, subcellular localization analysis revealed that LSD1 was translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In vitro experiments also showed that the LSD1 inhibitor SP2509 and the GSK3β inhibitor LY2090314 acted synergistically to induce cancer cell death. Finally, the immunohistochemical expression of STIP1 and LSD1 showed a positively correlation in human cancer specimens. In summary, our data provide mechanistic insights into the role of STIP1 in human tumorigenesis by showing that it serves as a scaffold for GSK3β-mediated LSD1 phosphorylation. The combination of LSD1 and GSK3β inhibitors may exert synergistic antitumor effects and deserves further scrutiny in preclinical studies.
