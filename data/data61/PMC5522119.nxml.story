Pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma (PNEC) is often misdiagnosed as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This retrospective study differentiated PNEC from PDAC using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including contrast-enhanced (CE) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Clinical data and MRI findings, including the T1/T2 signal, tumor boundary, size, enhancement degree, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), were compared between 37 PDACs and 13 PNECs. Boundaries were more poorly defined in PDAC than PNEC (97.3% vs. 61.5%, p<0.01). Hyper-/isointensity was more common in PNEC than PDAC at the arterial (38.5% vs. 0.0), portal (46.2% vs. 2.7%) and delayed phases (46.2% vs. 5.4%) (all p<0.01). Lymph node metastasis (97.3% vs. 61.5%, p<0.01) and local invasion/distant metastasis (86.5% vs. 46.2%, p<0.01) were more common in PDAC than PNEC. Enhancement degree via CE-MRI was higher in PNEC than PDAC at the arterial and portal phases (p<0.01). PNEC ADC values were lower than those of normal pancreatic parenchyma (p<0.01) and PDAC (p<0.01). Arterial and portal phase signal intensity ratios and ADC values showed the largest areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve and good sensitivities (92.1%–97.2%) and specificities (76.9%–92.3%) for differentiating PNEC from PDAC. Thus the enhancement degree at the arterial and portal phases and the ADC values may be useful for differentiating PNEC from PDAC using MRI.
