The incidence of complex diseases such as diabetes, asthma, and depression is almost epidemic in many countries and coincides with transition in lifestyles. Clearly this is a result of interaction between modern cultural and environmental factors with the genetic legacy of human history. To estimate the extent of the effects of environmental factors, including lifestyle and geography, on gene expression, we examined gene expression differentiation in peripheral blood leukocyte samples from three Moroccan Amazigh groups leading distinct ways of life: desert nomadic, mountain agrarian and coastal urban. Our data shows that as much as one third of the leukocyte transcriptome is associated with differences among the three regions. Network analysis implies that specific aspects of immune function are strongly affected by regional factors and may influence disease susceptibility. Genetic and methylation differentiation between the three regions is limited and is unlikely to explain the extent of the observed gene expression differentiation. Insight gained from this study highlights the impact transitions from traditional to modern lifestyles likely have on human disease susceptibility and further warrant the need to incorporate gene expression profiling alongside genetic association studies for the prediction of disease susceptibility.
