 133:169–184). Ectopic expression of the integrin α5 or α6A subunit in primary quail myoblasts either decreases or enhances the probability of cell cycle withdrawal, respectively. In this study, we addressed the mechanisms by which changes in integrin α subunit ratios regulate this decision. Ectopic expression of truncated α5 or α6A indicate that the α5 cytoplasmic domain is permissive for the proliferative pathway whereas the COOH-terminal 11 amino acids of α6A cytoplasmic domain inhibit proliferation and promote differentiation. The α5 and α6A cytoplasmic domains do not appear to initiate these signals directly, but instead regulate β1 signaling. Ectopically expressed IL2R-α5 or IL2R-α6A have no detectable effect on the myoblast phenotype. However, ectopic expression of the β1A integrin subunit or IL2R-β1A, autonomously inhibits differentiation and maintains a proliferative state. Perturbing α5 or α6A ratios also significantly affects activation of β1 integrin signaling pathways. Ectopic α5 expression enhances expression and activation of paxillin as well as mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase with little effect on focal adhesion kinase (FAK). In contrast, ectopic α6A expression suppresses FAK and MAP kinase activation with a lesser effect on paxillin. Ectopic expression of wild-type and mutant forms of FAK, paxillin, and MAP/erk kinase (MEK) confirm these correlations. These data demonstrate that (a) proliferative signaling (i.e., inhibition of cell cycle withdrawal and the onset of terminal differentiation) occurs through the β1A subunit and is modulated by the α subunit cytoplasmic domains; (b) perturbing α subunit ratios alters paxillin expression and phosphorylation and FAK and MAP kinase activation; (c) quantitative changes in the level of adhesive signaling through integrins and focal adhesion components regulate the decision of myoblasts to withdraw from the cell cycle, in part via MAP kinase.
