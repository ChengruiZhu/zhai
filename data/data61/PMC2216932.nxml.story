We studied the ionic mechanisms underlying the regulatory volume increase of rat hepatocytes in primary culture by use of confocal laser scanning microscopy, conventional and ion-sensitive microelectrodes, cable analysis, microfluorometry, and measurements of 86Rb+ uptake. Increasing osmolarity from 300 to 400 mosm/liter by addition of sucrose decreased cell volumes to 88.6% within 1 min; thereafter, cell volumes increased to 94.1% of control within 10 min, equivalent to a regulatory volume increase (RVI) by 44.5%. This RVI was paralleled by a decrease in cell input resistance and in specific cell membrane resistance to 88 and 60%, respectively. Ion substitution experiments (high K+, low Na+, low Cl-) revealed that these membrane effects are due to an increase in hepatocyte Na+ conductance. During RVI, ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake was augmented to 141% of control, and cell Na+ and cell K+ increased to 148 and 180%, respectively. The RVI, the increases in Na+ conductance and cell Na+, as well as the activation of Na+/K(+)-ATPase were completely blocked by 10(-5) mol/liter amiloride. At this concentration, amiloride had no effect on osmotically induced cell alkalinization via Na+/H+ exchange. When osmolarity was increased from 220 to 300 mosm/liter (by readdition of sucrose after a preperiod of 15 min in which the cells underwent a regulatory volume decrease, RVD) cell volumes initially decreased to 81.5%; thereafter cell volumes increased to 90.8% of control. This post-RVD-RVI of 55.0% is also mediated by an increase in Na+ conductance. We conclude that rat hepatocytes in confluent primary culture are capable of RVI as well as of post-RVD-RVI. In this system, hypertonic stress leads to a considerable increase in cell membrane Na+ conductance. In concert with conductive Na+ influx, cell K+ is then increased via activation of Na+/K(+)-ATPase. An additional role of Na+/H+ exchange in the volume regulation of rat hepatocytes remains to be defined.
