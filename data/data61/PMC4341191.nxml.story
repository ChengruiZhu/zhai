This article reviews the topic of how to identify and develop a removable partial denture (RPD) path of placement, and provides a literature review of the concept of the RPD path of placement, also known as the path of insertion. An optimal RPD path of placement, guided by mutually parallel guide planes, ensures that the RPD flanges fit intimately over edentulous ridge structures and that the framework fits intimately with guide plane surfaces, which prevents food collecting empty spaces between the intaglio surface of the framework and intraoral surfaces, and ensures that RPD clasps engage adequate numbers of tooth undercuts to ensure RPD retention. The article covers topics such as the causes of obstructions to RPD intra-oral seating, the causes of food collecting empty spaces that may exist around an RPD, and how to identify if a guide plane is parallel with the projected RPD path of placement. The article presents a method of using a surgical operating microscope, or high magnification (6-8x or greater) binocular surgical loupes telescopes, combined with co-axial illumination, to identify a preliminary path of placement for an arch. This preliminary path of placement concept may help to guide a dentist or a dental laboratory technician when surveying a master cast of the arch to develop an RPD path of placement, or in verifying that intra-oral contouring has aligned teeth surfaces optimally with the RPD path of placement. In dentistry, a well-fitting RPD reduces long-term periodontal or structural damage to abutment teeth.
