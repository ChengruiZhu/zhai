We reviewed 51 shoulders (40 ♀, 11♂) that underwent Latarjet coracoid transfer for the revision of failed previous arthroscopic instability repair. The avg. age was 32.6 yrs (16-58). All patients had recurrent symptomatic anterior instability after previous arthroscopic surgery, and avg. time from arthroscopic repair to Latarjet was 13 months (4-40 mn). All had either CT or MRI that revealed suture anchor material in the glenoid, labral and capsular stripping, and anteroinferior glenoid bone loss or erosion. Advanced bone loss percentage analysis was not performed for this study. We excluded all patients that had a previous open repair, a seizure disorder, or if the Latarjet was a primary procedure. Outcome scores pre-operatively avg: SST: 6.7 (1-12); VAS: 3 (0-8); ASES: 63 (32-89). Coracoid transfer was performed thru a subscapularis split in 38, and with tendon takedown in 13. The coracoid was osteotomized along its long axis parallel to the undersurface of the lateral aspect. This provided at least 2.5 to 3.5 cm of graft with the conjoined tendon attached. The coracoacromial (CA) ligament was incised leaving a 1 cm. stump. The transfer was affixed flush with the articular surface but not lateral to it, with two 3.5 mm cortical screws in lag fashion overdrilling the coracoid with the CA ligament directed laterally. The capsule was then repaired to the CA ligament to make the transfer extra-articular.
