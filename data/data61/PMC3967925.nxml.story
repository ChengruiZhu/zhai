Sequence-based protein homology detection has been extensively studied, but it remains very challenging for remote homologs with divergent sequences. So far the most sensitive methods employ HMM-HMM comparison, which models a protein family using HMM (Hidden Markov Model) and then detects homologs using HMM-HMM alignment. HMM cannot model long-range residue interaction patterns and thus, carries very little information regarding the global 3D structure of a protein family. As such, HMM comparison is not sensitive enough for distantly-related homologs. In this paper, we present an MRF-MRF comparison method for homology detection. In particular, we model a protein family using Markov Random Fields (MRF) and then detect homologs by MRF-MRF alignment. Compared to HMM, MRFs are able to model long-range residue interaction pattern and thus, contains information for the overall 3D structure of a protein family. Consequently, MRF-MRF comparison is much more sensitive than HMM-HMM comparison. To implement MRF-MRF comparison, we have developed a new scoring function to measure the similarity of two MRFs and also an efficient ADMM algorithm to optimize the scoring function. Experiments confirm that MRF-MRF comparison indeed outperforms HMM-HMM comparison in terms of both alignment accuracy and remote homology detection, especially for mainly beta proteins.
