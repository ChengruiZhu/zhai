Estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα) is a major therapeutic target of hormonal therapies in breast cancer and its expression in tumors is predictive of clinical response. Protein levels of ERα are tightly controlled by the 26S proteasome, yet how the clinical proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, impacts ERα regulation has not been studied. Bortezomib selectively inhibits the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome. Unlike other laboratory proteasome inhibitors, bortezomib failed to stabilize ERα protein at a dose exceeding 90% inhibition of the chymotrypsin-like activity. Unexpectedly, however, chronic bortezomib exposure caused a reduction of ERα levels in multiple ER+ breast cancer cell lines. This response can be explained by the fact that bortezomib induced a dramatic decrease in ERα mRNA due to direct transcriptional inhibition and loss of RNA polymerase II recruitment on the ERα gene promoter. Bortezomib treatment resulted in promoter-specific changes in estrogen-induced gene transcription that related to occupancy of ERα and RNA PolII on endogenous promoters. In addition, bortezomib inhibited estrogen-dependent growth in soft agar. These results reveal a novel link between proteasome activity and expression of ERα in breast cancer and uncover distinct roles of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome in the regulation of the ERα pathway.
