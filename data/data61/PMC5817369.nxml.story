-Hydroxycinnamoylphenalkylamides (36H) exhibited both antioxidation and antityrosinase abilities. The compound was studied for its antioxidative properties, using a 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazul- (DPPH-) scavenging test, a ferric ion-reducing antioxidant power assay (FRAP) assessment, and a metal-chelating power assay. The results showed that 36H had antioxidative capabilities in the DPPH-scavenging and ferric-reducing power examinations but the chelating power assay did not demonstrate antioxidative capability. 36H was also measured for tyrosinase inhibitory activity applying various species platforms, including in vitro mushroom, B16F10 mouse melanoma, and human melanocyte cells. In terms of in vitro mushroom tyrosinase suppression, 36H restrained the melanogenesis processes. It is assumed that 36H blocked the tyrosinase active site as a competitive inhibitor for mushroom tyrosinase, hence not decreasing the human normal melanocyte cellular viability. A quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot discovered that 36H downregulated melanogenesis-related RNA and proteins, including pigment production (MITF, tyrosinase, TRP-1, and TRP-2), melanosome maturation (Rab27a), and melanosome transportation (Myo5a, MLPH and Mreg). Overall, 36H displayed the biofunctions of antioxidation and melanin suppression, so there was a possibility for its application as a food additive or a skin-whitening agent.
