Primary enterolithiasis is a rare surgical ailment. The underlying cause is intestinal stasis. Numerous anatomical and micro environmental factors such as enteritis, incarcerated hernia, malignancy, diverticula, blind loops, and enteroenterostomy predispose to clinically significant concretions. Enterolithiasis in tuberculosis can be due to the presence of strictures, intestinal bands, or interbowel/parietal adhesions, leading to intestinal stasis. Secondary enterolithiasis is generally caused by gallstones or renal stones migrating to the gastrointestinal tract due to fistula formation. During stasis, food particles act as a nidus and calcium salts are deposited over the food particles, leading to stone formation. A 57-year-old male patient presented to the Emergency Department of Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, AMU, Aligarh, with features of intestinal obstruction. The patient underwent emergency laparotomy, revealing 2 strictures in the distal ileum with 15.24cm of the bowel between them containing a 2×2 cm enterolith. The strictured segment was resected, and end ileostomy and mucus fistula were created. The patient’s postoperative recovery was fine, and he wasdischarged with ileostomy on antitubercular treatment (after histopathologicalconfirmation). Ileostomy closure wasplanned after 6 weeks. The incidence and prevalence of enterolithiasis has been on the rise recently because of advancement in radiological imaging studies. Endoscopic and surgical stone removal along with the treatment of the underlying pathology is recommended.
