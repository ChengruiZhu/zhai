In a lipopolysaccharide‐induced state, expressions of transforming growth factor‐β, angiotensinogen and vascular endothelial growth factor were similarly increased. Transforming growth factor‐β and angiotensinogen levels originally elevated by lipopolysaccharide challenge were distinctly reduced after pre‐incubation with vitamin D. Whereas after vitamin D receptor small interfering (si)RNA transfection, the aforementioned cytokines had opposite changes as expected. However, neither vitamin D pretreatment nor vitamin D receptor siRNA transfection influenced the previously increased vascular endothelial growth factor expression at messenger RNA or protein levels. When pretreated with vitamin D, decreases were observed for phosphorylated inhibitor‐κB and the inhibitor kinase proteins. After siRNA transfection, those proteins levels were further elevated. The originally increased transforming growth factor‐β and angiotensinogen levels as a result of lipopolysaccharide stimulation were reduced at both the messenger RNA and protein levels after the specific inhibition of the nuclear factor‐κB pathway with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate. The apoptosis rate of podocytes was decreased in a parallel manner after vitamin D pre‐incubation, and increased after siRNA transfection, which was also suppressed by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate.
