The adhesive properties of Chinese hamster V79 cells were analyzed and characterized by various cell dissociation treatments. The comparisons of aggregability among cells dissociated with EDTA, trypsin + Ca2+, and trypsin + EDTA, revealed that these cells have two adhesion mechanisms, a Ca2+-independent and a Ca2+-dependent one. The former did not depend on temperature, whereas the latter occurred only at physiological temperatures. Both mechanisms were trypsin sensitive, but the Ca2+- dependent one was protected by Ca2+ against trypsinization. In morphological studies, the Ca2+-independent adhesion appeared to be a simple agglutination or flocculation of cells, whereas the Ca2+- dependent adhesion seemed to be more physiological, being accompanied by cell deformation resulting in the increase of contact area between adjacent cells. Lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination of cell surface proteins revealed that several proteins are more intensely labeled in cells with Ca2+-independent adhesiveness than in cells without that property. It was also found that a cell surface protein with a molecular weight of approximately 150,000 is present only in cells with Ca2+-dependent adhesiveness. The iodination and trypsinization of this protein were protected by Ca2+, suggesting its reactivity to Ca2+. Possible mechanisms for each adhesion property are discussed, taking into account the correlation of these proteins with cell adhesiveness.
