Accuracy of prediction of pelvic lymph node status using sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), and outcomes of SLNB-guided abdominal radical trachelectomy (ART) were assessed. Patients with stage IB1 (Figure 2009) cervical cancer and with tumors >2 cm were enrolled. Prior to fertility-sparing surgery 99mTc-labeled phytate was administered. SLNs were intraoperatively identified, excised, and assessed using fast-frozen sections. Systematic bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy with or without para-aortic lymphadenectomy was subsequently undertaken. The SLN detection rate was 91.8% (45/49 patients); 8.2% (4/49) had radical hysterectomies because of metastatic primary SLNs. All SLNs received routine immunopathological examination to detect micrometastasis. Sensitivity, accuracy, and false negative rates were 100%, 100%, and 0%, respectively. ART was successfully completed in 45 patients (median follow-up, 61 [range, 4â€“149] months). Three of the 45 (6.7%) were lost to follow-up; two relapsed and one died of tumor progression. Overall 3-year survival and progression-free survival rates were 97.6% and 95.2%, respectively. Of the 19 patients who attempted to conceive after surgery, five achieved pregnancy, and one had a live birth in the third trimester. We concluded that SLNB using 99mTc-labeled phytate can accurately assess pelvic node status. SLNB-guided ART is safe and feasible in patients selected for fertility-sparing procedures.
