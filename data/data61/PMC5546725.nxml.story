A major challenge in modern genomics research is to link the thousands of unstudied genes to the pathways and complexes within which they operate. A popular strategy to infer the function of an unstudied gene is to search for co-expressing genes of known function using a single transcriptional profiling dataset. Today, there are literally thousands of transcriptional profiling datasets, and a special opportunity lies in querying entire compendia for co-expression in order to more reliably expand pathway membership. Such analyses can be challenging, however, as pathways can be highly modular, and different datasets can conflict in terms of providing evidence of co-expression. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a tool called CLIC, CLustering by Inferred Co-expression. CLIC accepts a pathway of interest, simultaneously partitioning it into modules of genes that exhibit striking co-expression patterns while also learning the number of modules. It then expands each module with new members, based on an integrated weighted co-expression score across the datasets. Three key innovations within CLIC–partitioning, background correction, and integration–distinguish it from other methods. A side benefit of CLIC is that it spotlights the datasets that support the co-expression of a given co-expression module. Our software is freely available, and should be useful for identifying new genes in biological pathways while also identifying the datasets within which the pathways are active.
