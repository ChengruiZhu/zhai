Integrin-associated protein (CD47) is ubiquitously expressed on the surface of cells and functions as an identifier of self. In blood cancer, tumor cells expressing CD47 evade phagocytosis by macrophages, leading to a poor patient prognosis. However, the status of CD47 expression in solid tumors, particularly in gastric cancer, is not well understood. The purpose of the present study was to examine the level of CD47 in the primary tumor, peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) of patients with gastric cancer, and to determine its effect. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed to determine the level of CD47 mRNA expression in primary tumor, PB and BM samples collected from 168 patients with gastric cancer. Cell sorting was performed to investigate CD47 protein expression in PB and BM fractions, and to identify the source of CD47 expression. In primary tumors, the expression of CD47 was not associated with any clinicopathological factors or prognosis. By contrast, in PB, the low CD47 expression group demonstrated a significantly increased tumor size, and frequency of lymphatic invasion and lymph node metastasis, compared with the high CD47 expression group. In addition, the clinical tumor stage of the low CD47 expression group was significantly increased compared with that of the high CD47 expression group. Conversely, in PB, the high CD47 expression group had a significantly higher frequency of lymphatic invasion and lymph node metastasis compared with the low CD47 expression group. The lymphocyte fraction exhibited the highest CD47 expression compared with the other fractions in PB and BM samples. Low expression of CD47 was associated with the advancement of gastric cancer, in contrast to other cancers, and it may be associated with a decrease in lymphocytes during later stages. These results indicate that CD47 expression in the PB and BM may serve as a marker to analyze the immunological function of patients with gastric cancer; however, the significance of CD47 in gastric cancer requires further study.
