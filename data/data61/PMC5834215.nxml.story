In robotics, the shape and material properties of the robot body can be exploited to make central control processes simpler; this is known as “morphological computation.” In this view, the body is not a device to simply be controlled by the brain, but rather is directly involved in making some behaviors less complicated for the nervous system. We tested this idea in a real biological system by investigating how marmoset monkey infants change their vocal behavior over time. It would typically (and reasonably) be presumed that changes in vocal production are the result of learning and, thus, changes in the nervous system. However, using a computational model, we show that one major feature of developing vocal behavior—the decline in the production of context-inappropriate vocalizations—could simply be the result of lung growth (a change in body morphology) without any concomitant changes in central nervous system structure. We then tested the model predictions by placing the infants in a helium–oxygen (heliox) environment. This, in effect, simulated a reversal in lung growth and, as predicted, resulted in a reversion back to immature vocal behavior. Thus, morphological computation plays a role in vocal development. These data underscore the importance of considering the whole organism, not just the nervous system, when trying to understand how any behavior works or may go awry.
