 A 59-year-old Caucasian female with a history of endometrial cancer and bladder cancer with Lynch syndrome presented for evaluation of recurrent urothelial carcinoma. Her previous bladder tumors have been T1 high grade and Ta high grade and have been treated with resection and multiple cycles of intravesical Bacillus Calmetteâ€“Guerin (BCG) therapy. She had also undergone a robotic left distal ureterectomy and psoas hitch for a high-grade distal ureteral tumor. Surveillance cystoscopy 7 months after revealed a biopsy-confirmed bladder tumor, which was resected, and she was started on maintenance BCG therapy. At presentation, follow-up urine cytology and UroVysion studies were negative. Cxbladder test was also initially negative. However, during close clinical monitoring, the Cxbladder test became positive. Cystoscopy was once more performed, which was unremarkable. Bilateral ureteroscopy was performed, revealing high-grade upper tract renal papillary carcinoma (UTUC) in the left renal pelvis. The patient declined a nephroureterectomy. She was treated with two sessions of holmium laser ablation of the left renal pelvis tumor and underwent 6 weekly courses of BCG + interferon instilled into her left renal pelvis using a 5F open-ended catheter. Repeat urine cytology, UroVysion, and Cxbladder tests were negative after completion of upper tract BCG therapy.
