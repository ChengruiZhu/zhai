The aim of this study was to evaluate the proliferation rate and morphological changes of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells of canine and equine origin (Eq- and CaAdMSC). Investigated cells were exposed to a static magnetic field (MF) with the intensity of 0.5Â T. Proliferation activity of cells was determined with the Alamar Blue assay. Obtained results, normalized in respect to the control culture, showed that EqAdMSC exposed to MF maintained a high proliferation status, whereas proliferation activity of CaAdMSC cultured in the presence of MF was decreased. Estimations of population doubling time (PDT) also revealed that EqAdMSCs exposed to static MF achieved a twofold increase in the total number of cells in a shorter amount of time than the control culture. The PDT value obtained for investigated CaAdMSCs indicated that MF exposure resulted in the prolongation of population doubling time. Morphology of cells and cellular composition was investigated using a light inverted microscope and a fluorescent microscope. A scanning electron microscope was used for microvesicles (MVs) imaging. Obtained results showed that both cell types maintained fibroblastic morphology and did not reveal signs of apoptosis or necrosis. However, the MF had an influence on the MVs secretion. While EqAdMSCs propagated in the presence of MF were characterized by the abundant MVs presence, CaAdMSCs revealed poor secretory activity. The approach presented provides complex analysis, which enables one to determine changes in equine and canine cytophysiology.
