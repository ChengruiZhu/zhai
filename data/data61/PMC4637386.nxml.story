The function of IgD in fish and mammals has not been fully understood since its discovery. In this study, we have isolated and characterized the cDNA that encodes membrane-bound form of the immunoglobulin D heavy chain gene (mIgD) of blunt snout bream (Megalobrama amblycephala) using RT-PCR and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The full-length cDNA of mIgD consisted of 3313 bp, encoding a putative protein of 943 amino acids. The structure of blunt snout bream mIgD is VDJ-μ1-δ1-δ2-δ3-δ4-δ5-δ6-δ7-TM. Multiple alignment and phylogenetic analyses indicated that blunt snout bream mIgD clusters with the homologues of cyprinid fish and that its highest identity is with that of C. idella (82%). The mIgD expression in early different developmental stages showed that the level of mIgD mRNA decreased dramatically from the unfertilized egg stage to the 32-cell stage, suggesting that mIgD mRNA was maternally transferred. As cell differentiation initially took place in the blastula stage, the mIgD expression increased significantly from the blastula stage to prelarva, which might be attributed to embryonic stem cell differentiation processes. Compared with juvenile fish, the expression and tissue distribution patterns of mIgD in adult individuals exhibited considerable variation. After the injection of Aeromonas hydrophila, mIgD expression was up-regulated in various tissues, reaching the peak expression at 5 d, 14 d or 21 d (depending on the tissue type). The present study provides a theoretical basis for further research of the teleost immune system.
