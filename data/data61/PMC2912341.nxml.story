Sequence homology is a fundamental principle of biology. It implies common phylogenetic ancestry of genes and, subsequently, similarity of their protein products with regard to amino acid sequence, three-dimensional structure and molecular and cellular function. Originally an esoteric concept, homology with the proxy of sequence similarity is used to justify the transfer of functional annotation from well-studied protein examples to new sequences. Yet, functional annotation via sequence similarity seems to have hit a plateau in recent years since relentless annotation transfer led to error propagation across sequence databases; thus, leading experimental follow-up work astray. It must be emphasized that the trinity of sequence, 3D structural and functional similarity has only been proven for globular segments of proteins. For non-globular regions, similarity of sequence is not necessarily a result of divergent evolution from a common ancestor but the consequence of amino acid sequence bias. In our investigation, we found that protein domain databases contain many domain models with transmembrane regions and signal peptides, non-globular segments of proteins having hydrophobic bias. Many proteins have inherited completely wrong function assignments from these domain models. We fear that future function predictions will turn out futile if this issue is not immediately addressed.
