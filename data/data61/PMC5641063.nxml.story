Here we investigated the impact of WNT5A signaling on aerobic glycolysis and evaluated its effects on breast cancer cell migration/invasion. WNT5A signaling reduced migration and lactate production and caused selective down-regulation of the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase platelet-type (PFKP). These events occurred in parallel with a WNT5A-induced inhibition of β-catenin signaling. Support for essential involvement of β-catenin and PFKP in lactate production and migration/invasion was obtained by siRNA knockdown of their expression. To also explore the effect of non-tumor cell-derived lactate, we added exogenous lactate to the cells and noted an increase in migration that was significantly impaired by recombinant WNT5A in parallel with a down-regulation of the lactate transporter monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1). Interestingly enough, the drug-candidate Foxy5 (WNT5A-mimic hexapeptide) also inhibited breast cancer cell migration in the presence of exogenous lactate, suggesting a therapeutic potential for Foxy5 in managing breast tumors with high glycolytic activity. Overall, we demonstrated that WNT5A signaling (via a β-catenin-PFKP axis) reduces lactate production and lowers the expression of MCT1, a carrier mediating the uptake of lactate from the tumor microenvironment. These effects of WNT5A are essential for its ability to impair breast cancer migration/invasion even in an environment with elevated lactate levels.
