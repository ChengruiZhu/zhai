An average of three influenza pandemics occurred in each century over the last 300 years. As occurrence of the next influenza pandemic is definite, developing new antivirals is imperative since resistance to the remaining class of antivirals has been reported occasionally, and vaccines are ineffective in the initial wave of a pandemic. The typical evolutionary traits of viruses, which manifest as multiple virus subtypes in circulation and perpetual viral genomic mutations, require the development of subtype-specific antivirals that ultimately acquire resistance. Being a rapidly evolving and highly contagious virus that manifest the most subtypes, this is particularly acute for influenza A. Our approach to overcome these challenges is to identify and characterize influenza A virus sequences for RNA targeting that can theoretically address all strains from the most prevalent human-infecting subtypes (i.e. simultaneous multi-subtype targeting) that can hedge against antiviral resistance. We uncover an extensive list of target sequence pairs and their specific combinations for which they can be selected for novel therapeutics development that will be effective on multiple circulating seasonal strains and future pandemic strains. As our approach is applicable to other viruses, the methods are general for use in the selection of antiviral therapeutic targets.
