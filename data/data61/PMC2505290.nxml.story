The article we reproduce here reflects not only Smith-Petersen’s innovative thinking, but his willingness to accept challenge with a new approach [7]. In 1934 he began using suction-irrigation cannulae made of glass to allow intermittent irrigation in patients with osteomyelitis in whom the wounds had been tightly closed about the cannulae. For the time, when open packing of chronic osteomyelitis as advocated by Orr was a standard [1], Smith-Petersen’s approach was radical. He commented, “Several members of the Osteomyelitis Service did not look with favor upon this method of treatment, and the orthopaedic surgeon responsible for the treatment did not feel any too confident; consequently, the cases treated in this manner were few and far between, and progress was proportionally slow” [7]. He modified the cannulae design from round to oval to help prevent leakage and began constructing them from vitallium in 1938 to avoid breakage. Initially he used Dakin’s solution, but then tried a silver-pectinate solution, and in the year before publication (1945) began using penicillin. His willingness to continuously modify his approaches (exemplified with other innovations, including the tri-flanged nail [5] and mold arthroplasty [6]) attests to his sense of responsibility and humility. “A great responsibility,” he commented, “rests on the surgeon who introduces a new method of treatment. The desire to have a new idea published is so great that the originator is often led astray, and the method is broadcast before it has proved worthwhile, and before the technique has been perfected” [4].
