The purpose of this research is to achieve uniform spatial resolution in CT (computed tomography) images without hardware modification. The main idea of this study is to consider geometry optics model, which can provide the approximate blurring PSF (point spread function) kernel, which varies according to the distance from X-ray tube to each pixel. The FOV (field of view) was divided into several band regions based on the distance from X-ray source, and each region was deconvolved with different deconvolution kernels. Though more precise calculation for the PSF for deconvolution is possible as the number of subbands increases, we set the number of subbands to 11. 11 subband settings seem to be a balancing point to reduce noise boost, while MTF (modulation transfer function) increase still remains. As the results show, subband-wise deconvolution makes image resolution (in terms of MTF) relatively uniform across the FOV. The results show that spatial resolution in CT images can be uniform across the FOV without using additional equipment. The beauty of this method is that it can be applied to any CT system as long as we know the specific system parameters and determine the appropriate PSF for deconvolution maps of the system. The proposed algorithm shows promising result in improving spatial resolution uniformity while avoiding the excessive noise boost.
