The nuclear domain (ND)10 also described as POD or Kr bodies is involved in the development of acute promyelocytic leukemia and virus- host interactions. Immunofluorescence analysis using a variety of human autoimmune sera and monoclonal antibodies showed a typical dot like nuclear staining for ND10, suggesting that this structure consists of several proteins. Two of the ND10 proteins, Sp100 and PML are genetically characterized and show homology with several transcription factors. Here we describe NDP52, an additional novel protein of the ND10. We raised a new mAb C8A2, that specifically recognizes NDP52. Immunofluorescence analysis using this mAb showed a typical nuclear dot staining as it was described for ND10. Isolation and sequencing of the corresponding cDNA revealed that NDP52 has a predicted molecular mass of 52 kD. The deduced amino acid sequence exhibits an extended central coiled coil domain containing a leucine zipper motif. The COOH terminus of NDP52 shows homology with LIM domains, that have recently been described to mediate protein interactions, which let NDP52 appear as a suitable candidate for mediating interactions between ND10 proteins. In vivo, NDP52 is transcribed in all human tissues analyzed. Furthermore, we show that NDP52 colocalizes with the ND10 protein PML and can be redistributed upon viral infection and interferon treatment. These data suggest that ND10 proteins play an important role in the viral life cycle.
