The present study aimed to detect microRNA expression levels in the tissues and sera of patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). The association of microRNA expression with ccRCC clinical pathology was analyzed, and the potential of the microRNAs as ccRCC serum markers and the significance of their expression in the clinical diagnosis, staging, prognosis and selection of new therapeutic targets for ccRCC were discussed. Specific microRNAs were selected according to the associated literature. TaqMan quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) technology was used to determine the expression levels of selected microRNAs. miR-34a, miR-224 and miR-21 were upregulated, whereas miR-141, miR-149 and miR-429 were downregulated in the ccRCC tissues (P<0.01). The expression of miR-221 and miR-211 was not significant in the ccRCC tissues (P>0.05). miR-34a, miR-21 and miR-224 were upregulated and miR-141 was downregulated in the sera of patients with ccRCC (P<0.01), while the expression of miR-149 and miR-429 was not significant (P>0.05). The serum miR-21 expression levels were significantly correlated with the clinical staging of the patients with ccRCC (P<0.05). miR-34a, miR-21 and miR-224 are upregulated in the tissues and sera of patients with ccRCC, whereas miR-141 is downregulated. miR-21 and miR-141 are associated with ccRCC and are, thus, potential ccRCC serum markers.
