Numerous studies have suggested that there was a significantly positive association between circulating total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and survival in colorectal cancer patients. Moreover, plasma vitamin D was also found significantly associated with the concentration of vitamin D binding protein (VDBP). However, there was no paper to clarify the prognostic value of VDBP, free and bioavailable 25(OH)D in colorectal carcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to comprehensively assess the prognostic value of VDBP, total, free and bioavailable 25(OH)D in stage I-III colorectal cancer patients. A total of 206 colorectal cancer patients were enrolled in this prospective study. Preoperative plasma total 25(OH)D and VDBP concentrations were measured by direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and albumin concentration was measured by Beckman automatic biochemical analyzer. Free and bioavailable 25(OH)D concentrations were calculated based on the concentrations of plasma VDBP, total 25(OH) D and albumin. X-title program was used to determine the optimal cut-off values of VDBP, total, free and bioavailable 25(OH)D. Results showed that elevated free and bioavailable 25(OH)D were significantly associated with better 5-year overall survival (OS) by univariate analysis. By multivariate cox analysis, we also found that the high level of free 25(OH)D (HR = 0.442, 95%CI = 0.238â€“0.819,
