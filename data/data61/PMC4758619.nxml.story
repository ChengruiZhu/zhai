The neocortex is the main substrate of cognitive activity of the mammalian brain. During active wakefulness, it exhibits an oscillatory activity in the gamma range (30–80Hz), which is believed to play an important functional role and is altered in schizophrenic patients. Experimental studies have shown that gamma activity arises from the interaction of excitatory pyramidal neurons, the main neuronal type of the cortex, and local inhibitory neurons expressing the protein parvalbumin (PV). However, how these neuronal types behave during gamma activity remains largely unknown. Here, we recorded the intracellular activity of pyramidal and PV-expressing neurons in the visual cortex of awake mice while acquiring Local Field Potentials (LFPs)—extracellular voltage fluctuations within a small volume of the cortex—to monitor gamma activity. We found that gamma activity arises when PV-expressing neurons synchronize their output in response to a correlated input, reflecting the general activation of the local cortical network. This happens even in the absence of visual input. On the other hand, the output of pyramidal neurons only becomes entrained to gamma activity when the mice are exposed to visual stimulation. Thus, our results suggest that gamma activity synchronizes pyramidal neurons specifically when the cortex is engaged in processing external inputs.
