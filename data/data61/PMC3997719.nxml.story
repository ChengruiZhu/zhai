Previous studies have demonstrated that astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) is overexpressed in several cancer types and that its upregulation may promote cell proliferation, cell transformation and tumor progression. The present study investigated the expression and prognostic value of AEG-1 in primary gastric cancer (GC) as well as its role in angiogenesis. The results obtained from real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blotting revealed the upregulation of AEG-1 mRNA (P=0.007) and protein expression (P<0.001) in the majority of cancerous tissues compared with matched adjacent non-cancerous gastric tissues. To further investigate the clinicopathological and prognostic roles of AEG-1, immunohistochemical analysis of 216 GC tissue blocks was performed. The results showed that high AEG-1 expression closely correlated with differentiation degree (P<0.001 ), T stage (P<0.001), N stage (P=0.003) and M stage (P=0.013). Consistent with the abovementioned results, AEG-1 upregulation was also found to significantly correlate with poor survival in GC patients (P<0.001). Furthermore, carcinomas with elevated AEG-1 expression demonstrated high vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and microvessel density, which was labeled by cluster of differentiation 34. In addition, an AEG-1 siRNA assay in MGC-803 cells showed that the AEG-1 gene may promote VEGF and hypoxia-inducible factor-1Î± protein and mRNA expression. The results of the current study indicated that AEG-1 may serve as a valuable prognostic marker for GC and may be involved in regulating tumor angiogenesis.
