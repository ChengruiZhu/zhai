Chronic or intermittent hyperglycemia is associated with the development of diabetic complications. Several signaling pathways can be altered by having hyperglycemia in different tissues, producing oxidative stress, the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), as well as the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines and cellular death (pathological autophagy and/or apoptosis). However, the signaling pathways that are directly triggered by hyperglycemia appear to have a pivotal role in diabetic complications due to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative stress, and cellular death. The present review will discuss the role of cellular death in diabetic complications, and it will suggest the cause and the consequences between the hyperglycemia-induced signaling pathways and cell death. The signaling pathways discussed in this review are to be described step-by-step, together with their respective inhibitors. They involve diacylglycerol, the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and NADPH-oxidase system, and the consequent production of ROS. This was initially entitled the “dangerous metabolic route in diabetes”. The historical usages and the recent advancement of new drugs in controlling possible therapeutical targets have been highlighted, in order to evaluate the evolution of knowledge in this sensitive area. It has recently been shown that the metabolic responses to stimuli (i.e., hyperglycemia) involve an integrated network of signaling pathways, in order to define the exact responses. Certain new drugs have been experimentally tested—or suggested and proposed—for their ability to modulate the possible biochemical therapeutical targets for the downregulation of retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, heart disease, angiogenesis, oxidative stress, and cellular death. The aim of this study was to critically and didactically evaluate the exact steps of these signaling pathways and hence mark the indicated sites for the actions of such drugs and their possible consequences. This review will emphasize, besides others, the therapeutical targets for controlling the signaling pathways, when aimed at the downregulation of ROS generation, oxidative stress, and, consequently, cellular death—with all of these conditions being a problem in diabetes.
