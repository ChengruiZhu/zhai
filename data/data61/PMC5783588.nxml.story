Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer and a tumor with a broad spectrum of targeted therapies already available or in clinical trials. Thus, molecular characterization of the tumor using next generation sequencing (NGS) technology, has become a key tool for facilitating treatment decisions and the clinical management of NSCLC patients. The performance of a custom 23 gene multiplex amplification hot spot panel, based on Ion AmpliSeq™ technology, was evaluated for the analysis of tumor DNA extracted from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. Furthermore, the Ion AmpliSeq™ RNA Fusion Lung Cancer Research Panel was used for fusion RNA transcript analysis. The mutation spectrum of the tumors was determined in a cohort of 502 patients with NSCLC using the aforementioned targeted gene panels. The panel used for tumor DNA analysis in this study exhibited high rates (100%) of sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility at a mutation allelic frequency of 3%. At least one DNA mutation was detected in 374 patients (74.5%) and an RNA fusion was identified in 16 patients, (3.2%). In total, alterations in a cancer-driver gene were identified (including point mutations, gene rearrangements and MET amplifications) in 77.6% of the tumors tested. Among the NSCLC patients, 23% presented a mutation in a gene associated with approved or emerging targeted therapy. More specifically, 13.5% (68/502) presented a mutation in a gene with approved targeted therapy
