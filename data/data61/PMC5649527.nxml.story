Osteosarcoma (OS) is a common cancerous bone tumor which has a detrimental impact on the lives of patients and their families. The present study aimed at investigating the underlying molecular mechanism of various drug treatments pertaining to OS, including dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), doxorubicin (DXP), Nutlin-3, actinomycin D (ActD) and etoposide (Eto). Microarray and p53 chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with sequencing (ChIP-seq) datasets of the OS cell line U2OS treated with distinct drugs were acquired from the Gene Expression Omnibus and differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) were screened for alignment analysis. The p53-binding target genes were identified and ChIP-seq and microarray gene expression data were combined to identify directly and indirectly targeted genes. A regulatory network of p53 was constructed with the acquired data. Finally, the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery was interrogated for annotation of target genes. A total of 212 p53-binding peaks were obtained in the untreated group, whereas thousands of peaks were obtained in the treated groups. In total, ~1,000 target genes were identified in each of DXP, DMSO, Eto and ActD treatment groups, whereas the Nutlin-3 treatment group identified an increased number, with 5,458 target genes obtained. Several common DEGs including
