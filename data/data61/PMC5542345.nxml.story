The treatment of a single dose of 0.3% or 0.6% ketorolac demonstrated a significant increase of cell death (0.3% concentration = 16.28% ± 1.26 loss of viability, p < .0001; 0.6% concentration= 41.88 ± 13.42, p < .05) compared to saline control (4.71% ± 1.21). All tested concentrations of meperidine exhibited significant chondrotoxicity (0.5% concentration = 13.61% ± 1.80 loss of viability, p < .01; 1% concentration= 80.53% ± 10.26, p = .001; 1.5% concentration= 89.53% ± 11.00, p < .001). Additionally, ketorolac exhibited a significant dose-response on cell death between 0.3% and 0.6% (p < .05), and higher ranges of meperidine had significant impact on survival (1%, p < .005; 1.5%, p < .005) compared to 0.5% concentration. Treatment with any concentration of fentanyl (0.0005% concentration= 6.13% ± 2.85; 0.001% concentration= 6.02% ± 3.03) or morphine (0.01% concentration= 6.40% ± 1.00; 0.02% concentration= 7.51% ± 2.08; 0.04% concentration= 8.37% ± 2.33) had no significant effect on cell death compared to saline controls. The fentanyl treatments showed no significant difference compared to saline controls up to 8 days with correlation coefficient at 0.1 for concentration = 0.01%, 0.3 for concentration = 0.02%, and -0.5 for concentration = 0.04%. The treatment of morphine exhibited a similar result with no significant difference between the experimental group and saline with correlation coefficient at 0.9 for concentration = 0.0005%, and 0.6 for concentration = 0.001%.
