Ubiqitinated and TDP-43 immunoreactive cytoplasmic aggregates are hallmark features of ALS molecular pathology. Since clinically most ALS begins focally and advances contiguously, it is important to characterize their distribution. Our objective was to determine the extent and distribution of TDP-43 immunoreactive aggregates in the lower motor neuron columns as a function of disease onset, and to correlate ubiquitinated with TDP-43 aggregates in the lumbar region. We examined TDP-43 cytoplasmic aggregates at four separate neuraxis levels – hypoglossal nucleus and cervical, thoracic, and lumbar anterior horns – in five controls and 20 sporadic ALS nervous systems from patients whose disease began in various sites, i.e. five bulbar, five arm, five trunk, and five leg onsets. We correlated ubiquitinated to TDP-43 aggregates on adjacent histological sections for the lumbar regions. We found that TDP-43 cytoplasmic aggregates are seen in about 8% of motor neurons but there is marked variability between nervous systems, ranging from 0.4% to 20.6%. The aggregates are uniformly distributed within individual nervous systems. There is no obvious correlation between site of disease onset and rate of spread. Almost all ubiquitinated aggregates correlate to TDP-43 aggregates. Thus, TDP-43 immunoreactive cytoplasmic aggregates have a low overall average frequency that does not correlate with either disease course or clinical spread and is the prime ubiquitinated protein.
