Macrophages from mice bearing large D1-DMBA-3 mammary tumors have a decreased capacity to kill tumor targets. This effect is due to an impaired ability to produce nitric oxide (NO) in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Here we report that the DA-3 tumor cell line, derived from the in vivo adenocarcinoma D1-DMBA-3, produces a factor that inhibits both NO production/release and cytotoxicity of LPS-activated peritoneal exudate macrophages (PEM). However, other complex macrophage functions such as phagocytosis, superoxide production, mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity, and synthesis of proteins were not reduced by this factor. The NO inhibitor has been found to be lipid in nature. Lipid extracts from DA-3 cell culture supernatants were purified by repeated silica gel column chromatography. The active molecule was unambiguously characterized as phosphatidyl serine (PS) by fast atom bombardment tandem mass spectrometry. Preliminary results indicate a lack of induced NO synthase (iNOS) activity in the lysates of LPS-activated PEM pretreated with PS. The ubiquity of PS in the inner leaflet of biological membranes and its NO inhibitory property, suggest that this phospholipid may be one of the long elusive molecules responsible for regulating physiological levels of NO in the host and hence preventing cellular dysfunction and/or tissue damage. Furthermore, the possible overexpression and shedding of PS by DA-3 tumor cells may represent a novel mechanism to impair macrophage cytotoxicity, a host function that contributes to the protection against developing neoplasms.
