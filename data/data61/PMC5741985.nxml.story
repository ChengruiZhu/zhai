This study aimed to analyze epigenetically and genetically altered genes in melanoma to get a better understanding of the molecular circuitry of melanoma and identify potential gene targets for the treatment of melanoma. The microarray data of GSE31879, including mRNA expression profiles (seven melanoma and four melanocyte samples) and DNA methylation profiles (seven melanoma and five melanocyte samples), were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were screened using the linear models for microarray data (limma) package in melanoma compared with melanocyte samples. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis of the DEGs were carried out using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery. Moreover, differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were identified, and a transcriptional regulatory network was constructed using the University of California Santa Cruz genome browser database. A total of 1,215 DEGs (199 upregulated and 1,016 downregulated) and 14,094 DMPs (10,450 upregulated and 3,644 downregulated) were identified in melanoma compared with melanocyte samples. Additionally, the upregulated and downregulated DEGs were significantly associated with different GO terms and pathways, such as pigment cell differentiation, biosynthesis, and metabolism. Furthermore, the transcriptional regulatory network showed that DMGs such as Aristaless-related homeobox (
