Treatment of stage 5 Xenopus embryos with the ionophore A23187 for only 10 min, in the absence of extracellular Mg2+ and Ca2+, causes cortical contractions and a high incidence of abnormal embryos during subsequent development. Cation analysis shows that divalent ions are not lost from the embryos, but that Ca2+ is redistributed within the subcellular fractions. Ca2+ is probably released from yolk platelets and/or pigment granules by the action of A23187, [Ca2+] rises in the cytosol, and the mitochondria attempt to take up this free Ca2+. The mitochondria concomitantly undergo characteristic ultrastructural transformations, changing towards energized-twisted and energized-zigzag conformations. A23187 allows these changes to be demonstrated in situ. Extracellular divalent cations (10(-4) M) interfere with this intracellular action of A23187. Intracellular accumulation of Na+ (by treatment with ouabain) or Li+ also causes abnormal development, probably by promoting a release of Ca2+ from the mitochondria. It is suggested (a) that all these treatments cause a rise in [Ca2+]i which interferes with normal, integrated cell division, so causing, in turn, abnormal embryogenesis, (b) that levels of [Ca2+]i are of importance in regulating cleavage, (c) that the mitochondria could well have a function in regulating [Ca2+]i during embryogenesis in Xenopus, and (d) that vegetalizing agents may well act by promoting a rise in [Ca2+]i in specific cells in the amphibian embryo.
