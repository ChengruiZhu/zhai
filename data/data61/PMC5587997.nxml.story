Curcumin is an anticancer compound that exerts anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects via multiple molecular targets. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the anticancer effects of curcumin in combination with 5-fluorouracil plus cisplatin (FP) on the MGC-803 human gastric cancer cell line. Following treatment with curcumin and/or FP for 24, 48 and 72 h, cell viability, cell cycle progression and the apoptosis rate were evaluated using an MTT assay, flow cytometry and dual acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining, respectively. In addition, colony formation, Transwell migration and caspase-3/caspase-8 activity assays were performed. The expression of the apoptosis regulator B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) were detected by western blotting analysis. Following treatment with curcumin and/or FP, cell viability, colony formation and cell migration were significantly reduced compared with the untreated control group. The rate of apoptosis, caspase-3/caspase-8 activity and the expression of Bax were significantly increased, whereas Bcl-2 expression was significantly reduced following treatment with curcumin and/or FP, compared with the untreated control group. The efficacy of curcumin combined with low-dose FP was significantly increased, compared with that of curcumin combined with high-dose FP (P<0.05). Therefore, curcumin may enhance the anticancer effects of FP chemotherapy in MGC-803 cells through the promotion of apoptosis via the caspase-3/caspase-8, Bcl-2 and Bax signaling pathways. These results suggest that curcumin may serve as a synergistic drug with chemotherapy regimen FP for the treatment of gastric cancer.
