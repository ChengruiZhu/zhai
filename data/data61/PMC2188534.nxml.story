The rearrangement and expression of human T cell receptor (TCR)-gamma and -delta gene segments in clonal and polyclonal populations of early fetal and postnatal human TCR-gamma/delta thymocytes were examined. The data suggest that the TCR-gamma and -delta loci rearrange in an ordered and coordinated fashion. Initial rearrangements at the TCR-delta locus join V delta 2 to D delta 3, and initial rearrangements at the TCR- gamma locus join downstream V gamma gene segments (V gamma 1.8 and V gamma 2) to upstream J gamma gene segments associated with C gamma 1. These rearrangements are characterized by minimal junctional diversity. At later times there is a switch at the TCR-delta locus such that V delta 1 is joined to upstream D delta gene segments, and a switch at the TCR-gamma locus such that upstream V gamma gene segments are joined to downstream J gamma gene segments associated with C gamma 2. These rearrangements are characterized by extensive junctional diversity. Programmed rearrangement explains in part the origin of discrete subpopulations of peripheral blood TCR-gamma/delta lymphocytes that have been defined in previous studies. In addition, cytokine production by early fetal and postnatal TCR-gamma/delta thymocyte clones was examined. Fetal thymocyte clones produced significant levels of IL-4 and IL-5 following stimulation, whereas postnatal thymocyte clones did not produce these cytokines. Thus, these cell populations may represent functionally distinct subsets as well.
