Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can control, but not cure, HIV infection. By decreasing the viral load, ART not only improves the health of HIV-positive individuals, but also reduces their infectiousness. Consequently, experts believe that scaling up ART could substantially reduce the rate of new HIV infections. But the successful implementation of “treatment as prevention” faces several challenges. Notably, HIV testing and treatment programs need to be widely available, and people who are HIV-positive need to adhere to ART. Another major challenge that faces treatment as prevention is that HIV transmission that occurs during the acute phase of infection is likely to evade the intervention, and it is widely accepted that HIV-positive individuals are highly infectious during this phase of infection. However, acute phase infectivity has been directly measured only once: in a retrospectively identified group of serodiscordant heterosexual couples (couples in which only one partner was HIV-positive) in Rakai, Uganda. The authors of the current study found that existing estimates of acute phase infectivity failed to take account of important aspects of the Rakai study design or of heterogeneity (variability) in infectiousness or susceptibility among the study participants. Here, the researchers use mathematical modeling to compare simulated cohorts with the Rakai data to provide new estimates of the duration and relative infectivity of the acute phase that take into account study design and heterogeneity.
