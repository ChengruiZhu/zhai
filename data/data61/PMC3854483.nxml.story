Investigation of the effects of nanomaterials on biological systems is crucial due to the increasing exposure to nanostructured materials with the growing developments and applications of nanotechnology in everyday life. Nanoparticles have been shown to have an effect on protein structure and interfere with protein self-assembly leading to the development of amyloid fibrils responsible for many debilitating diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and prion related diseases. Computational techniques enable investigation of such systems at the atomistic and electronic levels providing insight into properties not available from experiments. We employ a novel combination of computational methods, including large-scale electronic structure calculations and classical molecular dynamics to investigate the behavior of amyloidogenic apoC-II peptide in the presence of carbonaceous nanoparticles, the most prevalent form of nanoparticles found in the environment. Our results showed that carbon nanoparticles have significant effects on the peptide structure, dynamics and binding affinity. Specifically, the dimensionality and curvature of the nanomaterial can either facilitate or hinder their interaction with amyloidogenic peptides and make them adopt conformations capable of inhibiting or promoting fibril growth. These findings are important for rational design of amyloid fibril inhibitors as well as the elucidation of possible toxic effects of carbon based nanomaterials.
