) 100% efficacy against HPV16/18/31/33/45/52/58 was added, as were a range of screening scenarios appropriate to the UK. To benchmark cost‐benefits of screening for vaccinated women, we evaluated the proportion of cancers prevented per additional screen (incremental benefit) of current cytology and likely HPV screening scenarios in unvaccinated women. Slightly more cancers are prevented through vaccination with no screening (70.3%, 95% CR: 65.1–75.5) than realistic compliance to the current UK screening programme in the absence of vaccination (64.3%, 95% CR: 61.3–66.8). In unvaccinated women, when switching to HPV primary testing, there is no loss in effectiveness when doubling the screening interval. Benchmarking supports screening scenarios with incremental benefits of ≥2.0%, and rejects scenarios with incremental benefits ≤0.9%. In HPV16/18‐vaccinated women, the incremental benefit of offering a third lifetime screen was at most 3.3% (95% CR: 2.2–4.5), with an incremental benefit of 1.3% (−0.3–2.8) for a fourth screen. For HPV16/18/31/33/45/52/58‐vaccinated women, two lifetime screens are supported. It is important to know women's vaccination status; in these simulations, HPV16/18‐vaccinated women require three lifetime screens, HPV16/18/31/33/45/52/58‐vaccinated women require two lifetime screens, yet unvaccinated women require seven lifetime screens.
