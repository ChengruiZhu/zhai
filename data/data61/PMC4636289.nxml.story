Although fidelity of information transfer has a substantial impact on cellular survival, many steps in protein production are strikingly error-prone. Such errors during protein synthesis can have a substantial influence on viability and the onset of genetic diseases. These considerations raise the question as to how organisms can tolerate errors during protein synthesis. In this paper, for the first time, we study organisms’ capacity to evolve robustness against mistranslation and explore the underlying cellular mechanisms. A mutant yeast strain was engineered to translate a codon ambiguously (mistranslation). This thereby overloads the protein quality-control pathways and disrupts cellular protein homeostasis. This strain was used to study the capacity of the yeast genome to compensate for the deleterious effects of protein mistranslation. We found that mistranslation led to rapid evolution of genomic rearrangements, including chromosomal duplications and deletions. By altering the dosages of numerous, functionally related proteins simultaneously, these genetic changes introduce large phenotypic leaps that enable adaptation to mistranslation. Robustness against mistranslation during laboratory evolution was achieved through acceleration of protein turnover—a process that was determined by the combined rates of protein synthesis and ubiquitin-proteasome system-mediated degradation. However, as both translation and active degradation of proteins are exceptionally energy-consuming cellular processes, accelerated proteome turnover has substantial energy costs.
