The Community Structureâ€“Activity
Resource (CSAR) recently
held its first blinded exercise based on data provided by Abbott,
Vertex, and colleagues at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. A
total of 20 research groups submitted results for the benchmark exercise
where the goal was to compare different improvements for pose prediction,
enrichment, and relative ranking of congeneric series of compounds.
The exercise was built around blinded high-quality experimental data
from four protein targets: LpxC, Urokinase, Chk1, and Erk2. Pose prediction
proved to be the most straightforward task, and most methods were
able to successfully reproduce binding poses when the crystal structure
employed was co-crystallized with a ligand from the same chemical
series. Multiple evaluation metrics were examined, and we found that
RMSD and native contact metrics together provide a robust evaluation
of the predicted poses. It was notable that most scoring functions
underpredicted contacts between the hetero atoms (i.e., N, O, S, etc.)
of the protein and ligand. Relative ranking was found to be the most
difficult area for the methods, but many of the scoring functions
were able to properly identify Urokinase actives from the inactives
in the series. Lastly, we found that minimizing the protein and correcting
histidine tautomeric states positively trended with low RMSD for pose
prediction but minimizing the ligand negatively trended. Pregenerated
ligand conformations performed better than those that were generated
on the fly. Optimizing docking parameters and pretraining with the
native ligand had a positive effect on the docking performance as
did using restraints, substructure fitting, and shape fitting. Lastly,
for both sampling and ranking scoring functions, the use of the empirical
scoring function appeared to trend positively with the RMSD. Here,
by combining the results of many methods, we hope to provide a statistically
relevant evaluation and elucidate specific shortcomings of docking
methodology for the community.
