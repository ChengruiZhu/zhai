The gradient of activity produced along the olfactory mucosa by odorant stimulation was measured by the ratio (the LB/MB ratio) of the summated neural discharges recorded from two branches of the olfactory nerve, a lateral branch (LB) supplying a mucosal region near the internal naris and a medial branch (MB) supplying a region near the external naris. Twenty-four frogs "sniffed" sixteen different odorants, each odorant at four concentrations and two flow rates. Increases in concentration and flow rate produced statistically reliable increases in the ratios; the magnitude of these increases was considerably smaller than the magnitude of the statistically significant changes that could be achieved by shifting the odorants themselves. Even the small change due to concentration depended upon the odorant presented. Thus, even at the highest physiologically possible concentrations and flow rates, the general level of the activity gradient along the mucosa appeared to be determined mainly by the particular odorant used. The relative retention time of each of these 16 different odorants was measured in a gas chromatograph fitted with a Carbowax 20M column. In general, the longer the odorant's retention time the smaller its LB/MB ratio. This suggests that the different mucosal gradients of activity are established for different odorants by a chromatographic process. The data further suggest that the mucosa behaves like a polar chromatographic column.
