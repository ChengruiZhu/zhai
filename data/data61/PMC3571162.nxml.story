Experiences in most of the countries targeted reflect a trend moving away from pilot projects towards IPHS large scale-deployment at regional level aiming at potentially widespread diffusion at national level. Many identified drivers and barriers as well as push and pull factors are common across experiences and settings. Others are specific to each setting due to contextual factors and the nature of each health and social care system. The experiences were analysed using the three-axis framework: Innovation, Governance and Impact. Findings from an innovation perspective, for instance, identified interoperability as a barrier to be overcome. A trend towards convergence between telecare and telehealth applications was also identified. From a governance perspective, a variety of issues to be addressed was identified. Defining appropriate incentives aligned across tiers of care was identified as a governance issue to be addressed. Some experiences in Italy or Andaluc√≠a (Spain) provide interesting approaches in this regard. Further, the lack of an enabling legal framework was often translated into liability concerns for healthcare professionals. In turn, this translated into higher resistance to adopt these technologies. From an impact perspective, although evidence is often limited, this does not always prevent stakeholders from wider IPHS deployment. In addition, in some cases (i.e. Catalonia), the involvement of the HTA agency has assisted in the evaluation and dissemination of results. Thus, these organisations can play a relevant role in promoting IPHS adoption by introducing rigour into the evaluation methods and by consolidating evidence on the topic.
