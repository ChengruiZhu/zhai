Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is an attractive death ligand in targeted cancer therapy. Many cancer cells are refractory to TRAIL-induced cell death and the mechanisms underlying resistance are unclear. The molecular mechanisms of HCC and gastric cancer cells resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis were explored using molecular biological and immunological methods. In vivo experiments were conducted to study the effect of interferon stimulated gene 12a (ISG12a) on human liver cancer xenografts in mice. ISG12a decreases in TRAIL-resistant cancer cells. ISG12a regulates the sensitivity of cancer cells to TRAIL in vitro and in vivo. MicroRNA-942 (miR-942) is inversely correlated with ISG12a expression in cancer cells and tissues. Forced expression of miR-942 in TRAIL-sensitive cells significantly reduces endogenous ISG12a level and changes the TRAIL sensitive phenotype to a resistant one. Knockdown of miR-942 expression in TRAIL-resistant cells restores the expression of ISG12a and sensitizes the cells to TRAIL treatment. AKT control TRAIL resistance of cancer cells through downregulation of ISG12a by miR-942. Downregulation of ISG12a by miR-942 is needed to maintain the TRAIL-resistant phenotype of cancer cells and favors cancer cell survival. MiR-942 may offer a novel drug response marker with important implications in designing new therapeutics for
