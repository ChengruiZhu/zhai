Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer related deaths worldwide. But no one type of serum biomarker was found to be highly sensitive and specific for detection of lung cancer at present. So, the aim of this study was to evaluate a diagnostic value of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), neuron specific enolase (NSE) and matrix metallo-proteinase (MMP-9) for non-small cell lung cancer. Thirty-six cases with pathology confirmed non-small cell lung cancer and thirty-two of subjects with benign lung disease were reviewed in our hospital and included in this retrospective study. The serum level of CEA, NSE and MMP-9 were tested and compared between the non-small cell lung cancer patients and benign lung disease. The diagnosis sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for serum CEA, NSE and MMP-9 were calculated with STATA10.0 software. The serum CEA, NSE and MMP-9 were 32.0±16.7 ng/mL, 51.6±68.3 ng/mL, 30.6 ±15.7 μg/L for the NSCLC patients and 15.1±10.9 ng/mL, 4.9±3.1 ng/mL, 9.3±5.9 μg/L for the benign lung disease patients with statistical difference (Pall<0.05); The diagnosis sensitivity, specificity and AUC were 80.0%, 72.2%, 0.84 for the serum CEA; 71.0%, 83.3% and 0.80 for NSE and 87.1%, 80.56%, 0.89 for MMP-9, respectively. The serum CEA, NSE and MMP-9 were generally elevated in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and could be used as potential bio-markers for non-small cell lung cancer diagnosis.
