Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disorder of the vasculature that is orchestrated by the action of cytokines. Macrophages play a prominent role in all stages of this disease, including foam cell formation, production of reactive oxygen species, modulation of the inflammatory response and the regulation of the stability of atherosclerotic plaques. The role of the matrix metalloproteinase family in the control of plaque stability is well established. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motif (ADAMTS) family has been implicated in several diseases and the expression of ADAMTS-4 in macrophages of atherosclerotic lesions has suggested a potential role for this protease in atherosclerosis. However, the action of cytokines on the expression of ADAMTS-4 in macrophages is poorly understood. We have investigated here the effect of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) on ADAMTS-4 expression in macrophages along with the regulatory mechanisms underlying its actions. Consistent with the anti-atherogenic role of TGF-β, this cytokine decreased the expression of ADAMTS-4 mRNA and protein in human macrophages. Transient transfection assays showed that the −100 to +10 promoter region contained the minimal TGF-β response elements. Small-interfering RNA-mediated knockdown revealed a critical role for Smads, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun in the action of TGF-β on ADAMTS-4 mRNA expression. These studies show for the first time that TGF-β inhibits the expression of ADAMTS-4 in human macrophages and identifies the signalling pathways underlying this response. The inhibition of macrophage ADAMTS-4 expression is likely to contribute to the anti-atherogenic, plaque stabilisation action of TGF-β.
