The aim of this study was to explore the T helper 1 (Th1)/Th2 cytokine shift and its clinical significance in the peripheral blood and tumor tissues of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. In total, 124 NSCLC patients who were admitted to Xinxiang Central Hospital were selected, along with 124 healthy individuals undergoing physical examination at the same hospital during this period (as controls). ELISA was conducted to detect the Th1 and Th2 cytokine levels in the peripheral blood of patients in the two groups prior to and following radical surgery treatment. In addition, the Th1 and Th2 cytokine levels in the peripheral blood of the observation group were measured following surgery to analyze the correlation between relapse and survival. Compared with the control group, interleukin 4 (IL-4) and IL-10 concentrations in the peripheral blood of the observation group, prior to and following surgery, were significantly higher, whilst IL-2 and interferon-γ (INF-γ) concentrations were significantly lower (P<0.05). In the observation group, the IL-4 and IL-10 concentrations were significantly decreased following surgery, as compared with prior to surgery (P<0.05), whilst the IL-2 and INF-γ concentrations increased significantly (P<0.05). The one- and three-year cumulative relapse frequencies of patients with postoperative IL-4 abnormalities were significantly increased compared with those in patients with normal IL-4 levels following surgery (P<0.05), and the median survival time and survival rate significantly decreased in patients with postoperative IL-4 abnormalities (P<0.05). In terms of the three-year cumulative relapse rate, median survival time, and one- and three-year cumulative survival rate, patients with postoperative IL-2, IL-10 and INF-γ level abnormalities did not present any statistical significance compared with those without such abnormalities (P>0.05). In conclusion, Th2 cytokines dominate the peripheral blood of NSCLC patients and radical surgery treatment may improve the Th1/Th2 shift in patients. Furthermore, postoperative IL-4 levels were observed to correlate with relapse and the survival rate of patients; therefore, IL-4 may be considered as an auxiliary in the postoperative diagnosis during clinical practice.
