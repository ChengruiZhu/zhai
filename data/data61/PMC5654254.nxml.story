Our study aimed firstly to observe whether ALDH2 was expressed in neonate rat cardiac fibroblasts, then to investigate the effect of activation of ALDH2 on oxidative stress, apoptosis, and fibrosis when cardiac fibroblasts were subjected to high glucose intervention. Cultured cardiac fibroblasts were randomly divided into normal (NG), NG + Alda-1, high glucose (HG), HG + Alda-1, HG + Alda-1 + daidzin, HG + daidzin, and hypertonic groups. Double-label immunofluorescence staining, RT-PCR, and Western blot revealed ALDH2 was expressed in cardiac fibroblasts. Compared with NG, ALDH2 activity and protein expression were reduced, and cardiac fibroblast proliferation, ROS releasing, 4-HNE protein expression, collagen type I and III at mRNA levels, and the apoptosis rate were increased in HG group. While in HG + Alda-1 group, with the increases of ALDH2 activity and protein expression, the cardiac fibroblast proliferation and ROS releasing were decreased, and 4-HNE protein expression, collagen type I and III at mRNA levels, and apoptosis rate were reduced compared with HG group. When treated with daidzin in HG + Alda-1 group, the protective effects were inhibited. Our findings suggested that ALDH2 is expressed in neonate rat cardiac fibroblasts; activation of ALDH2 decreases the HG-induced apoptosis and fibrosis through inhibition of oxidative stress.
