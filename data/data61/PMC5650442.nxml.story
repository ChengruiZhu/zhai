Recent studies have showed that the transforming acidic coiled coil 3 (TACC3), was aberrantly up-regulated in various solid tumors and was reported to be correlated with unfavorable prognosis in cancer patients. This study aimed to examine the relationship between TACC3 and relevant clinical outcomes. Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase and Cochrane Library were systematically searched to obtain all eligible articles. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate the influence of TACC3 expression on overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in solid tumors patients. A total of 1943 patients from 11 articles were included. The result indicated that a significantly shorter OS was observed in patients with high expression level of TACC3 (HR=1.90, 95% CI=1.63–2.23). In the subgroup analysis, the association was also observed in patients with cancers of digestive system (HR=1.85, 95% CI=1.53–2.24). Statistical significance was also observed in subgroup meta-analysis stratified by the cancer type, analysis type and sample size. Furthermore, poorer DFS was observed in patients with high expression level of TACC3 (HR=2.67, 95% CI=2.10–3.40). Additionally, the pooled odds ratios (ORs) showed that increased TACC3 expression was also related to positive lymph node metastasis (OR=1.68, 95% CI=1.26–2.25), tumor differentiation (OR=1.90, 95% CI=1.25–2.88) and TNM stage (OR=1.66, 95% CI=1.25-2.20). In conclusion, the increased expression level of TACC3 was associated with unfavorable prognosis, suggesting that it was a valuable prognosis biomarker or a promising therapeutic target of solid tumors. Further studies should be conducted to confirm the clinical utility of TACC3 in human solid tumors.
