Expansion of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) used in clinical practices may be associated with accumulation of genetic instability. Understanding temporal and mechanistic aspects of this process is important for improving stem cell therapy protocols. We used γH2AX foci as a marker of a genetic instability event and quantified it in MSCs that undergone various numbers of passage (3-22). We found that γH2AX foci numbers increased in cells of late passages, with a sharp increase at passage 16-18. By measuring in parallel foci of ATM phosphorylated at Ser-1981 and their co-localization with γH2AX foci, along with differentiating cells into proliferating and resting by using a Ki67 marker, we conclude that the sharp increase in γH2AX foci numbers was ATM-independent and happened predominantly in proliferating cells. At the same time, gradual and moderate increase in γH2AX foci with passage number seen in both resting and proliferating cells may represent a slow, DNA double-strand break related component of the accumulation of genetic instability in MSCs. Our results provide important information on selecting appropriate passage numbers exceeding which would be associated with substantial risks to a patient-recipient, both with respect to therapeutic efficiency and side-effects related to potential neoplastic transformations due to genetic instability acquired by MSCs during expansion.
