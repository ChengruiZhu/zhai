Ovarian cancer is the eighth most common cancer and the seventh highest cause of cancer-associated mortality in women worldwide. It is the second highest cause of mortality among female reproductive malignancies. The current standard first-line treatment for advanced ovarian cancer includes a combination of surgical debulking and standard systemic platinum-based chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel. Although a deeper understanding of this disease has been attained, relapse occurs in 70% of patients 18 months subsequent to the first-line treatment. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a novel drug that effectively affects ovarian cancer, particularly tumors that are resistant to current chemotherapy. The aim of the present study was to identify genes whose expression may be used to predict survival time or prognosis in ovarian cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. Gene or protein expression is an important issue in chemoresistance and survival prediction in ovarian cancer. In the present study, the research group consisted of patients treated at the Surgical Clinic of the Gynecology and Obstetrics Gynecological Clinical Hospital, Poznan University of Medical Sciences (Poznan, Poland) between May 2006 and November 2014. Additional eligibility criteria were a similar severity (International Federation of Gynecolgy and Obstetrics stage III) at the time of diagnosis, treatment undertaken in accordance with the same schedule, and an extremely good response to treatment or a lack of response to treatment.
