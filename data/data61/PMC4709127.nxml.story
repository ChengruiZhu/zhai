Accurate genome replication is essential for the transmission of genetic information, and this process is vulnerable to factors that can induce DNA damage or block replication. To avoid this and achieve genome stability, many enzymes need to coordinate their activities at the replication forks (the area where the two DNA strands separate to replicate), thereby ensuring high efficiency and fidelity. Replication occurs simultaneously in both strands, but DNA polymerases only work in one direction (5′-to-3′), and while synthesis of one strand proceeds continuously, synthesis of the other must occur via small DNA fragments that need to be joined together after the removal of their 5′ ends by the flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1). In addition, FEN1 has a gap endonuclease activity that can potentially introduce strand breaks at the sites of replication. Here we report the identification of a new member of this complex of proteins called Wuho (WH) that has a role in guarding the genome stability at the replication forks. Down-regulation of Wuho in tissue culture cells results in double-strand DNA breaks and programmed cell death. Genetic and biochemical results indicate that WH interacts with FEN1 and regulates its activities at the replication fork by promoting its flap endonuclease activity while dampening its gap endonuclease activity. These results suggest a critical role of Wuho in protecting the integrity of replication forks.
