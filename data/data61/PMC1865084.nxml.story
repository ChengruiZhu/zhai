 A key part of the practice of evidence-based medicine (essentially, the appropriate use of current best evidence in determining care of individual patients) involves appraising the quality of individual research papers. This process helps an individual to understand what has been done in a clinical research study, and to decipher the strengths, limitations, and importance of the work. Several tools already exist to help clinicians and researchers to assess the quality of particular types of study, including randomised controlled trials. One of these tools is called CLEAR NPT, which consists of a checklist that helps individuals to evaluate reports of nonpharmacological trials (i.e., trials not evaluating drugs but other types of intervention, such as surgery). The researchers who developed CLEAR NPT also produced an Internet-based computer learning system to help researchers use CLEAR NPT correctly. They wanted to evaluate to what extent this learning system helped people use CLEAR NPT and, therefore, carried out a randomised trial comparing the learning system to no specific training. A total of 78 health researchers were recruited as the “participants” in the trial, and 39 were randomised to each trial arm. Once the participants had received either the Internet training or no specific training, they used CLEAR NPT to evaluate reports of nonpharmacological trials. The primary outcome was the rate of “correct” answers that study participants gave using CLEAR NPT.
