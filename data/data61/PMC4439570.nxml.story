Novel therapies are needed for treating the increasing prevalence of hepatic steatosis in Western populations. In this regard, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors have recently been reported to attenuate the development of hepatic steatosis, but the potential mechanisms remain poorly defined. In the current study, 4-week-old C57Bl/6 mice were fed a high-fat/high-fructose Western diet (WD) or a WD containing the DPP-4 inhibitor, MK0626, for 16 weeks. The DPP-4 inhibitor prevented WD-induced hepatic steatosis and reduced hepatic insulin resistance by enhancing insulin suppression of hepatic glucose output. WD-induced accumulation of hepatic triacylglycerol (TAG) and diacylglycerol (DAG) content was significantly attenuated with DPP-4 inhibitor treatment. In addition, MK0626 significantly reduced mitochondrial incomplete palmitate oxidation and increased indices of pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, TCA cycle flux, and hepatic TAG secretion. Furthermore, DPP-4 inhibition rescued WD-induced decreases in hepatic PGC-1Î± and CPT-1 mRNA expression and hepatic Sirt1 protein content. Moreover, plasma uric acid levels in mice fed the WD were decreased after MK0626 treatment. These studies suggest that DPP-4 inhibition ameliorates hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance by suppressing hepatic TAG and DAG accumulation through enhanced mitochondrial carbohydrate utilization and hepatic TAG secretion/export with a concomitant reduction of uric acid production.
