 for an open field. In the second step, these parameters were used to calculate dose distributions at the treatment distance of 400 cm. MC simulations of dose distributions from single and dual fields at the treatment distance were performed in a water phantom. Dose distribution from the full treatment with six dual fields was simulated in a CT‐based anthropomorphic phantom. MC calculations were compared to the available set of measurements used in clinical practice. For one direct field, MC calculated PDDs agreed within 3%/1 mm with the measurements, and lateral profiles agreed within 3% with the measured data. For the OF, the measured and calculated results were within 2% agreement. The optimal angle of 17° was confirmed for the dual field setup. Dose distribution from the full treatment with six dual fields was simulated in a CT‐based anthropomorphic phantom. The MC‐calculated multiplication factor (B12‐factor), which relates the skin dose for the whole treatment to the dose from one calibration field, for setups with and without degrader was 2.9 and 2.8, respectively. The measured B12‐factor was 2.8 for both setups. The difference between calculated and measured values was within 3.5%. It was found that a degrader provides more homogeneous dose distribution. The measured X‐ray contamination for the full treatment was 0.4%; this is compared to the 0.5% X‐ray contamination obtained with the MC calculation. Feasibility of MC simulation in an anthropomorphic phantom for a full TSEI treatment was proved and is reported for the first time in the literature. The results of our MC calculations were found to be in general agreement with the measurements, providing a promising tool for further studies of dose distribution calculations in TSEI.
