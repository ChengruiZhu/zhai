Pharyngocutaneous fistulae are a common complication after total laryngectomy. Our study evaluates the correlation of postoperative radiographic swallowing studies and clinical symptoms. We also propose a grading system to classify leaks radiographically. The records of 45 patients who underwent total laryngectomy were retrospectively reviewed. All patients had a radiographic swallowing study (RSS) on or around the tenth postoperative day. A grading system was developed to classify radiographic findings (grade 0–5). Twenty-two patients had an abnormal RSS (grade 2–5). Three patients (13.6%) had clinical signs of impending fistula whereas radiography showed moderate leakage (grade 3) in one patient and a pharyngocutaneous fistula (grade 5) in two. The other 19 patients with radiographically demonstrated leakage had no clinical signs of anastomotic complications. After total laryngectomy, radiography may reveal anastomotic complications of varying severity. The grading system used in this study enabled us to objectively classify the radiological abnormalities on swallowing studies. Because most radiographic leakages were clinically silent and not all clinically apparent fistula were radiographically visible in our study, the role of routine postoperative radiographic swallowing studies in the absence of clinical signs or fistula remains unclear.
