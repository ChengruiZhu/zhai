miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs involved in posttranscriptional regulation of protein-coding genes. In the mammalian genome, two distinct gene clusters code for miR-1 and miR-133a. Primary sequences of mature miR-1 or miR-133a are identical and both gene clusters show similar expression in the heart and skeletal muscle. We have generated compound mutant mice of both miR-1/133a gene clusters resulting in early arrest of heart development while single cluster mutants showed normal morphology but reacted differently to pressure overload. Compound mutant cardiomyocytes were characterized by an immature, mixed smooth muscle-heart muscle phenotype, indicating that miR1-/133a are responsible for specification of the cardiomyogenic lineage. Our search for miR1-/133a targets identified myocardin, which was strongly up-regulated in mutant hearts, while several other putative miR-1/133a targets that have been described before were not altered, indicating that miR-1/133a target control strongly depends on the cellular context. Overexpression of myocardin in embryonic hearts recapitulated major aspects of the miR-1/133a mutant phenotype, suggesting that loss of myocardin suppression is the primary reason for incorrect heart muscle specification in the mutants. In addition, we found that myocardin overexpression stimulated expression of miR-1/133a, which argues for a negative feedback loop required for adjustment of myocardin concentrations in the heart.
