Oncoplastic breast surgery has become a popular choice of treatment for breast reconstruction after mastectomy. There are two different techniques in oncoplastic surgery depending on the volume of the excised breast tissue. One is the volume displacement procedure, which combines resection with a variety of different breast-reshaping and breast-reduction techniques; the other is the volume replacement procedure in which the volume of excised breast tissue is replaced with autologous tissue. In this study, current authors performed various volume replacement techniques based on the weight of the excised tumor and its margin of resection. We used a latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap for cases in which the resection mass was greater than 150 g, and for cases in which the resection mass was less than 150 g, we used a regional flap, such as a lateral thoracodorsal flap, a thoracoepigastric flap, or perforator flaps, such as an intercostal artery perforator flap or a thoracodorsal artery perforator flap. In the patients with small to moderate-sized breasts, when a postoperative deformity is expected due to a large-volume tumor resection, the replacement of non-breast tissue is required. Many of whom have small breasts, oncoplastic volume replacement techniques in breast-conserving surgery allow an extensive tumor excision without concern of compromising the cosmetic outcome and can be reliable and useful techniques with satisfactory aesthetic results.
