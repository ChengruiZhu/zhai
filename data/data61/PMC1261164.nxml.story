Most proteins have distinct three-dimensional structures that determine much of their functional capability. Proteins that are related usually have similar structures, owing to their shared genetic heritage and (often) similar function. Hence, one can speak of “families” of proteins that at one time all shared a common ancestor gene, but have diverged over eons of evolution into distinct forms with similar but altered sequences. In some cases, this sequence divergence can occur to the point that the structures of the proteins actually begin to change, forming “superfamilies” of distantly related proteins. Traditionally, events in protein evolution are investigated through the construction of evolutionary trees based on similarity between protein sequences. However, at the superfamily level sequence similarity weakens to the point that building accurate trees becomes much more problematic. This work attempts to address this problem by integrating structural similarity information into the analysis. Because protein structure changes much more slowly than sequence, structural similarity provides powerful signals about the relationships between proteins. When this new form of tree is considered alongside other evolutionary information, the authors are able to provide a supportable history for much of the evolution of the important protein kinase–like superfamily.
