Results: With a median follow-up of 54.5 (1-76.7) months, high-dose subgroup had a significant higher distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) (82.0% vs. 76.5%, p=0.029) and overall survival (OS) (84.1% vs. 74.0%, p=0.028). Cumulative dose of cisplatin were demonstrated an independent prognostic factors for DMFS (HR=0.524, 95% CI 0.340-0.806) and OS (HR=0.577, 95% CI 0.373-0.893) for the entire cohort upon MVA. As for T1-2N2-3, high-dose subgroup had a trend of better DMFS (85.7% vs. 76.3%, p=0.069) and a significant improvement in OS (87.8% vs. 76.3%, p=0.041). Similarly, in the subgroup of T3-4N2-3, higher dose of cisplatin was associated with higher OS (80.3% vs. 52.3%, p=0.032). Cumulative dose of cisplatin was an independent prognostic factor for DMFS (HR=0.483, 95%CI 0.292-0.798) and OS (HR=0.429, 95%CI 0.258-0.715) for patients with T1-4N2-3 disease upon MVA. However, the benefit of higher dose of cisplatin was not observed in the subgroup of T3-4N0-1. For patients receiving CCRT (n=278), those treated with higher dose of cisplatin had a significantly higher DMFS (87.7% vs. 75.4%, p=0.004). The benefit mainly derived from T3-4N2-3 patients treated with CCRT (5y DMFS: 87.9% vs. 58.2%, p=0.034). Cumulative dose of cisplatin was associated with a lower risk of distant metastasis (HR=0.427, 95% CI 0.228-0.801) for patients treated with CCRT upon MVA.
