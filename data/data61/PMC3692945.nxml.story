Syndromic surveillance data are useful during disasters for situational awareness. These data may also provide value for post-disaster analytic work and predictive modeling for future disasters. This study demonstrates utility of syndromic data for collaborative work resulting in better understanding of environmental interactions on human health. We do know that wildfire occurs with some degree of historic regularity and these results may be useful for preparedness planning. We also know the conditions which must be present for medium to high wildland fire impact upon the population. This study further supports the notion that agencies should be able to strategically deploy resources and messaging immediately preceding the fire period with the goal of reducing human health risk factors and encouraging changes in community behaviors before, during and after a fire. Future fire model shows San Diego County will experience approximately two extreme fire seasons each decade by 2040. This project also promoted collaboration between public health and environmental health entities to better understand determinants of health during a disaster. In addition to developing a better understanding of the consequences of climate change on fire-induced respiratory illness, the project funding has provided support for San Diego County to improve their syndromic surveillance capacity and infrastructure.
