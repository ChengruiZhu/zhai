Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) is a subset of papillary thyroid carcinoma, with tumors measuring â‰¤1.0 cm in maximum diameter. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the most common histopathological subtype of the various esophageal malignancies. The present study reports a rare synchronous presentation of PTMC and asymptomatic ESCC manifesting as lateral cervical lymph node enlargement. The patient, a 70-year-old male who presented to the Department of Surgical Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University (Wenzhou, China)with no significant symptoms, was identified to have bilateral thyroid nodules by ultrasonography and enlarged lymph nodes on the left side of the neck by palpation. A diagnosis of PTMC with lateral cervical lymph node metastasis was established and the patient underwent right lobectomy, partial left lobectomy and lymph node biopsy. Pathological analysis of the intraoperative frozen biopsy indicated bilateral PTMC and metastatic lymph node SCC from a different primary location. Furthermore, histological examination of the biopsied lymph nodes revealed bilateral PTMC and poorly-differentiated SCC, which was verified as ESCC by gastroscopy and postoperative histopathological examination. A review of the present literature indicated that no similar case has been reported thus far. The patient succumbed three months after attending Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (Shanghai, China) for additional treatment.
