Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) is highly abundant in the brain. Various biochemical analyses have indicated that GSK3β is localized to different intracellular compartments within brain cells. However, ultrastructural visualization of this kinase in various brain regions and in different brain cell types has not been reported. The goal of the present study was to examine GSK3β distribution and subcellular localization in the brain using immunohistochemistry combined with light and electron microscopy. Initial examination by light microscopy revealed that GSK3β is expressed in brain neurons and their dendrites throughout all the rostrocaudal extent of the adult mouse brain, and abundant GSK3β staining was found in the cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, the cerebellum, and some brainstem nuclei. Examination by transmission electron microscopy revealed highly specific subcellular localization of GSK3β in neurons and astrocytes. At the subcellular level, GSK3β was present in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, free ribosomes, and mitochondria of neurons and astrocytes. In addition GSK3β was also present in dendrites and dendritic spines, with some postsynaptic densities clearly labeled for GSK3β. Phosphorylation at serine-9 of GSK3β (pSer9GSK3β) reduces kinase activity. pSer9GSK3β labeling was present in all brain regions, but the pattern of staining was clearly different, with an abundance of labeling in microglia cells in all regions analyzed and much less neuronal staining in the subcortical regions. At the subcellular level pSer9GSK3β labeling was located in the endoplasmic reticulum, free ribosomes and in some of the nuclei. Overall, in normal brains constitutively active GSK3β is predominantly present in neurons while pSer9GSK3β is more evident in resting microglia cells. This visual assessment of GSK3β localization within the subcellular structures of various brain cells may help in understanding the diverse role of GSK3β signaling in the brain.
