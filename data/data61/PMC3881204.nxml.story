Traditionally, mitochondria have been regarded solely as energy generators for cells; however, accumulating data have demonstrated that these complex organelles play a variety of roles within the cardiomyocyte that extend beyond this classic function. Mitochondrial dynamics involves mitochondrial movements and morphologic alterations by tethering, fusion, and fission, which depend on cellular energy requirements and metabolic status. Many studies have indicated that mitochondrial dynamics may be a fundamental component of the maintenance of normal cellular homeostasis and cardiac function. Mitochondrial dynamics is controlled by the protein machinery responsible for mitochondrial fusion and fission, but cardiomyocytes are densely packed as part of an intricate cytoarchitecture for efficient and imbalanced contraction; thus, mitochondrial dynamics in the adult heart are restricted and occur more slowly than in other organs. Cardiac mitochondrial dynamics is important for cardiac physiology in diseased conditions such as ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. Changes in mitochondrial morphology through modulation of the expression of proteins regulating mitochondrial dynamics demonstrates the beneficial effects on cardiac performance after IR injury. Thus, accurately defining the roles of mitochondrial dynamics in the adult heart can guide the identification and development of novel therapeutic targets for cardioprotection. Further studies should be performed to establish the exact mechanisms of mitochondrial dynamics.
