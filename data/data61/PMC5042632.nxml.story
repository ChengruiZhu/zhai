We present the case of a 25-year-old woman with the initials S.K. in her second pregnancy that came to our antenatal Consulting Centre. The first screening for blood count, blood group, biochemistry and serology showed results within the reference range. The patient came for a second comprehensive biochemical screening at 17 â€“ 18 weeks gestation. The results showed the low genetic risk of congenital anomalies. Fetal morphology of the fetus was normal. S.K. came again for consultation at 22 weeks gestation in connection with the admittance of her first 3-year-old child to the hospital because of pneumonia. Serological tests of the child had shown elevated CMV titer - specific IgM. Then we made new serological tests of the patient and the results have shown that the patient was most likely infected by CMV primarily in the first trimester of pregnancy. After consulting about the risk of transmission of CMV to the fetus, the woman chose monthly ultrasound scans and refused amniocentesis. At 36 weeks gestation, in addition to the microcephaly already established, enlargement of the IV brain ventricle at the expense of underdevelopment of the cerebellum was noticed. Also, 2nd to 3rd stage of placenta maturity and low quantity of amniotic fluid was established. A male fetus of weight 2,890 g and height 50 cm was delivered. The fetus was with skin petechiae and hepatosplenomegaly. Neurological examination showed no abnormalities.
