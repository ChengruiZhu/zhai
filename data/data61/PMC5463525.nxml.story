Recent technological improvements in head and neck field have changed diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for salivary disorders. Diagnosis is now based on colour Doppler ultrasonography (US), magnetic resonance (MR) sialography and cone beam 3D computed tomography (CT), and extra- and intracorporeal lithotripsy, interventional sialendscopy and sialendoscopy-assisted surgery are used as minimally invasive, conservative procedures for functional preservation of the affected gland. We evaluated the results of our long-term experience in the management of paediatric obstructive salivary disorders. The study involved a consecutive series of 66 children (38 females) whose obstructive salivary symptoms caused by juvenile recurrent parotitis (JRP) (n = 32), stones (n = 20), ranula (n = 9) and ductal stenosis (n = 5). 45 patients underwent interventional sialendoscopy for JRP, stones and stenoses, 12 a cycle of extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL), three sialendoscopy-assisted transoral surgery, one drainage, six marsupialisation, and two suturing of a ranula. Three children underwent combined ESWL and interventional sialendoscopy, and seven a secondary procedure. An overall successful result was obtained in 90.9% of cases. None of the patients underwent traditional invasive sialadenectomy notwithstanding persistence of mild obstructive symptoms in six patients. No major complications were observed. Using a diagnostic work-up based on colour Doppler US, MR sialography and cone beam 3D TC, children with obstructive salivary disorders can be effectively treated in a modern minimally-invasive manner by extracorporeal and intracorporeal lithotripsy, interventional sialendoscopy and sialendoscopy-assisted transoral surgery; this approach guarantees a successful result in most patients, thus avoiding the need for invasive sialadenectomy while functionally preserving the gland.
