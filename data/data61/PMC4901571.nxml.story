Six fresh frozen human cadaveric knees were screened with fluoroscopy to ensure the specimens were free of osteoarthritis. MRIs were acquired to generate 3D tibial models and meniscal roots were identified and mapped onto the model. Six 1.0 mm diameter steel beads were injected into the medial and lateral meniscus (Fig. 1) using minimally invasive surgical techniques and a RSA bead injector. Three additional beads each were implanted into the femur and tibia for bone tracking. CT scans were then obtained and used to create 3D femur and tibia models. The specimens were then potted with the quadriceps tendon isolated, for use in a custom-designed knee press. DSX images were collected at 30 frames/s while the specimens underwent dynamic flexion under half body weight from 10 to 40 degrees. The ACL was then transected arthroscopically and testing was repeated. Meniscal translation and deformation were analyzed by combining 3D models with DSX data. A least-squares-fitted ellipse (Fitzgibbon, 1999) was generated based on six meniscal beads and two centroids of the meniscal roots for the medial and lateral meniscus respectively (Fig. 1). The meniscus kinematics was quantified by the translation of the center of the ellipse, and the circumferential deformation was represented by the changes in the elliptical arc length. The arc lengths of four regions were calculated: total (posterior root to anterior root), posterior horn (posterior root to the adjacent bead), anterior horn (anterior root to the adjacent bead), and middle region (first to last beads). The translation and deformation of the meniscus were compared between ACL-intact and ACL-transected states.
