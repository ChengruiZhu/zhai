Myocardial deformation is a sensitive marker of sub-clinical myocardial dysfunction that carries independent prognostic significance across a broad range of cardiovascular diseases. It is now possible to perform 3D feature tracking of SSFP cines on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (FT-CMR). This study provides reference ranges for 3D FT-CMR and assesses its reproducibility compared to 2D FT-CMR. One hundred healthy individuals with 10 men and women in each of 5 age deciles from 20 to 70 years, underwent 2D and 3D FT-CMR of left ventricular myocardial strain and strain rate using SSFP cines. Good health was defined by the absence of hypertension, diabetes, obesity, dyslipidaemia, or any cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, haematological and systemic inflammatory disease. Normal values for myocardial strain assessed by 3D FT-CMR were consistently lower compared with 2D FT-CMR measures [global circumferential strain (GCS) 3D − 17.6 ± 2.6% vs. 2D − 20.9 ± 3.7%, P < 0.005]. Validity of 3D FT-CMR was confirmed against other markers of systolic function. The 3D algorithm improved reproducibility compared to 2D, with GCS having the best inter-observer agreement [intra-class correlation (ICC) 0.88], followed by global radial strain (GRS; ICC 0.79) and global longitudinal strain (GLS, ICC 0.74). On linear regression analyses, increasing age was weakly associated with increased GCS (R
