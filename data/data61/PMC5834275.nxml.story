This study was performed to screen miRNAs and mRNAs that are differentially expressed during trypsinogen activation in acute pancreatitis and to verify their role in the process of trypsinogen activation. The function enrichment analysis showed that the functions of miR-352 and its regulatory targets lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2) and cathepsin L1 (CTSL1) were lysosome related. The results of the verification experiment showed that in the TLC-S-treated AR42J (pancreatic cell line) cells, miR-352 expression increased, expression levels of LAMP2 and CTSL1 were significantly reduced, trypsinogen activation was increased, and the autophagy pathway was blocked. In the miR-352 mimic-transfected cells, miR-352 expression increased, expression levels of LAMP2 and CTSL1 were significantly reduced, trypsinogen activation was increased, intracellular lysosomal pH increased, cathepsins L activity decreased and the amount of autophagolysosomes increased. In the miR-352 inhibitor-transfected cells, miR-352 expression was reduced, expression levels of LAMP2 and CTSL1 were significantly increased, trypsinogen activation was decreased, intracellular lysosomal pH decreased, cathepsins L activity increased and the amount of autophagolysosomes decreased. In the process of taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate (TLC-S) induced trypsinogen activation, overexpression of miR-352 could down-regulate LAMP2 and CTSL1, resulting in the dysfunction of autophagic lysosome. Thus, the autophagy pathway was blocked, and trypsinogen activation was enhanced.
