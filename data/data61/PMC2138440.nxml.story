 106 rabbits received one or more courses of inoculations, spaced 1–4 months apart, with Group A streptococci, usually of strains isolated from patients with acute glomerulonephritis. 8 days to a few weeks after onset of a given infection with streptococci known to have been nephritogenic for man, marked proteinuria, often with hematuria and occasionally with azotemia, was detected in 22 of the animals. 15 of these were sacrificed a few days to a few weeks thereafter, and 10 showed renal changes like those of acute or recurrent acute glomerulonephritis in man. Such changes occurred in three other rabbits whose urine was not examined that died or were sacrificed 1–3 wk after onset of infection with streptococci of a serotype known to include a strain nephritogenic for man. The remaining seven animals in which marked proteinuria had occurred died or were sacrificed many months later, in some cases after additional infections. Two of these had become azotemic and two convulsed and died after giving birth; in these animals, there were renal changes like those that occur in man in chronic latent glomerulonephritis, toxemia of pregnancy super-imposed on chronic latent glomerulonephritis, or chronic active glomerulonephritis. Anatomical changes in the kidneys in the experimentally induced and in naturally occurring glomerulonephritis, from acute to chronic stages, are compared and illustrated. The pathogenesis of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is discussed.
