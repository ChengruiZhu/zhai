 183:2143–2149) showed, using RIP LCMV perforin-deficient mice, that IDDM does not occur in the absence of perforin. They concluded that perforin-mediated killing by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) is the main factor needed for β cell injury and destruction. Here we provide evidence that killing of β cells is more complex and multifactorial. By the use of our RIP LCMV model, we show that in perforin competent but interferon-γ (IFN-γ)–deficient mice, β cell injury is limited and IDDM does not occur. For these studies, double transgenic mice were generated that were genetically deficient in the production of IFN-γ and express LCMV NP or GP in their β cells. In such mice, IDDM was aborted despite the generation of LCMV-specific antiself CTLs that displayed normal cytolytic activity in vitro and in vivo and entered the pancreas. However, mononuclear infiltration into the islets did not occur, and upregulation of class I and II molecules usually found in islets of RIP LCMV single transgenic mice after LCMV infection preceding the onset of clinical IDDM was not present in these bigenic mice. Our findings indicate that in addition to perforin, β cell destruction, development of insulitis, and IDDM also depend on the cytokine INF-γ, presumably through enhancement of major histocompatibility complex expression and antigen presentation.
