The use of non-chemical methods to differentiate stem cells has attracted
researchers from multiple disciplines, including the engineering and the
biomedical fields. No doubt, growth factor based methods are still the most
dominant of achieving some level of proliferation and differentiation control -
however, chemical based methods are still limited by the quality, source, and
amount of the utilized reagents. Well-defined non-chemical methods to
differentiate stem cells allow stem cell scientists to control stem cell biology
by precisely administering the pre-defined parameters, whether they are
structural cues, substrate stiffness, or in the form of current flow. We have
developed a culture system that allows normal stem cell growth and the option of
applying continuous and defined levels of electric current to alter the cell
biology of growing cells. This biphasic current stimulator chip employing ITO
electrodes generates both positive and negative currents in the same culture
chamber without affecting surface chemistry. We found that biphasic electrical
currents (BECs) significantly increased the proliferation of fetal neural stem
cells (NSCs). Furthermore, BECs also promoted the differentiation of fetal NSCs
into neuronal cells, as assessed using immunocytochemistry. Our results clearly
show that BECs promote both the proliferation and neuronal differentiation of
fetal NSCs. It may apply to the development of strategies that employ NSCs in
the treatment of various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's
and Parkinson's diseases.
