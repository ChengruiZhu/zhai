Beidler's work in the 1950s showed that anions can strongly influence gustatory responses to sodium salts. We have demonstrated "anion inhibition" in the hamster by showing that the chorda tympani nerve responds more strongly to NaCl than to Na acetate over a wide range of concentrations. Iontophoretic presentation of Cl- and acetate to the anterior tongue elicited no response in the chorda tympani, suggesting that these anions are not directly stimulatory. Drugs (0.01, 1.0, and 100 microM anthracene-9-carboxylate, diphenylamine-2-carboxylate, 4- acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate, and furosemide) that interfere with movements of Cl- across epithelial cells were ineffective in altering chorda tympani responses to 0.03 M of either NaCl or Na acetate. Anion inhibition related to movements of anions across epithelial membranes therefore seems unlikely. The chorda tympani contains a population of nerve fibers highly selective for Na+ (N fibers) and another population sensitive to Na+ as well as other salts and acids (H fibers). We found that N fibers respond similarly to NaCl and Na acetate, with spiking activity increasing with increasing stimulus concentration (0.01-1.0 M). H fibers, however, respond more strongly to NaCl than to Na acetate. Furthermore, H fibers increase spiking with increases in NaCl concentration, but generally decrease their responses to increasing concentrations of Na acetate. It appears that anion inhibition applies to taste cells innervated by H fibers but not by N fibers. Taste cells innervated by N fibers use an apical Na+ channel, whereas those innervated by H fibers may use a paracellularly mediated, basolateral site of excitation.
