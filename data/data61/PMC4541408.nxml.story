 Focused Microwave Radiometry implemented to carry out measurements of in depth body temperature distributions, may provide the capability of sensing local electrical conductivity fluctuations during the cycle of actions potentials in the case of brain excitable cell clusters. An analog beamformer consisting of a conductive inner-surface ellipsoidal cavity is used to focus the chaotic-black body radiation emerging from human tissues by providing convergence of the electromagnetic energy from one focus area where the phantom or subject is placed, to the other where the antennas of sensitive radiometric receivers are positioned. During the past 10 years numerous phantom, animal and human volunteer experiments have been performed with the focused radiometry imaging system. The results show that the detected changes of the output radiometric voltage are attributed to temperature and/or conductivity changes that occur locally concentrated at the areas of interest under measurement. Theoretical and experimental studies are continuously carried out at various frequency bands in conjunction with the use of matching materials placed around the human head or phantom to improve focusing and detection depth. It seems that the manipulation of the focusing area in the tissue in terms of detection depth and spatial resolution is feasible depending on the suitable combination of operation frequencies and matching material. In this paper, theoretical analysis of ion charge diffusion during the cycle of action potentials, propagating along the axons in case of measurements of specific cortical regions is presented. The ion charge diffusion modeling is based on electromagnetic diffusion analogies in the effort to explain the observed experimental results obtained under various psychophysiological conditions in the case of human volunteer measurements.
