Huntingtonâ€™s disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder caused by abnormal expansion of CAG in the huntingtin gene. In R6/2 HD transgenic mice, human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) can slow disease progression via secretion of multiple paracrine growth factors. In order to prompt autologous ASCs transplantation in HD, we isolated ASCs from subcutaneous adipose tissues from a HD patient and a normal volunteer. ASCs were grown in two different types of stem cell culture media, EGM-2MV (endothelial growth medium-2 MV) or mesenchymal culture medium (MesenPRO). Cell-surface markers CD13, CD29, CD31, CD34, and CD44 were characterized by flow cytometry. BDNF, HGF, IGF, LIF, NGF, and VEGF expressions were determined by RT-PCR. Cell surface markers for HD ASCs were similar to those for normal ASCs. HD ASCs expressed multiple growth factors, and were similar to normal ASCs, except for NGF; however, they can be altered by culture medium. ASCs were transplanted in bilateral striata of 8 month-old YAC128 mice. At 12 months of age, normal ASCs reduced striatal atrophy, while HD ASCs failed to prevent it. Compared to the control YAC128 group, no improvement in Rotarod performance was observed in any of the transplanted YAC128 mice. However, when normal ASCs were transplanted at 12 months, Rotarod performance was maintained for 4 weeks, with detectable transplanted cells in the striatum and periventricular area. In summary, cultured HD patient-derived ASCs express multiple growth factors with the same cell surface markers as those of normal ASCs in vitro. The efficacy of ASCs transplantation in YAC128 transgenic models can be modified, depending on the time window.
