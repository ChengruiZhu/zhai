Buttonhole cannulation has been suggested as a technique that may lead to a reduction in many complications when compared with other techniques such as rope-ladder cannulation. Despite all above, some complications still continue, which may lead to a dysfunction of the arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and inadequate dialysis, having an impact on the quality of life of the patients or eventually making the vascular access unusable. We report a 47-year-old Chinese male with end-stage renal disease who had maintenance hemodialysis three times a week for 5 years. The AVF on the left wrist was operated 5 years ago and proved to be functionally effective with some monitoring and surveillance measures in the fourth year of hemodialysis. Two months later, the buttonhole cannulation technique was applied due to fistula punctuation difficulty by previous aneurysmal dilatation. After 10 times of buttonhole cannulation, the edema on the left forearm of the patient indicated a dysfunction of the AVF. This was further confirmed by the HD02 hemodialysis monitor and a vascular ultrasound, revealing a recirculation of 87%, an abnormal fistula between the AVF and the vein together with thrombus, and aneurysmal dilatation near the anastomosis. The site of cannulation was changed to avoid heavy recirculation (reduced to 25%), and a new AVF on the left wrist was successfully operated. Abnormal fistula on the AVF and vein during buttonhole cannulation is rarely reported, which reminds us that vascular access surveillance should be done regularly before and during the process of construction to find a possible dysfunction of the AVF in patients undergoing buttonhole cannulation.
