The Endeavor Resolute® (ER) is a zotarolimus-eluting stent (ZES) with a biocompatible BioLinx polymer. This study prospectively compared the clinical outcomes of 2 versions of ZES, ER and Endeavor Sprint® (ES), in patients with multivessel disease. A total of 488 patients who underwent multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were divided into 2 groups the ER group (n=288) and the ES group (n=200). The primary endpoint was a composite of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) consisting of death, myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization after 12 months. In all patients, the prevalence of diabetes was higher in the ER group (42.7% vs. 31.0%, p=0.009). The rate of post-PCI Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction flow grade 3 was higher in the ER group (100.0% vs. 98.0%, p=0.028). There were no between-group differences in the in-hospital, 1-month and 12-month clinical outcomes. In the propensity score matched cohort (n=200 in each group), no differences were observed in the baseline and procedural characteristics. There were no statistical differences in the rates of in-hospital, 1-month and 12-month events (12-month MACE in the ER and ES groups: 6.0% vs. 3.5%, p=0.240, respectively). The safety and efficacy of both versions of ZES were comparable in patients with multivessel disease during a 12-month clinical follow-up.
