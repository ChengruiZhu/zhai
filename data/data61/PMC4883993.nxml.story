Mesenchymal epithelial transition factor receptor (Met) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a critical role in promoting cancer cell malignant progression. Met is activated by its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). HGF-dependent Met activation plays an important role in stimulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tumor cells, resulting in increased tumor cell proliferation, survival, motility, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. The HGF/Met axis has thus attracted great interest as a potential target in the development of novel cancer therapies. In an effort to suppress tumor cell malignant progression, efforts have been made to develop agents capable of inhibiting inhibit Met-induced EMT, including specific Met tyrosine kinase inhibitors, HGF antagonists that interfere with HGF binding to Met, and antibodies that prevent Met activation and/or dimerization. Tocotrienols, a subgroup within the vitamin E family of compounds, display potent anticancer activity that results, at least in part, from inhibition of HGF-dependent Met activation and signaling. The present review will provide a brief summary of the increasing importance of the HGF/Met axis as an attractive target for cancer chemotherapy and the role of tocotrienols in suppressing Met activation, signaling and HGF-induced EMT in breast cancer cells. Evidence provided suggests that Î³-tocotrienol therapy may afford significant benefit in the treatment of breast cancers characterized by Met dysregulation.
