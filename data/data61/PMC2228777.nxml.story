Previously we tested the validity of the one-dimensional diffusion equation for O2 in the excised frog sartorius muscle and used it to measure the diffusion coefficient (D) for O2 in this muscle and the time course of its rate of O2 consumption (Qo2) after a tetanus (Mahler, 1978, 1979, J. Gen. Physiol., 71:533-557, 559-580, 73:159- 174). A transverse section of the frog sartorius is in fact well fit by a hemi-ellipse with width divided by maximum thickness averaging 5.1 +/- 0.2. Using the previous techniques with the two-dimensional diffusion equation and this hemi-elliptical boundary yields a value for D that is 30% smaller than reported previously; the revised values at 0, 10, and 22.8 degrees C are 6.2, 7.9, and 10.8 X 10(-6) cm2/s, respectively. After a tetanus at 20 degrees C, Qo2 rose quickly to a peak and then declined exponentially, with a time constant (tau) approximately 15% faster than that reported previously; tau averaged 2.1 min in Rana temporaria and 2.6 min in Rana pipiens. A technique was devised to measure the solubility (alpha) of O2 in intact, respiring muscles, and yielded alpha (muscle)/alpha (H2O) = 1.26 +/- 0.04. With these modifications, the values for O2 consumption obtained with the diffusion method were in agreement with those measured by the direct method of Kushmerick and Paul (1976, J. Physiol. [Lond.]., 254:693- 709). Using results from both methods, at 20 degrees C the ratio of phosphorylcreatine split during a tetanus to O2 consumption during recovery ranged from 5.2 to 6.2 mumol/mumol, and postcontractile ATP hydrolysis was estimated to be 13.6 +/- 4.1 (n = 3) nmol/mumol total creatine.
