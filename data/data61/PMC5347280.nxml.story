 Eighty human maxillary central incisors were selected. After simulation of the open apex model, the teeth were assigned to 4 groups based on the mixing and placement techniques of MTA: group 1, manual mixing and manual placement; group 2, manual mixing and manual placement in association with indirect ultrasonic; group 3, ultrasonic mixing and and manual placement; and group 4, ultrasonic mixing and manual placement in association with indirect ultrasonic. The prepared samples were placed within gypsum sockets in which the periodontal ligament was reconstructed with polyether impression material. In group 1, after mixing, the material was condensed with a hand plugger. In group 2, after mixing, the ultrasonic tip was contacted with the hand plugger for 2 seconds. In groups 3 and 4, mixing was carried out with the ultrasonic tip for 5 seconds and in groups 3 and 4, similar to groups 1 and 2, respectively, the materials were placed as apical plugs, measuring 3 mm in length. A wet cotton pellet was placed at canal orifices and dressed with Cavit. After one week, the cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) technique was used to count the number of voids between the material and root canal walls. The void dimensions were determined using the following scoring system: score 1, absence of voids; score 2, the void size less than half of the dimensions of the evaluated cross-section; score 3, the void size larger than half of the dimensions of the evaluated cross-section. Chi-squared and Fisherâ€™s exact tests were used for statistical analyses. Statistical significance was set at
