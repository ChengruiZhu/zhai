 (EEAC) on lung cancer. Cell proliferation and cell cycle distribution were analyzed using (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (MTT) assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Wound-healing assay, Western blotting, and a murine tumor model were separately used to examine cell migration, protein expression, and tumor repression. Our results showed that EEAC induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase resulting decreased cell viability in A549 cells. Moreover, EEAC up-regulated the growth-suppressing proteins, adenosine 5â€²-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), p21 and p27, but down-regulated the growth-promoting proteins, protein kinase B (Akt), mammalian tarfet of rapamycin (mTOR), extracellular signal-regulating kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), retinoblastoma protein (Rb), cyclin E, and cyclin D1. EEAC also inhibited A549 cell migration and reduced expression of gelatinases. In addition, our data showed that tumor growth was suppressed after treatment with EEAC in a murine allograft tumor model. Some bioactive compounds from EEAC, such as cordycepin and zhankuic acid A, were demonstrated to reduce the protein expressions of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and cyclin D1 in A549 cells. Furthermore, EEAC enhanced chemosensitivity of A549 to paclitaxel by reducing the protein levels of caveolin-1. Our data suggests that EEAC has the potential to be an adjuvant medicine for the treatment of lung cancer.
