 (Boisduval) (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) to four colors and to six different fermented fruit juices were observed in order to determine the cues used by foraging adults. According to the results, adults did not show a behavioral response to red, yellow, purple, or white artificial flowers without food odors, but flowers with the fermented pear juice strongly attracted them, and they showed a behavioral response to fermented juices of the six fruits (pear, apple, banana, watermelon, orange, and persimmon) with no statistically significant preference. The fruit volatiles were collected using dynamic headspace adsorption, and the volatile components were analyzed by auto thermal-desorption gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to assess which volatiles existed in the fruits. Only alcohols, esters, and ketones were common in the volatiles of all six fermenting fruits. The five volatile components found in the six fruits, as well as two others found to be in other fermented foods by previous studies, were selected to test the behavioral and electroantennogram (EAG) responses of naive adults to estimate behavioral preference and antennal perception. In field behavioral tests, alcohols were the most attractive, followed by esters, while α-pinene, butanone, and acetic acid were much less attractive. Relative to other volatile combinations and ethanol alone, the mixture of ethyl acetate and ethanol attracted the most feeding adults. The number of adults attracted was significantly positively correlated with the concentration of both ethanol and ethyl acetate. The EAG responses of naive adults showed that the EAG responses to 3-methyl-1-butanol, isoamyl acetate, ethyl acetate, α-pinene, butanone, and acetic acid were all higher than those to ethanol (100%) at doses of either 5 µl/mL or 50 µl/mL. Sexual differences only existed in 3-methyl-1-butanol and acetic acid at particular concentrations. Sexual differences in response to chemical mixtures were not significant at 50 µl/mL. In addition, the EAG responses in the within-sex trials were not correlated to the dosage (0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, 10, and µl/mL) of either ethanol or ethyl acetate. The results showed that olfactory cues played a crucial role in the foraging of adult
