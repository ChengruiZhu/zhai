Enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose is key for the production of second generation biofuels, which represent a long-standing leading area in the field of sustainable energy. Despite the wealth of knowledge about cellulase structure and function, the elusive mechanism by which these enzymes disintegrate the complex structure of their insoluble substrate, which is the gist of cellulose saccharification, is still unclear. We herein present a time-resolved structural characterization of the action of cellulases on a nano-flat cellulose preparation, which enabled us to overcome previous limitations, using atomic force microscopy (AFM). As a first step in substrate disintegration, elongated fissures emerge which develop into coniform cracks as disintegration continues. Detailed data analysis allowed tracing the surface evolution back to the dynamics of crack morphology. This, in turn, reflects the interplay between surface degradation inside and outside of the crack. We observed how small cracks evolved and initially increased in size. At a certain point, the crack diameter stagnated and then started decreasing again. Stagnation corresponds with a decrease in the total amount of surface which is fissured and thus leads to the conclusion that the surface hydrolysis “around” the cracks is proceeding more rapidly than inside the cracks. The mesoscopic view presented here is in good agreement with various mechanistic proposals from the past and allows a novel insight into the structural dynamics occurring on the cellulosic substrate through cellulase action.
