Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an aggressive malignancy associated with unfavorable prognosis, and it’s difficult to diagnose and no effective treatments are available. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in tumorigenesis and metastasis. Intact lncRNAs from exosomes have sparked much interest as potential biomarker for the non-invasive analysis of disease. Here, via exosome sequencing on lncRNAs, GO analysis, KEGG pathway and co-expression analysis, receiver operating characteristic curve and survival analyses, we found that, compared with control group, lncRNAs of ENST00000588480.1 and ENST00000517758.1 showed significantly increased expressions in CCA group. Moreover, area under the curve (AUC) was increased to 0.709 when combined the two lncRNAs, they had a sensitivity and specificity of 82.9% and 58.9% respectively. Further, the higher levels of the two lncRNAs showed a significantly increasing trend with the advancement of cancer TNM stages, and prognosticated a poor survival. In addition, KEGG pathway analysis showed that the most significant difference term was “p53 signaling pathway” (KEGG ID: hsa04115, p: 0.001). The altered lncRNAs and their target genes were included to reconstruct a co-expression network. These altered lncRNAs were mainly related to cellular processes, environmental information processing and organismal systems, etc. Collectively, our findings provided the potential roles of lncRNAs of ENST00000588480.1 and ENST00000517758.1 in CCA, and implicated these lncRNAs as potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets for CCA.
