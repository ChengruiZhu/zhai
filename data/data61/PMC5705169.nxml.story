Notalgia paresthetica, a neurosensory syndrome that typically occurs on the upper back, has multiple clinical symptoms with variable degrees of expression in each individual afflicted with the condition. The involved site is usually hyperpigmented and is associated with burning, coldness, hypoesthesia, increased pain, pruritus and/or tingling. In the affected area, the number of nerve fibers may be increased and the cutaneous sensory nerves are altered secondary to localized impingement, central injury, or both. Although multiple therapeutic approaches for notalgia paresthetica have been described, none specifically address the essential pathogenesis of the condition—the altered cutaneous nerves. Cryolipolysis is a well-tolerated nonsurgical technique to reduce the subcutaneous fat layer. Selective apoptosis of adipocytes occurs since the lipid-rich fat cells are more susceptible to cold injury than the surrounding water-rich cells. Not only a marked decrease in pain sensitivity but also a sustained reduction in the density of myelinated and unmyelinated cutaneous nerves has been observed in cryolipolysis-treated skin. Therefore, cryolipolysis is a logical approach to the treatment of notalgia paresthetica. One or more cryolipolysis treatments may be necessary for complete or partial resolution of the individual’s notalgia paresthetica-related cutaneous symptoms. In conclusion, evaluation of cryolipolysis as a noninvasive treatment of patients with notalgia paresthetica is warranted.
