The collective movement of animals in a group is an impressive phenomenon whereby large scale spatio-temporal patterns emerge from simple interactions between individuals. Theoretically, much of our understanding of animal group motion comes from models inspired by statistical physics. In these models, animals are treated as moving (self-propelled) particles that interact with each other according to simple rules. Recently, researchers have shown greater interest in using experimental data to verify which rules are actually implemented by a particular animal species. In our study, we present a rigorous selection between alternative models inspired by the literature for a system of glass prawns. We find that the classic theoretical models can accurately capture either the fine-scale behaviour or the large-scale collective patterns of movement of the prawns. However, none are able to reproduce both levels of description at the same time. To resolve this conflict we introduce a new class of models wherein prawns ‘remember’, their previous interactions, integrating their experiences over time when deciding to change behaviour. These outperform the traditional models in predicting when individual prawns will change their direction of motion and restore consistency between the fine-scale rules of interaction and the global behaviour of the group.
