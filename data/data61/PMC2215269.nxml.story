Action potentials (APs) were recorded from the extrajunctional membrane of surface fibers of the fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus (extensor) and the slow-twitch soleus muscles of adult rats. APs of the extensor muscle had a significantly faster rate of rise and fall, as well as a shorter duration, than those of the soleus. In addition, the overshoot of APs and the resting membrane potential was greater for the extensor. Whereas the soleus produced only one AP regardless of the stimulus duration, the number of extensor responses was directly proportional to the stimulus duration. This repetitive activity was greatly reduced by a concentration of tetrodotoxin (TTX) as low as 5 X 10(11) g/ml. Within 8 d after crush of the nerves to these two muscles, all differences in AP properties disappeared and both muscles became partially resistant to TTX. Reinnervation brought about a redifferentiation so that differences in AP were again significant at 22 d after nerve crush. However, the rate of rise of extensor APs did not attain normal values even as late as 60 d after nerve crush. APs were found to be the same for extensor and soleus muscles from 12-d-old rats. At 18 d after birth, rate of rise was equivalent to that of adult muscle for the soleus although 50--60 d were required before this parameter was fully mature for the extensor. Nevertheless, APs of the extensor and soleus were clearly differentiated within 25 d after birth. Differences in fast and slow muscle APs are discussed with regard to differences in ion gradients and sarcolemmal conductance.
