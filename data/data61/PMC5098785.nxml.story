-acting polymerases are cooperative, because they copy neighbouring strands, and do not copy themselves directly. Inaccurate replication creates parasitic strands that act as templates but not ribozymes. It is known that in spatially distributed models with slow strand diffusion, clusters of cooperating polymerases arise that can survive in the presence of parasites provided that the error rate is less than a maximum limit (the error threshold). In the RNA World, we envisage multiple types of ribozymes working together. We would like to understand how a multi-ribozyme system could evolve from a system with a single type of polymerase ribozyme. As a first step in increasing complexity, we consider a two-ribozyme system in which there is one polymerase and one nucleotide synthetase that produces monomers for use by the polymerase. We are particularly interested to find conditions in which the chemical supply of monomers is too low for the polymerase to survive alone, but the additional monomers created by the synthetase allow the two-ribozyme system to survive where the single-ribozyme system could not. There is then a selective force for increasing the complexity of the system. Here we show that spatial clustering is sufficient to allow cooperation and survival of systems of unlinked ribozymes with different functions. Clusters form in which synthetases form fringes around the polymerases. Survival of the two-ribozyme system depends on several factors. The strand diffusion rate must be slow enough for cooperative clusters to emerge. The replication rate of the polymerase must be comparable to that of the synthetase. The diffusion rate of the monomers must be neither too slow nor too fast. The model considers the most difficult case for cooperationâ€“unlinked genes with no compartments. The sensitivity of the two-ribozyme system that we study here suggests that evolution of a spatial system with multiple unlinked ribozymes would become increasingly more difficult as the number of components increased, and suggests that linkage and protocells would need to evolve relatively early in the history of life.
