The prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is 0.19%–0.41% in Chinese population. RA exerts profound influence on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), which imposed huge burdens on patients physically, mentally, and economically. As a developing country, People’s Republic of China faces enormous challenges in management of RA. Conventional-synthesized disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) remain the most selective therapeutic options for RA in People’s Republic of China owing to their affordable price and fair efficacy as well as tolerability. Unfortunately, there are substantial RA patients who are poor responders to csDMARDs, even to subsequently combined therapy with tumor necrosis factor antagonist (anti-TNF). Tocilizumab (TCZ) has been approved as a subsequent-line biological agent in patients with moderate-to-severe RA worldwide including People’s Republic of China. TCZ is the first biological agent approved for the treatment of RA inhibiting interlukin-6 (IL-6) by blocking both membrane-bound and soluble IL-6 receptors. Open-label studies in real-life practice and strictly controlled clinical trials demonstrated its high efficacy and safety profile in treatment of patients with RA who have inadequate responses to csDMARDs and anti-TNF. HRQoL of RA patients was improved in various measurements. TCZ was associated with 1.2 times the risk of adverse events, such as infections, dyslipidemia, and hepatic transaminases elevation, compared with pooled placebo. A relatively long half-life allowing for monthly intravenous administration and a newly developed subcutaneous injection make TCZ more acceptable. However, data are not enough so far comparing TCZ to anti-TNF. Lack of evidence in Chinese patients and high cost of TCZ limit its prescription in People’s Republic of China being a developing country. Further clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance may offer a comprehensive assessment of patient satisfaction and acceptability, which may help us define the optimal role for TCZ in therapeutic strategy.
