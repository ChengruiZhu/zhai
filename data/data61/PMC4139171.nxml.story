The understanding
of gene regulation and the structure and function
of the human genome increased dramatically at the end of the 20th
century. Yet the technologies for manipulating the genome have been
slower to develop. For instance, the field of gene therapy has been
focused on correcting genetic diseases and augmenting tissue repair
for more than 40 years. However, with the exception of a few very
low efficiency approaches, conventional genetic engineering methods
have only been able to add auxiliary genes to cells. This has been
a substantial obstacle to the clinical success of gene therapies and
has also led to severe unintended consequences in several cases. Therefore,
technologies that facilitate the precise modification of cellular
genomes have diverse and significant implications in many facets of
research and are essential for translating the products of the Genomic
Revolution into tangible benefits for medicine and biotechnology.
To address this need, in the 1990s, we embarked on a mission to develop
technologies for engineering proteinâ€“DNA interactions with
the aim of creating custom tools capable of targeting any DNA sequence.
Our goal has been to allow researchers to reach into genomes to specifically
regulate, knock out, or replace any gene. To realize these goals,
we initially focused on understanding and manipulating zinc finger
proteins. In particular, we sought to create a simple and straightforward
method that enables unspecialized laboratories to engineer custom
DNA-modifying proteins using only defined modular components, a web-based
utility, and standard recombinant DNA technology. Two significant
challenges we faced were (i) the development of zinc finger domains
that target sequences not recognized by naturally occurring zinc finger
proteins and (ii) determining how individual zinc finger domains could
be tethered together as polydactyl proteins to recognize unique locations
within complex genomes. We and others have since used this modular
assembly method to engineer artificial proteins and enzymes that activate,
repress, or create defined changes to user-specified genes in human
cells, plants, and other organisms. We have also engineered novel
methods for externally controlling protein activity and delivery,
as well as developed new strategies for the directed evolution of
protein and enzyme function. This Account summarizes our work in these
areas and highlights independent studies that have successfully used
the modular assembly approach to create proteins with novel function.
We also discuss emerging alternative methods for genomic targeting,
including transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) and CRISPR/Cas
systems, and how they complement the synthetic zinc finger protein
technology.
