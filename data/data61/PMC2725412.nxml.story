Most eukaryotic genomes are divided into two functional classes of regulation: the euchromatic and the heterochromatic. Heterochromatic regions, often composed of potentially deleterious transposons and retrotransposons, are typically viewed as “silent” or not transcribed. Paradoxically, evidence from multiple organisms indicates that heterochromatic regions must be transcribed to maintain a heterochromatic character. In plants, specialized RNA polymerase complexes are thought to specifically process repetitive regions of the genome into small RNA molecules that facilitate maintenance of a heterochromatic environment. We investigated the role of this specialized polymerase pathway in maintaining maize genome homeostasis with particular focus on RMR1, a novel protein related to a family of DNA repair proteins, whose function in modifying repetitive regions of the genome is unknown. We find most small RNA generation is dependent on RMR1, which appears to function downstream of the specialized polymerase, RNA polymerase IV. However, we provide evidence that the function of RNA polymerase IV is not disrupted by the absence of small RNA generation. Our results suggest the division of the plant genome into euchromatin and heterochromatin is maintained by template competition between the specialized plant polymerases and canonical RNA polymerase II, and not by the subsequent generation of small RNA molecules.
