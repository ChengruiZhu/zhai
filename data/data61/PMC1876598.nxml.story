 Computerized systems for managing health-care information, such as medical records and prescriptions, have the potential to improve medical care. These improvements could come about as a result of embedding software within a medical record system that alerts clinicians to evidence that is relevant to the care they are providing. For example, such a system might deliver a pop-up reminder that informs a clinician about a potential prescribing error, or that the prescription ordered is not supported by recent evidence. Systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials evaluating the benefits of such systems have shown that computerized feedback and reminder systems can improve clinician behavior. However, much of this evidence comes from academic clinics caring for adults, and there is not very much evidence available on children or from community-based, nonacademic clinical practices. The researchers here wanted to evaluate whether a computerized system providing clinical decision support at the time of electronic prescribing could improve prescribing in pediatric primary care. In order to test this, the researchers carried out a cluster randomized trial. This means that individual health-care providers were randomized to receive evidence-based prompts via the computerized system or not, depending on which arm of the trial they were randomized to, but outcome data for the trial were collected at the level of the individual patient's prescription. Pop-up prompts were provided for eight medical conditions common in pediatric primary care, and alerted the provider to a summary of the evidence that supported or refuted the prescription that the provider was about to make. The primary outcome in the trial was the change in proportion of prescriptions dispensed in accordance with evidence, over the course of the trial. In this trial, health-care providers were randomized, rather than patients. This method (cluster randomization) is probably the most appropriate method to carry out a trial such as this, because it reduces the chance of contamination (i.e., that patients not assigned to the intervention might receive some of its benefits). One limitation is the small number of providers that were recruited into the trial; another is that many of these in fact practiced or had recently practiced in academic medicine rather than community-based, nonacademic clinical practices. This limits the ability to generalize from these findings to a nonacademic setting. Finally, the trial was planned with the intention of evaluating the ability of computerized systems to achieve health-care provider behavior change. Therefore, data were analyzed by lumping together outcomes for many different medical conditions. This means that the computerized prompt system may not necessarily have been that successful in achieving improvements in prescribing for any individual condition.
