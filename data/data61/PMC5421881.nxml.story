Many human cancers have been reported to have enhanced expression of the immune checkpoint molecule programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), which binds to programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) expressed on immune cells. PD-L1/PD-1 plays a role in inhibition of antitumor immunity by inducing T cell apoptosis and tolerance. Thus, it is crucial to elucidate mechanisms of PD-L1 expression on cancer cells. ERO1-α is an oxidase located in the endoplasmic reticulum. It is overexpressed in a variety of tumor types and it plays a role in disulfide bond formation in collaboration with PDI. Here, we investigated the influence of ERO1-α on expression of PD-L1 and immune escape. We demonstrated that ERO1-α augmented the expression of PD-L1 via facilitation of oxidative protein folding within PD-L1. In addition, we showed that overexpression of ERO1-α increased HIF-1α protein expression, resulting in an increase of PD-L1 mRNA as well as protein. In clinical cases, we observed that the expression of ERO1-α in triple negative breast cancer was related to the expression of PD-L1. Moreover, apoptosis of Jurkat leukemia T cells, which express PD-1, induced by tumor PD-L1 was inhibited when ERO1-α was depleted. The results suggest that targeting ERO1-α in tumor cells can be a novel approach for cancer immunotherapy. Therefore, the role of ERO1-α in tumor-mediated immunosuppression should be further explored.
