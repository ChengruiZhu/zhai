Stanniocalin-1 (STC1) is a secreted glycoprotein hormone and involved in various types of human malignancies. Our previous studies revealed that STC1 inhibited cell proliferation and invasion of cervical cancer cells through NF-κB P65 activation, but the mechanism is poorly understood. In our studies, we found overexpression of STC1 promoted cell apoptosis while silencing of STC1 promoted cell growth of cervical cancer. Phospho-protein profiling and Western blotting results showed the expression of NF-κB related phosphorylation sites including NF-κB P65 (Ser536), IκBα, IKKβ, PI3K, and AKT was altered in STC1-overexpressed cervical cancer cells. Moreover, PI3K inhibitor LY294002, AKT-shRNA and IκBα-shRNA could decrease the protein content of phospho-P65 (Ser536), phospho-IκBα, phospho-AKT and phospho-IKKβ while increasing the level of P65 compared to STC1 overexpression groups in cervical cancer cells. Also, PI3K inhibitor LY294002, AKT-shRNA and IκBα-shRNA elevated the percentage of apoptosis and suppressed the G1/S transition in those cells. Additionally, STC1 level was decreased in cervical cancer, especial in stage II and III. The results of immunohistochemistry for the cervical cancer microarray showed that a lower level of STC1, phospho-PI3K and P65 protein expression in tumor tissues than that in normal tissues, and a higher level of phospho-P65 protein expression in tumor tissues, which is consistent with the results of the Western blotting. These data demonstrated that STC1 can promote cell apoptosis via NF-κB phospho-P65 (Ser536) by PI3K/AKT, IκBα and IKK signaling in cervical cancer cells. Our results offer the first mechanism that explains the link between STC1 and cell apoptosis in cervical cancer.
