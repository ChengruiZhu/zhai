Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) are considered as an ideal stem cell source for the treatment of neurological diseases. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic potency of DPSCs and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in focal cerebral ischemia using animal models. Following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), rats were randomized into four groups: the BDNF, DPSCs, DPSCs+BDNF and the controls injected with saline. DPSCs were transplanted and BDNF was injected into the DPSCs+BDNF group via the tail vein. The fate of the transplanted DPSCs in rat brains was evaluated using immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, western blot analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Adhesive removal tests and the modified neurological severity scores were used to estimate the restoration of neurological function. Proliferation of intravenously transplanted DPSCs was observed in the peripheral ischemic regions of the MCAO models. A green fluorescent dye PKH67 was used to label cells. PKH67-labeled DPSCs were co-localized with neuronal cell markers and 4â€²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). DPSC transplantation combined with BDNF induced the expression of neural differentiation markers such as nestin, doublecortin (DCX) and neuronal specific filament (NF-H), suggesting that BDNF enhances the survival of DPSCs and differentiation into neuronal cells. Treatment with DPSCs combined with BDNF promoted the recovery of neurological function more effectively compared with BDNF injection or DPSC transplantation alone. In conclusion, treatment with DPSCs combined with BDNF enhances neurological recovery after stroke suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy against cerebral ischemia.
