Red blood cells are responsible for delivering oxygen to tissues throughout the body. These terminally differentiated cells have developed a fascinating flexibility and resiliency that is critical to navigating the circulatory system. Far from being rigid bodies, red blood cells adopt biconcave disk shapes at equilibrium, parachute-like shapes as they move between large vessels and small capillaries, and more extreme shapes as they traverse the endothelial slits of the spleen. Understanding the remarkable mechanical properties that allow red cells to experience such large deformations while maintaining structural integrity is a fundamental question in physiology that may help advance treatments of genetic disorders such as hereditary spherocytosis and elliptocytosis that affect red cell flexibility and can lead to severe anemia. In this work, we present a model of the red blood cell cytoskeleton based on cryoelectron tomography data. We develop an image processing technique to gather statistics from these data and use these statistics to generate a random entropic network to model the cytoskeleton. We then simulate the behavior of the resulting red blood cells in flow. As we demonstrate through simulations, this method makes it possible to examine the consequences of changes in microstructural properties such as the rate of cytoskeletal remodeling.
