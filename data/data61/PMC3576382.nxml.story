Primary spinal glioblastoma (GBM) is a rare disease, with an aggressive course and a poor prognosis. We report a case of a 19-year-old male with a 4-week history of progressive weakness in both lower limbs, which progressed to paraparesis with a left predominance and difficulty in initiating urination over a week. Spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an intramedullary expansile mass localised between T6 and T11. We performed a laminotomy and laminoplasty between T6 and T11 and the tumour was partially removed. Histopathological study was compatible with GBM. The patient was administered focal spine radiotherapy with chemotherapy with temozolamide. Serial MRI performed after the initial surgery demonstrated enlargement of the enhancing mass from T3 to T12 and subarachnoid metastatic deposits in C2 and C4, the pituitary stalk, inter-peduncular cistern, left superior cerebellar peduncle and hydrocephalus. We review the literature with regard to the disease and treatment options, and report the unique features of this case. Primary spinal GBM is an extremely rare entity with a poor prognosis and a short survival time. An aggressive management of the different complications as they arise and improvement of current modes of treatment and new treatment options are required to improve survival and ensure better quality of life.
