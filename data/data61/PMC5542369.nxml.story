The average age of this previously reported cohort was 28.6 years (range11-60), with 148 males and 52 females. There were 40 Tönnis 0 (average age 29; 28 males & 12 females), 112 Tönnis 1 (average age 30; 88 males & 24 females), 45 Tönnis 2 (average age 27; 30 males & 15 females), and 2 Tönnis 3 (average age 33; 1 male & 1 female). The Tönnis 3 data was too small for statistical analysis, as only 2 patients with severe femoral deformities were included. The average improvement was Tönnis 0 23.1 points (preop 69.0; postop 92.1), Tönnis 1 20.6 points (preop 73.9; postop 94.5), Tönnis 2 16.4 points (preop 71.6; postop 88.0), and Tönnis 3 23.5 points (preop 61.5; postop 85). As would be expected, there was a trend (p=0.055) towards lower scores with increasing Tönnis grade, but this was not statistically significant. There was both statistically (p<0.01) and clinically (>5pts) significant improvement across all Tönnis grades; and there was no statistically significant difference between Tönnis 0 and 1 compared to Tönnis 2 (p=0.078). The percent that returned to sport was: Tönnis 0 95%, Tönnis 1 92%, Tönnis 2 85%, and Tönnis 3 100%. Similar to outcome scores, there was a trend (p=0.098) towards lower rates of return to sport with increasing Tönnis grade, but it was not statistically significant; and there was no statistically significant difference between Tönnis 0 and 1 compared to Tönnis 2. Within each grade, there was no correlation with age, such that increasing age did not reflect lower scores. There was also no correlation with gender.
