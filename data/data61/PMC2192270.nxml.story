Interleukin (IL) 2-deficient mice develop a fatal immunopathology characterized by lymphoadenopathy, splenomegaly, T cell infiltration of the bone marrow, loss of B cells, anemia, and inflammation of the gut. The thymus dependence of these disease symptoms was tested by introducing the IL-2 mutation into athymic mice. With the exception of an increase in CD8+ intrahepatic alpha/beta T cells, IL-2 deficiency had no detectable effect on leukocyte composition or health of athymic mice, indicating a key role for thymus-derived T cells in the initiation of disease and demonstrating that B cell development and survival are independent of IL-2. In adoptive transfer studies, lymph node and spleen cells from euthymic IL-2-deficient mice induced disease in athymic mice with an intact IL-2 gene, suggesting that thymus- independent IL-2-expressing cells are unable to control the development of immune pathology. Both IL-2+ and IL-2-/- bone marrow cells repopulated the thymus and the peripheral T cell compartment of the recombination activator gene 2-deficient recipients, and chimeras that had received IL-2-deficient bone marrow developed immune pathology. Disease development was, however, fully or at least partially prevented when 30% of the bone marrow inoculum was derived from mice able to express IL-2. These results demonstrate that the IL-2 deficiency syndrome depends on the intrathymic differentiation of T cells carrying the IL-2 mutation, and that the abnormal activation of IL-2-deficient lymphocytes can be controlled by thymus-derived but not thymus- independent lymphocytes.
