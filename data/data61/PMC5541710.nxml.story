Aberrant protein fucosylation is associated with cancer malignancy. Fucosyltransferase IV (FUT4) is the key enzyme catalyzing the biosynthesis of α1,3-linkage fucosylated glycans carried by glycoproteins on the cell surface, such as the tumor-associated sugar antigen Lewis Y (LeY). An abnormal increase in the levels of FUT4 and LeY is observed in many cancers and correlated with cell proliferation and metastasis. Some microRNAs (miRNAs) are known to negatively regulate gene expression. FUT4 is an oncogenic glycogene, and thus it is important to identify the specific miRNA targeting FUT4. In current study, we first identified miR-200b as a specific miRNA that inhibited FUT4 expression. We found that miR-200b level was decreased, whereas that of FUT4 was increased in tissues and serum of breast cancer compared with that in the control by real-time PCR, western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The alterations of miR-200b and FUT4 level were recovered after chemotherapy. The results also showed that miR-200b suppressed FUT4 expression and inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, as well as in the xenografted tumor tissues and metastatic lung tissues. miR-200b decreased the α1,3-fucosylation and LeY biosynthesis on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), as well as inactivation of EGFR and downstream phosphoinositide-3 kinase/Akt signaling pathway. In conclusion, the study highlights that FUT4 could apply as a novel target for miR-200b that suppress the proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer cells by reducing α1,3-fucosylation and LeY biosynthesis of glycoproteins. miR-200b and FUT4 are potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets for breast cancer.
