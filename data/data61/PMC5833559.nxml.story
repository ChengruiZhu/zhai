The complement system is a crucial component of immunity, and its activation has critical roles in neuroinflammatory response and cellular damage following closed head injury (CHI). We previously demonstrated that systemically injected induced neural stem cells (iNSCs) could modulate complement activation to ameliorate neuronal apoptosis in mouse CHI models. However, it remains unknown whether iNSC derivatives can regulate complement activation. In the present study, after CHI mouse serum treatment, we found dramatic decreases in the cellular viabilities of differentiated iNSCs. Interestingly, following CHI mouse serum treatment, the death of astrocytes derived from iNSCs which were pre-treated with CHI mouse serum was significantly decreased. Meanwhile, the deposition of C3 (C3d) and C5b-9 in these astrocytes was substantially reduced. Remarkably, we detected increased expression of complement receptor type 1-related protein y (Crry) in these astrocytes. Moreover, these astrocytes could reduce the numbers of apoptotic neurons via Crry expression post-CHI mouse serum treatment. Additionally, intracerebral-transplanted iNSCs, pre-treated with CHI mouse serum, significantly increased the levels of Crry expression in astrocytes to reduce the accumulation of C3d and C9 and the death of neurons in the brains of CHI mice. In summary, iNSCs receiving CHI mouse serum pre-treatment could enhance the expression of Crry in iNSC-derived astrocytes to modulate complement activation and mediate neuroprotection following CHI.
