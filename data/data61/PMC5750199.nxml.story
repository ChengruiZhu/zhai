Metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) is a rare subtype of invasive breast cancer and has poor prognosis. In general, cancers are heterogeneous cellular masses comprised of different cell types and their extracellular matrix (ECM). However, little is known about the composition of the ECM and its constituents in MBC. Decorin is a ubiquitous ECM macromolecule known of its oncosuppressive activity. As such, it provides an intriguing molecule in the development of novel therapeutics for different malignancies such as MBC. In this study, decorin immunoreactivity and the effect of adenoviral decorin cDNA (Ad-DCN) transduction were examined in MBC. Multiple immunohistochemical stainings were used to characterize a massive breast tumour derived from an old woman. Furthermore, three-dimensional (3D) explant cultures derived from the tumour were transduced with Ad-DCN to study the effect of the transduction on the explants. The MBC tumour was shown to be completely negative for decorin immunoreactivity demonstrating that the malignant cells were not able to synthesize decorin. Ad-DCN transduction resulted in a markedly altered cytological phenotype of MBC explants by decreasing the amount of atypical cells and by inhibiting cell proliferation. The results of this study support approaches to develop new, decorin-based adjuvant therapies for MBC.
