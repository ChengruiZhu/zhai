Overweight is believed to be associated with colorectal cancer risk. Adipose tissue is loose connective tissue composed of adipocytes. It is now recognized as a major endocrine organ, secreting humoral factors collectively called adipokines. Aberrant hormonal systems consisting of modulated adipokines and their receptors are thought to play a role in colorectal carcinogenesis and cancer progression in obese conditions. However, it is still unclear whether and how each adipokine relates to colorectal carcinogenesis. Notably, a couple of molecules that were initially proposed to be obesity-related adipokines were disqualified by subsequent studies. The adipokines, adiponectin, and intelectin-1 (also known as omentin-1), whose levels are decreased in obesity, act as tumor suppressor factors in various cancers. Numerous studies have demonstrated a link between the insufficient expression and function of adiponectin and its receptor, T-cadherin, in colorectal carcinogenesis. Moreover, our recent study indicated that loss of TMEM207, which is critical for the proper processing of intelectin-1 in the colon mucosa, leads to insufficient intelectin-1 production, thus participating in colorectal carcinogenesis. Here, we discuss the recent understanding of the role of adipokines in colorectal carcinogenesis and subsequently describe the potent tumor suppressor roles of intelectin-1 and TMEM207 in colorectal cancer.
