Promiscuous proteins are commonly observed in biological systems, such as modular domains that recognize phosphopeptides during signal transduction. The use of phosphopeptides and compounds with phosphate groups as inhibitors to protein–protein interactions have attracted increasing interest for years. By using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we are able to perform detailed analyses of the dihedral space to explore protein fluctuation upon ligand binding to better understand promiscuous molecular recognition. Free energy calculation can further provide insights into the mechanism of binding, including both enthalpic and entropic contributions for molecular recognition, which assist in inhibitor design. Our calculation results show that pre-rigidifying a ligand is not always advantageous, suggesting the challenge in retaining optimized intermolecular interactions in pre-rigidified ligand. Instead, certain flexible ligands with multiple binding conformations can reduce entropic penalty, and therefore improves binding affinity. According to our computations, we can introduce new intermolecular interactions to flexible ligand to strengthen attractions while maintaining small entropic penalty by retaining its plasticity in the bound conformation. The study might cast light on a new general strategy for designing inhibitors targeting promiscuous modular domains and protein–protein interactions.
