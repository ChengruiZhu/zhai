A 50-year-old Caucasian man was referred with sudden-onset metamorphopsia and decreased vision in his right eye over the course of the last 2 months. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/80 and poorer than Jaeger 14 in the right eye, and 20/20 and Jaeger 1 in his left eye. In the right fundus, there was a melanocytic lesion occupying the inferotemporal quadrant of the optic disk, extending to the adjacent choroid inferiorly; optic nerve edema, superotemporal retinal vein dilatation, and subretinal fluid under the macula and nasal half of the posterior pole were observed, and a subretinal choroidal neovascularization complex was observed adjacent to the superotemporal margin of the optic disk, confirmed by fluorescein angiography, surrounded by a dense subretinal hemorrhage. Optical coherence tomography showed retinal edema and detachment of neurosensory retina. The patient was treated with three consecutive doses on a monthly basis of intravitreal 1.25 mg/0.05 mL bevacizumab. Visual acuity recovered rapidly, and at 4 months after treatment, it was 20/20 and Jaeger 1, with complete resolution of macular edema and subretinal fluid and hemorrhage. After 3 years of follow-up, best-corrected visual acuity remained stable, macular area was normal, and there was no evident optic nerve edema, retinal vein caliber and aspect were normal, and there was no significant change of the tumor. Fluorescein angiography only evidenced late staining of choroidal neovascularization scar, and optical coherence tomography showed a normal macular anatomy.
