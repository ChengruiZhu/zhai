There has been tremendous progress in detection of breast cancer in postmenopausal women, resulting in two-thirds of women surviving more than 20 years after treatment. However, breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in premenopausal women. Breast cancer is increasing in younger women due to changes in life-style as well as those at high risk as carriers of mutations in high-penetrance genes. Premenopausal women with breast cancer are more likely to be diagnosed with aggressive tumours and therefore have a lower survival rate. Mammography plays an important role in detecting breast cancer in postmenopausal women, but is considerably less sensitive in younger women. Imaging techniques, such as contrast-enhanced MRI improve sensitivity, but as with all imaging approaches, cannot differentiate between benign and malignant growths. Hence, current well-established detection methods are falling short of providing adequate safety, convenience, sensitivity and specificity for premenopausal women on a global level, necessitating the exploration of new methods. In order to detect and prevent the disease in high risk women as early as possible, methods that require more frequent monitoring need to be developed. The emergence of “omics” strategies over the last 20 years, enabling the characterisation and understanding of breast cancer at the molecular level, are providing the potential for long term, longitudinal monitoring of the disease. Tissue and serum biomarkers for breast cancer stratification, diagnosis and predictive outcome have emerged, but have not successfully translated into clinical screening for early detection of the disease. The use of breast-specific liquid biopsies, such as nipple aspirate fluid (NAF), a natural secretion produced by breast epithelial cells, can be collected non-invasively for biomarker profiling. As we move towards an age of active surveillance, home-based liquid biopsy collection kits are increasingly being applied and these could provide a paradigm shift where NAF biomarker profiling is used for routine breast health monitoring. The current status of established and newly emerging imaging techniques for early detection of breast cancer and the potential for alternative biomarker screening of liquid biopsies, particularly those applied to high-risk, premenopausal women, will be reviewed.
