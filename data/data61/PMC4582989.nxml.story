Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is highly incident in southern China, where 40% of world's new cases arise each year. Detection of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) DNA load in nasopharyngeal (NP) brush/swab samples has gradually been established as a method for diagnosis of NPC. However, its applicable value in NPC diagnosis has never been investigated in southern China. It is important to explore whether such a test could be applicable to our local population. A total of 245 consecutive participants undergoing NP brushing examination were recruited to obtain the NP brushing samples in this study. Quantitative PCR assays were used to obtain the EBV DNA load. Mann–Whitney, ANOVA and receiver operating characteristic tests were used to analyze its diagnostic value. NP brushing samples from NPC patients showed extremely high levels of EBV DNA load (mean = 46360 copy/ng DNA) compared to its expression from non-NPC control (mean = 28 copy/ng DNA) and high-risk control (mean = 50 copy/ng DNA) groups. It produced 96% sensitivity and 97% specificity, at the COV = 225 copy/ng DNA. Furthermore, EBV DNA load could reflect disease progress. Our data showed a better performance of EBV DNA load in NP brushing samples compared with an initial biopsy, immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody titers to viral capsid antigen in serum and EBV DNA load in plasma. Detection of EBV DNA load in NP brushing samples could be an effective supplement for NPC diagnosis. Being minimally invasive and low cost, NP brush sampling combined with EBV DNA detection demonstrates great potential for screening high-risk populations for NPC.
