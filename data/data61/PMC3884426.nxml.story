 ions. The methyl groups of the bridging propionate anions are disordered over two positions. The methyl group disorder also induces disorder in the H atoms of the adjacent methyl­ene C atom to the same degree. For one of the propionate anions, the occupancy ratio refines to 0.752 (8):0.248 (8) and for the second, the occupancy ratio refines to 0.604 (6):0.396 (6). In addition, the disorder of the methyl group of the latter propionate anion is correlated with a partially occupied [0.604 (6)] methanol mol­ecule. Furthermore, a methanol mol­ecule and a DMF mol­ecule are positionally disordered in the lattice. The occupancy refines to 0.757 (7):0.243 (7) in favor of the methanol mol­ecule. Correlated to the occupancy of the methanol and DMF mol­ecules is a disordered benzene ring of one salicyl­hydroximate ligand. The benzene ring is disordered over two positions with an occupancy ratio of 0.757 (7):0.243 (7). Lastly, the two lattice methanol mol­ecules are hydrogen bonded to the 15-MC-5 mol­ecule. For the partially occupied methanol mol­ecule associated with the disordered propionate anion, the hydroxyl group of the methanol is hydrogen bonded to a carboxyl­ate O atom of the propionate anion. For the partially occupied methanol mol­ecule associated with the partially occupied lattice DMF mol­ecule, the hydroxyl group of the methanol is hydrogen bonded to the phenolate O atom of a salicyl­hydroximate ligand and to the carbonyl O atom of a coordinated DMF mol­ecule.
