Autonomous release of hematopoietic growth factors may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of certain hematological malignancies. Because of its cytokine synthesis-inhibiting action, interleukin 10 (IL-10) could be a potentially useful molecule to affect leukemic cell growth in such disorders. Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) cells spontaneously form myeloid colonies (colony-forming units- granulocyte/macrophage) in methylcellulose, suggesting an autocrine growth factor-mediated mechanism. We studied the effect of recombinant human IL-10 (rhIL-10) on the in vitro growth of mononuclear cells obtained from peripheral blood or bone marrow of patients with CMML. IL- 10 specifically binding to leukemic cells had a profound and dose- dependent inhibitory effect on autonomous in vitro growth of CMML cells. IL-10 significantly inhibited the spontaneous growth of myeloid colonies in methylcellulose in 10/11 patients, and autonomous CMML cell growth in suspension in 5/5 patients tested. Spontaneous colony growth from CMML cells was also markedly reduced by addition of antigranulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) antibodies, but not by addition of antibodies against G-CSF, IL-3, or IL-6, IL-10-induced suppression of CMML cell growth was reversed by the addition of exogenous GM-CSF and correlated with a substantial decrease in GM-CSF production by leukemic cells, both at the mRNA and protein levels. Our data indicate that IL-10 profoundly inhibits the autonomous growth of CMML cells in vitro most likely through suppression of endogenous GM-CSF release. This observation suggests therapeutic evaluation of rhIL-10 in patients with CMML.
