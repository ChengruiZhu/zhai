The term ‘complex system’ emphasizes that the necessary competence to perform a task is not owned by any one part, but comes as a result of co-operation within the system. ‘Adaptive’ means that system change occurs through successive adaptations. A CAS consists of several subsystems called agents, which act in dependence of one another. They are interdependent. They may either compete or co-operate according to their sense of their interests and what will bring them an advantage. Complex Adaptive Systems are distinguished by self-organisation. Self-organisation is about creating order or increasing the regularity of the system without help from the outside. Good examples would be the ant-hill, the human immune defence, the financial market and the surgical operating theatre team. When we study a CAS, the focus is on the interaction and communication between agents. Contrary to the old cliché, that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts, the whole is the relations between the parts. Order, innovation and progress arise naturally from interactions within a CAS. They do not need to be prescribed from ‘higher’ levels or from the environment. It has been found that for purposes of fostering connectivity among diverse agents, effective coupling of structures, ideas and innovations, and ensuring that they are neither too loose nor too tightly interdependent, complex systems are better led by indirect than by direct leadership behaviours.
