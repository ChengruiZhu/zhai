The stoichiometry and voltage dependence of the Na/K pump were studied in internally dialyzed, voltage-clamped squid giant axons by simultaneously measuring, at various membrane potentials, the changes in Na efflux (delta phi Na) and holding current (delta I) induced by dihydrodigitoxigenin (H2DTG). H2DTG stops the Na/K pump without directly affecting other current pathways: (a) it causes no delta I when the pump lacks Na, K, Mg, or ATP, and (b) ouabain causes no delta I or delta phi Na in the presence of saturating H2DTG. External K (Ko) activates Na efflux with Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Km = 0.45 +/- 0.06 mM [SEM]) in Na-free seawater (SW), but with sigmoid kinetics in approximately 400 mM Na SW (Hill coefficient = 1.53 +/- 0.08, K1/2 = 3.92 +/- 0.29 mM). H2DTG inhibits less strongly (Ki = 6.1 +/- 0.3 microM) in 1 or 10 mM K Na-free SW than in 10 mM K, 390 mM Na SW (1.8 +/- 0.2 microM). Dialysis with 5 mM each ATP, phosphoenolpyruvate, and phosphoarginine reduced Na/Na exchange to at most 2% of the H2DTG- sensitive Na efflux. H2DTG sensitive but nonpump current caused by periaxonal K accumulation upon stopping the pump, was minimized by the K channel blockers 3,4-diaminopyridine (1 mM), tetraethylammonium (approximately 200 mM), and phenylpropyltriethylammonium (20-25 mM) whose adequacy was tested by varying [K]o (0-10 mM) with H2DTG present. Two ancillary clamp circuits suppressed stray current from the axon ends. Current and flux measured from the center pool derive from the same membrane area since, over the voltage range -60 to +20 mV, tetrodotoxin-sensitive current and Na efflux into Na-free SW, under K- free conditions, were equal. The stoichiometry and voltage dependence of pump Na/K exchange were examined at near-saturating [ATP], [K]o and [Na]i in both Na-free and 390 mM Na SW. The H2DTG-sensitive F delta phi Na/delta I ratio (F is Faraday's constant) of paired measurements corrected for membrane area match, was 2.86 +/- 0.09 (n = 8) at 0 mV and 3.05 +/- 0.13 (n = 6) at -60 to -90 mV in Na-free SW, and 2.72 +/- 0.09 (n = 7) at 0 mV and 2.91 +/- 0.21 (n = 4) at -60 mV in 390 mM Na SW. Its overall mean value was 2.87 +/- 0.07 (n = 25), which was not significantly different from the 3.0 expected of a 3 Na/2 K pump.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
