The apical surface of mammalian urinary epithelium is covered by numerous scallop-shaped membrane plaques. This plaque consists of four different uroplakins (UPs) and integral membrane proteins. UPs, which are a member of the tetraspanin superfamily, are assembled into plaques that act as an exceptional barrier to water and toxic materials in urine. Within the plaques, the four UPs are organized into two heterodimers consisting of UP Ia/UP II and UP Ib/UP III in the endoplasmic reticulum. The two heterodimers bind to a heterotetramer, and then assemble into 16-nm particles in the Golgi apparatus. The aggregated UP complex ultimately covers almost all the mature fusiform vesicles in cytoplasm. These organelles migrate towards the apical urothelial cells, where they can fuse with the apical plasma membrane. As a result, the UPs are synthesized in large quantities only by terminally differentiated urothelial cells. For this reason, the UPs can be regarded as a major urothelial differentiation marker. In UP knockout (KO) mice, the incorporation of fully assembled UP plaques in cytoplasm into the apical surface is not functional. The mice with UP III-deficient urothelium show a significantly reduced number of UPs, whereas those with UP II-deficient urothelium have nearly undetectable levels of UPs. This finding strongly suggests that UP II ablation completely abolishes plaque formation. In addition, UP II KO mice contain abnormal epithelial polyps or complete epithelial occlusion in their ureters. UP IIIa KO mice are also associated with impairment of the urothelial permeability barrier and development of vesicoureteral reflux as well as a decrease in urothelial plaque size. In this review, I summarize recently published studies about UPs and attempt to explain the clinical significance of our laboratory results.
