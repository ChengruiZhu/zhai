Assessment of needs of patients with schizophrenia permits practitioners to prioritize, formulate and implement rehabilitation goals. Negative symptoms have been shown to present greater obstacles to effective rehabilitation. The study compared the rehabilitation needs of in and out-patients with schizophrenia, and its relationship with negative symptoms. Thirty each of out patients and short term in-patients who fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia were recruited for the study. Patients currently exhibiting severe unmanageable psychoses and depression were excluded. Tools used for the study were DSM-IV-TR, Rehabilitation Needs Assessment Schedule, SANS, HDRS, BPRS, and UKU. Significant difference across the groups were observed as far as needs regarding requirement of help from a voluntary agency, employment, accommodation, leisure activities and help for family was concerned. Moreover, negative symptoms significantly correlated with rehabilitation needs among both groups of patients. The study also elicited familyâ€²s expectations of their patients regarding their rehabilitation needs. Further, the implications of the association between some negative symptoms and the felt needs of the patients in their rehabilitation were discussed. A full spectrum of functional behaviours needs to be assessed soon after patients recover from their most recent exacerbation and suitable interventions need to be planned.
