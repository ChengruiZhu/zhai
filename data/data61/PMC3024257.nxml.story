A fundamental question in current biomedical research is to establish a link between genomic variation and phenotypic differences, which encompasses both the seemingly neutral diversity, as well as the pathological variation that causes or predisposes to disease. Once the primary genetic cause(s) of a disease or phenotype has been identified, we need to understand the biochemical consequences of such variants that eventually lead to increased disease risk. Such phenotypic effects of genetic differences are supposedly brought about by changes in expression levels, either of the genes affected by the genetic change or indirectly through position effects. Thus, transcriptome analyses seem appropriate proxies to study the consequences of structural variation, such as the 7q11.23 deletion present in individuals with Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS). Here, we present an approach that takes experimental data into account instead of relying solely on functional annotation, following the rationale that coherently regulated genes are likely to play a role in the same biological process. While our algorithm can be applied to expression data from any source, our study provides a resource for the identification of additional candidate genes and pathways to explain the WBS phenotype, as well as a basis for uncovering novel functional interactions between sets of genes.
