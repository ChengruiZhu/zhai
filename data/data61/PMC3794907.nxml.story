Comparative transcriptomic studies routinely identify thousands of genes differentially expressed between species. The central question in the field is whether and how such regulatory changes have been the product of natural selection. Can the signal of evolutionarily relevant expression divergence be detected amid the noise of changes resulting from genetic drift? Our work develops a theory of gene expression variation among a suite of genes that function together. We derive a formalism that relates empirical observations of expression of pathway genes in divergent species to the underlying strength of natural selection on expression output. We show that fitting this type of model to simulated data accurately recapitulates the parameters used to generate the simulation. We then make experimental measurements of gene expression in a panel of single-celled eukaryotic yeast species. To these data we apply our inference method, and identify pathways with striking evidence for accelerated or constrained regulatory evolution, in particular species and across the phylogeny. Our method provides a key advance over previous approaches in that it maximizes the power of rigorous molecular-evolution analysis of regulatory variation even when data are relatively sparse. As such, the theory and tools we have developed will likely find broad application in the field of comparative genomics.
