When a person is infected with HIV, the initial peak level of virus in the blood is usually very high before a lower, relatively stable level is reached and maintained for the duration of the chronic infection. This stable level is known as the set-point viral load (SPVL) and is associated with severity of infection. SPVL is also highly variable among patients, ranging from 100 to a million copies of the virus per mL of blood. The replicative capacity of the infecting virus and the strength of the immune response both influence SPVL. However, standard mathematical models show that variation in these two factors cannot easily reproduce the observed distribution of SPVL among patients. Standard models typically treat infected individuals as well-mixed systems, but in reality viral replication is localised in T-cell centres, or patches, found in secondary lymphoid tissue. To account for this population structure, we developed a carefully parameterised metapopulation model. We find the system can reach a steady state at which the viral load in the blood is relatively stable, representing SPVL, but surprisingly, the patches are highly dynamic, characterised by bursts of infection followed by elimination of virus due to localised host immune responses. Significantly, this model can reproduce the wide distribution of SPVLs found among infected individuals for realistic distributions of viral replicative capacity and strength of immune response. Our model can also be used in the future to understand other aspects of chronic HIV infection.
