The electrical properties of “inward” rectifying egg cell membranes of the starfish mediastera aequalis have been studied in the presence of K(+)-Tl(+) mixtures. When the ratio of the external concentrations of these ions is changed while their sum is kept constant, both the conductance and the zero-current membrane potential go through a minimum, showing clear discrepancies from theoretical results based on conventional electrodiffusion models (E.g., Goldman’s equation). By contrast, when the ration of the two concentrations is fixed and their sum varied, the potential follows an ideal Nernst slope, consistent with Goldman’s equation. The membrane conductance which, according to previous studies on similar membranes, is to be viewed as a function of the displacement of the membrane potential from its resting value δV, shows marked differences between the cases in which K(+) or Tl(+) are the predominant ions: when K(+) is the predominant permeant ion in solution, the addition of small amounts of Tl(+) inhibits the current, while corresponding blocking effects of K(+) on the current are not observed when Tl(+) is the predominant permeant ion. Also, the time course of the conductance during voltage clamp is different in the two cases, being much faster in Tl(+) than in K(+) solution for comparable values of δV. Most of the above features are accounted for by a model in which it is assumed that the ionic channels have external binding sites for cations and that their permeability properties depend on the species of the cation bound (K(+)or Tl(+) in the present experiments).
