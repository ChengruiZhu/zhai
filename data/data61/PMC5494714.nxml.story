Galectin-3 has been reported to be associated with the prognosis of patients with various malignancies; however, it has not yet been investigated in patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (EHCC). Expression of galectin-3 was retrospectively examined in 58 patients with EHCC: 21 with perihilar cholangiocarcinoma and 37 with distal cholangiocarcinoma (DCC). The Cox proportional hazard model was used to identify independent prognostic factors. Intranuclear accumulation of galectin-3 (gal-3-INA) was associated with poorer overall survival (OS) in all patients (P=0.003), as well as in patients with DCC (P=0.004). Patients with gal-3-INA also exhibited a poorer disease-free survival (DFS) than those without gal-3-INA in all patients with EHCC (P<0.001), and in patients with DCC (P<0.001). Gal-3-INA was an independent prognostic factor of OS and DFS in all patients [OS: Hazard ratio (HR), 4.470; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.759–11.357; P=0.002; and DFS: HR, 5.116; 95% CI, 2.025–12.925; P=0.001]. Gal-3-INA was also an independent prognostic factor in patients with DCC (OS: HR, 2.979; 95% CI, 1.035–8.570; P=0.043; and DFS: HR, 6.773; 95% CI, 1.558–29.439; P=0.011). In the analysis of patients with DCC, the number of patients with high galectin-3 expression (P=0.038), recurrence (P<0.001), distant metastases (P<0.001), R0 status (P=0.029) or microscopic vascular invasion (P=0.019) was significantly higher in the gal-3-INA-positive group than in the gal-3-INA-negative group. In conclusion, gal-3-INA was identified as a strong prognostic factor for OS and DFS in patients with DCC.
