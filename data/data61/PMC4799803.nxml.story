MicroRNAs have been identified as key players in the development and progression of osteosarcoma, which is the most common primary malignancy of bone. Sequencing-based miR-omic and quantitative real-time PCR analyses suggested that the expression of miR-193a-3p and miR-193a-5p was decreased by DNA methylation at their promoter region in a highly metastatic osteosarcoma cell line (MG63.2) relative to their expression in the less metastatic MG63 cell line. Further wound-healing and invasion assays demonstrated that both miR-193a-3p and miR-193a-5p suppressed osteosarcoma cell migration and invasion. Moreover, introducing miR-193a-3p and miR-193a-5p mimics into MG63.2 cells or antagomiRs into MG63 cells confirmed their critical roles in osteosarcoma metastasis. Additionally, bioinformatics prediction along with biochemical assay results clearly suggested that the secretory small GTPase Rab27B and serine racemase (SRR) were direct targets of miR-193a-3p and miR-193a-5p, respectively. These two targets are indeed involved in the miR-193a-3p- and miR-193a-5p-induced suppression of osteosarcoma cell migration and invasion. MiR-193a-3p and miR-193a-5p play important roles in osteosarcoma metastasis through down-regulation of the Rab27B and SRR genes and therefore may serve as useful biomarkers for the diagnosis of osteosarcoma and as potential candidates for the treatment of metastatic osteosarcoma.
