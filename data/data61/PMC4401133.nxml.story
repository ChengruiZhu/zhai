Vascular smooth muscle cell contraction depends on intracellular calcium. However, calcium-contraction coupling involves a complex array of intracellular processes. Quantitating the dynamical relation between calcium perturbations and resulting changes in tone may help identifying these processes. We hypothesized that in small arteries accurate quantitation can be achieved during rhythmic vasomotion, and questioned whether these dynamics depend on intracellular signalling or physical vasoconstriction. We studied calcium-constriction dynamics in cannulated and pressurized rat mesenteric small arteries (∼300 μm in diameter). Combined application of tetra-ethyl ammonium (TEA) and BayK8644 induced rhythmicity, consisting of regular and irregular calcium spiking and superposition of spikes. Calcium spikes induced delayed vasomotion cycles. Their dynamic relation could be fitted by a linear second-order model. The dirac impulse response of this model had an amplitude that was strongly reduced with increasing perfusion pressure between 17 and 98 mmHg, while time to peak and relaxation time were the largest at an intermediate pressure (57 mmHg: respectively 0.9 and 2.3 sec). To address to what extent these dynamics reside in intracellular signalling or vasoconstriction, we applied rhythmic increases in pressure counteracting the vasoconstriction. This revealed that calcium-activation coupling became faster when vasoconstriction was counteracted. During such compensation, a calcium impulse response remained that lasted 0.5 sec to peak activation, followed by a 1.0 sec relaxation time, attributable to signalling dynamics. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the feasibility of quantitating calcium-activation dynamics in vasomoting small arteries. These dynamics relate to both intracellular sig-nalling and actual vasoconstriction. Performing such analyses during pharmacological intervention and in genetic models provides a tool for unravelling calcium-contraction coupling in small arteries.
