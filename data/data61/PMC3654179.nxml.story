We measured the calibers of the left and right internal jugular veins (IJV) and sizes of the left and right transverse sinuses (TS) in 91 cadavers, compared them between the left and right sides, and also evaluated the drainage patterns of the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and straight sinus (=rectal sinus, RS) in the torcular Herophili. In addition, the running type of groove for the SSS was investigated. The results were as follows: (1) The right IJV was larger in 81.3 %, while the left IJV was larger in only 11.0 %. (2) The drainage pattern of the SSS was the right type in 73.6 %, intermediate type in 14.3 %, and left type in 12.1 %. (3) The drainage pattern of the RS was the right type in 27.5 %, intermediate type in 25.3 %, and left type in 47.3 %. (4) The running type of groove for the SSS was mostly consistent with the drainage pattern of this sinus. (5) Concerning the relationships among these findings including the size of the TS, the drainage pattern of the SSS was mostly consistent with the side showing a larger TS as well as the side showing a larger IJV. These results suggest that the pattern of drainage of the SSS into the left and right TS affects the size of the TS and the running type of groove for the SSS, and is also closely involved in the caliber of the IJV. A discussion of the embryological, genetic, and clinical implications of these results is presented.
