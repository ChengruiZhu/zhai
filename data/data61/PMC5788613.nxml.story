The proteome profile changes after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and the roles played by important protein species remain poorly understood. Here, we constructed a mouse AMI model by ligating the left coronary artery of male C57B/6J mice to investigate the molecular changes after AMI on the protein level. Total proteins of the left ventricle were extracted and quantitatively analyzed by isobaric tags using relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) technologies. The transcript and protein levels of important genes were further validated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot. An oxygen and glucose deprivation/reperfusion cell model was constructed using H9C2 cells to further validate the expression patterns and functions of important proteins after hypoxia. Seven hundred seventy-six proteins were identified as differentially abundant proteins after AMI, of which 406 were accumulated, and 370 were reduced. Gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that the most enriched molecular function category terms were binding, including calcium ion biding, GTP binding, actin binding and lipid binding. The expression levels of vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) and its related proteins were increased in both left ventricular tissue and H9C2 cells after ischemia-hypoxia. Overexpression of VDBP in H9C2 cells reduced vitamin D receptor and promoted the cell apoptosis rate after hypoxia. Our data provided new insights into proteome profile changes after AMI and indicated that VDBP could promote cardiomyocyte apoptosis after hypoxia.
