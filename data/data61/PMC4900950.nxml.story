Retinal dystrophies are a major cause of blindness for which there are currently no curative treatments. Transplantation of stem cell‐derived neuronal progenitors to replace lost cells has been widely investigated as a therapeutic option. Another promising strategy would be to trigger self‐repair mechanisms in patients, through the recruitment of endogenous cells with stemness properties. Accumulating evidence in the past 15 year0s has revealed that several retinal cell types possess neurogenic potential, thus opening new avenues for regenerative medicine. Among them, Müller glial cells have been shown to be able to undergo a reprogramming process to re‐acquire a stem/progenitor state, allowing them to proliferate and generate new neurons for repair following retinal damages. Although Müller cell–dependent spontaneous regeneration is remarkable in some species such as the fish, it is extremely limited and ineffective in mammals. Understanding the cellular events and molecular mechanisms underlying Müller cell activities in species endowed with regenerative capacities could provide knowledge to unlock the restricted potential of their mammalian counterparts. In this context, the present review provides an overview of Müller cell responses to injury across vertebrate model systems and summarizes recent advances in this rapidly evolving field.
