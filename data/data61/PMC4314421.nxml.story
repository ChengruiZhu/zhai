Stem cell therapy has attracted widespread attention for a number of diseases. Recently, neural stem cells (NSCs) from the cochlear nuclei have been identified, indicating a potential direction for the treatment of sensorineural hearing loss. Acoustic stimuli play an important role in the development of the auditory system. In this study, we aimed to determine whether acoustic stimuli induce NSC development and differentiation through the upregulation of clusterin (CLU) in NSCs isolated from the cochlear nuclei. To further clarify the underlying mechanisms involved in the development and differentiation of NSCs exposed to acoustic stimuli, we successfully constructed animal models in which was CLU silenced by an intraperitoneal injection of shRNA targeting CLI. As expected, the NSCs from rats treated with LV-CLU shRNA exhibited a lower proliferation ratio when exposed to an augmented acoustic environment (AAE). Furthermore, the inhibition of cell apoptosis induced by exposure to AAE was abrogated after silencing the expression of the CLU gene. During the differentiation of acoustic stimuli-exposed stem cells into neurons, the number of astrocytes was significantly reduced, as evidenced by the expression of the cell markers, microtubule associated protein-2 (MAP-2) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which was markedly inhibited when the CLU gene was silenced. Our results indicate that acoustic stimuli may induce the development and differentiation of NSCs from the cochlear nucleus mainly through the CLU pathway. Our study suggests that CLU may be a novel target for the treatment of sensorineural hearing loss.
