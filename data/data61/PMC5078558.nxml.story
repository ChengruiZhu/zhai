-glucan (BDG) were detected by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationâ€“time of flight (MALDI-TOF) MS, Platelia, and Fungitell assays, respectively. For IC, the sensitivity and specificity of the MS-DS index, BDG detection, and Mnn detection were 62% and 84%, 82% and 60%, and 33% and 94% per serum sample and 83% and 69%, 96% and 31%, and 39% and 86% per patient, respectively. For IA, the corresponding values in comparison to BDG and GM detection were 83% and 81%, 62% and 95%, and 62% and 100% per serum sample and 93% and 76%, 87% and 90%, and 93% and 100% per patient, respectively. Nine of the 10 MM patients had a positive MS-DS result. MS-DS gave an early diagnosis in IC (73% positivity before blood culture), IA (positive before GM detection in six patients), and MM (positivity mainly preceded the date of diagnosis) patients. For IC, persisting MS-DS was associated with a poor prognosis. The different biomarkers were rarely detected simultaneously, suggesting different kinetics of release and clearance. For IA, MS-DS provided better complementation to GM monitoring than BDG monitoring. MS-DS detects panfungal molecules circulating during invasive fungal infections. The performance of MS-DS compared favorably with those of biological tests currently recommended for monitoring at-risk patients. Further validation of this test in multicenter studies is required.
