Ovarian cancer is a lethal gynecological cancer causing cancer-related deaths in women worldwide. It is difficult to diagnosis at an early stage when more than 90% patients can be cured because of lack of specific symptoms and early detection markers. Most of malignant ovarian tumors are originated from the germinal epithelium of the ovary. For investigation with animal models of epithelial-derived ovarian cancer (EOC), laying hens are the most relevant animal models because they spontaneously develop EOC as occurs in women through ovulating almost every day. As in women, EOC in the hen is age-related and grossly and histologically similar to that in women. However, domesticated animals are inappropriate for research human EOC due to multiple pregnancies and lactating or seasonally anestrous. In addition, the non-spontaneous nature of rodents EOC limits clinical relevance with human EOC. Recent studies have shown that ovarian cancer could arise from epithelium from the oviduct as oviduct-related genes are up-regulated in EOC of hens. Therefore, we showed in the review: 1) characterization and classification of EOC; 2) chicken models for EOC; 3) relationship estrogen with EOC; 4) candidate prognostic factors for EOC including serpin peptidase inhibior, clade B (ovalbumin), member 3 (SERPINB3), SERPINB11, gallicin 11 (GAL11), secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) and alpha 2 macroglobulin (A2M) in normal and cancerous ovaries of laying hens; 5) biological roles of microRNAs in development of EOC. Collectively, the present reviews indicate that expression of SERPINB3, SERPINB11, GAL11, SPP1 and A2M is clearly associated with the development of ovarian carcinogenesis. These results provide new insights into the prognostic biomarkers for EOC to diagnose and to evaluate responses to therapies for treating EOC of humans.
