Proteins, the molecular machines encoded by our genes, serve essential roles in every living cell. Investigators were therefore surprised to find widely variable levels of a particular protein within populations of genetically identical cells. This variation in protein level, called stochasticity, arises from the chemical nature of the processes that underlie protein production. The “central dogma” of biology dictates that the DNA encoding a particular gene transmits information via RNA to molecular factories called ribosomes in order to create proteins. Each step in transcription and translation introduces some variation, or stochasticity, into the production of the protein. In the current work, we tackled how one might learn more about the machinery responsible for creating proteins by the character of the stochasticity in the central dogma process. We find that many different mechanisms can explain any given stochastic protein signature. Even though there were many explanations for any particular pattern of stochasticity, the set of explanations still inform on how a given gene creates its protein. Our mathematical and computational framework will permit others to better understand how the machinery that expresses genes works. This, in turn, will enable investigators to better predict how a given mutation is likely to affect gene expression.
