Health issues associated with excessive caloric intake and sedentary lifestyle are driving a modern “epidemic” of liver disease. Initially presenting in the clinic as an excessive accumulation of fat within hepatocyte cells (steatosis), the progression to more severe non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in which liver damage and inflammation are overt features, is becoming increasingly common. Often developing as a sequela of obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) arises in almost one-third of people initially carrying excess hepatic fat and is likely the result of the liver’s limited capacity to cope with the modern-day levels of dietary fatty acids circulating in the blood. While routine imaging can readily assess the presence and level of “extra-hepatic fat”, a proper diagnosis of disease progression to NASH is currently only possible by liver biopsy. A general reluctance to undergo such screening means that the prevalence of NASH is likely to be under reported and, thus, risk assessment for future metabolic syndrome (MetS) markedly compromised. The seemingly inevitable progression to overt insulin resistance that characterizes MetS may in part be the consequence of the body’s attempt to cope with NAFLD by driving systemic insulin sensitivity and, thus, fatty acid breakdown. The potential significance of miRNAs in both physiological homeostasis and pathogenesis is increasingly appreciated and in the liver may contribute specifically to the regulation of lipid pathways and NAFLD progression. As such, they may have utility as molecular indicators for the accurate profiling of both initial risk and disease progression from simple steatosis to NASH, and further to fibrosis/cirrhosis.
