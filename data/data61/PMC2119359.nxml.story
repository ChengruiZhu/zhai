Mice were thymectomized and depleted of CD4+ lymphocytes by treatment with monoclonal antibody to induce Pneumocystis carinii (PC) pneumonia (PCP). These mice were then exposed to aerosols of heat-treated Escherichia coli three times a week. Aerosol treatment for 10 d caused a slight reduction in numbers of PC nuclei in the lungs of mice, and treatment for 22 d resulted in nearly complete resolution of PCP. Large numbers of macrophages, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and lymphocytes accumulated in lungs of aerosol-treated mice. Depletion of either CD8+ lymphocytes or asialo GM1+ cells that remained in the mice after CD4+ cell depletion had no effect on the ability of the mice to resolve PCP after E. coli aerosol treatments. However, depletion of Thy-1+ lymphocytes in these mice abrogated their ability to resolve PCP and reduced the numbers of macrophages that accumulated in the lungs. In addition, it was found that resolution of PCP induced by heat-treated E. coli aerosol treatments was also abrogated when mice were treated with polyclonal antibodies against tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- alpha). Thus, resolution of PCP in CD4+ lymphocyte-depleted mice by heat-treated E. coli aerosols was not dependent on either CD8+ or asialo GM1+ cells but was dependent on Thy-1+CD4-CD8- lymphocytes and on the participation of TNF. These results indicate that heat-treated E. coli aerosols can act as an immune response modifier by inducing resolution of PCP in mice by a mechanism not dependent on the presence of CD4+ lymphocytes.
