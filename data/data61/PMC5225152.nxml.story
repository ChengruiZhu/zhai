Prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is high in patients with end-stage renal dysfunction, including patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). The HCV infection itself can cause glomerulonephritis and puts individuals at increased risk of developing end-stage renal disease; fortunately, successful HCV eradication sometimes restore HCV-related renal dysfunction. Moreover, the prognosis of dialysis patients infected with HCV is significantly worse and the renal allograft survival in HCV-infected patients is also worse than in dialysis patients without HCV infection. If life prognosis is favorable, therefore, anti-HCV therapy is strongly recommended for HCV-infected patients with severe renal dysfunction. The standard therapy for HCV-infected patients with severe renal dysfunction has historically been interferon-based therapy. However, this therapy remains ineffective in achieving high, sustained viral response rates and the rate of adverse events and treatment discontinuation due to treatment-induced adverse events continues to be high in patients with severe renal dysfunction. Safe and effective anti-HCV therapies are urgently needed, and crucial, for patients with severe renal dysfunction. Recently, direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) that specifically target viral proteins have been developed, and these targets include the NS3, NS5A, and NS5B of HCV. Clinical trials have revealed high efficacy and safety of the DAA-based therapies, but patients with severe renal dysfunction were not included in the majority of these trials. However, several recent reports have shown high efficacy and safety for some regimens of DAA combination therapy for HCV-infected patients with severe renal dysfunction. In this review, we discuss novel treatments for HCV-infected patients with severe renal dysfunction and the pharmacokinetics of these drugs.
