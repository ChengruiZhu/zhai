Combretastatins interrupt blood flow of solid tumor vascular networks and lead to necrosis by blocking nutrients. However, tumors recover from tumor blood flow interruption-induced damage and develop viable rims. To investigate why cancer recurs and its prevention, we used a combretastatin derivative, Cderiv (=AC7700), and analyzed changes in tumor–host interface (T-HI) vessels, which were closest to cancer cells in the tumor margin after tumor vessel disruption, and the microenvironment surrounding them. Treatment with Cderiv (10 mg/kg) interrupted tumor blood flow in all regions of LY80 (a variant of Yoshida sarcoma) tumor, but not T-HI vessel blood flow. The same Cderiv dose given 72 h after 5 Gy irradiation stopped T-HI vessel blood flow and prevented cancer recurrence. Treatment in the reverse order, however, did not affect T-HI vessel blood flow. The greatest difference between the two treatments was the occurrence of gradual T-HI edema with the former. Severe T-HI edema compressed T-HI blood vessels, so that circulation stopped. Thus, the distance between a tumor margin and its nearest functioning host vessel became much larger, and the tumor marginal region became a microenvironment that lacked a nutritional supply. Cancer cells in tumor margins received nutrients through two circulation routes: tumor vessels and T-HI vessels. Our starvation methods, which involved treatment with Cderiv 72 h after 5 Gy irradiation, blocked both circulation routes and may have great potential as a clinical strategy to prevent cancer recurrence.
