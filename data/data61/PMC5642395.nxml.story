Increasing evidence suggests a link between persistent human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection and cancer. Although the role of HCMV in cancer is still elusive, recent studies revealed the presence of HCMV nucleic acids and proteins in different cancer types such as glioblastoma, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers, and neuroblastoma. Although HCMV may not be directly associated with the neoplastic transformation, the presence of HCMV DNA in the tumorous tissue has been associated with altered clinical outcomes in cancer patients. However, the mechanisms involved in the association between colorectal cancer (CRC) and HCMV are unclear. In this study, we investigated the influence of HCMV infection on CRC or their derived cells. Proliferation and migration assays revealed a high infection efficiency in CRC-derived HT29 and SW480 'stem-like' cells. After 24, 48 and 72 h of HCMV infection, both HT29 and SW480 parental and stem-like cells showed a significant increase in cell proliferation and viability (p<0.0001). Moreover, HCMV infection promoted cell migration. These results demonstrate a significant phenotypic alteration in the CRC cell line upon HCMV infection. Using epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) assays, we demonstrated that the EMT markers and driver genes were upregulated during the virus infection. The WNT signaling pathway, which is associated with the proliferation and migration of CRC cells, was upregulated (6-fold) in HCMV-infected cells as compared to the non-infected cells at day 7 from infection.
