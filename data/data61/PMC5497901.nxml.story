Project Santa Fe was established both to provide thought leadership and to help develop the evidence base for the valuation of clinical laboratory services in the next era of American healthcare. The participants in Project Santa Fe represent major regional health systems that can operationalize laboratory-driven innovations and test their valuation in diverse regional marketplaces in the United States. We provide recommendations from the inaugural March 2016 meeting of Project Santa Fe. Specifically, in the transition from volume-based to value-based health care, clinical laboratories are called upon to provide programmatic leadership in reducing total cost of care through optimization of time-to-diagnosis and time-to-effective therapeutics, optimization of care coordination, and programmatic support of wellness care, screening, and monitoring. This call to action is more than working with industry stakeholders on the basis of our expertise; it is providing leadership in creating the programs that accomplish these objectives. In so doing, clinical laboratories can be effectors in identifying patients at risk for escalation in care, closing gaps in care, and optimizing outcomes of health care innovation. We also hope that, through such activities, the evidence base will be created for the new value propositions of integrated laboratory networks. In the very simplest sense, this effort to create “Clinical Lab 2.0” will establish the impact of laboratory diagnostics on the full 100% spend in American healthcare, not just the 2.5% spend attributed to in vitro diagnostics. In so doing, our aim is to empower regional and local laboratories to thrive under new models of payment in the next era of American health care delivery.
