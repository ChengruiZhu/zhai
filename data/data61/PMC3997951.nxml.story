Our patient was a 61-year-old man, with 75 kg weight and 180 cm height. The patient had no history of visual impairment except mild cataract in his right eye. The patient had a history of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH). The patient had undergone lumbar surgery in prone position. The operation time was about 6 hours. About 30 minutes after transferring to postanesthesia care unit (PACU), patient was awake and complained of losing his eyesight. There was no vision and light perception in his right eye on primary examination. Urgent ophthalmologist consultation was requested. In ophthalmology examinations, the pupil reflex to light was absent in the right eye. After obtaining patients and his family informed consent, four hours after the operation, 40000 I.U. of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) was administered for patient in PACU (IV infusion, in 30 min). An ophthalmologist visited him every 6 hours after administration of rhEPO. The patient was transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) one hour later with total visual loss in the right eye. Ophthalmologic examination after the second dose of rhEPO, 30 hours after the operation, reported pupil reflex enhancement and light perception in his right eye. Finally the third dose of rhEPO (40000 I.U., IV infusion) was administered on the third day. Ophthalmologic examination after the third dose of rhEPO, 60 hours after the operation, reported normal pupillary light reflex of the right eye and visual acuity improvement to 20/20. The patient was discharged from hospital after six days, with normal visual acuity and without any new complications except surgical site pain.
