Culture supernatant fluids from spleen cells from C57BL/10 or BALB/c mice neonatally treated with semiallogeneic (B 10.D2 x B10)F1 cells to induce haplotype-specific suppressor T cells and restimulated with macrophages syngeneic at I-A with the allogeneic haplotype encountered as neonates contain a soluble factor capable of suppressing primary in vitro antibody responses of normal syngeneic spleen cells in a non- antigen-specific manner. This haplotype-specific suppressor factor, TsF- H, has also been recovered in culture fluids of a T cell hybridoma produced by fusion of the AKR thymoma BW5147 and the haplotype-specific suppressor T cells. TsF-H is inactivated by low pH (3.5) trypsin, for 30 min at 50 degrees C, and has a molecular weight in the range of 45,000 to 68,000. Studies with specific immunoabsorbents demonstrate the presence of determinants encoded by the I-A subregion of the haplotype of the T cell producing TsF-H but not I-J subregion or immunoglobulin constant-region determinants on the TsF-H. Suppression is restricted to primary in vitro antibody responses, and not secondary antibody, mixed lymphocyte, or cytotoxic lymphocyte responses by spleen cells syngeneic at the I-A subregion of H-2 with the T cell producing the factor. The properties and activities of TsF-H and the haplotype- specific suppressor T cell are compared and contrasted with antigen- specific and genetically restricted suppressor T cells and their factors.
