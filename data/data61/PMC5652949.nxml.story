Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignancies, and is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Macrophages infiltrated in the tumor microenvironment (TME) called tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are key orchestrators in TME. In GC, it has been reported that infiltration of TAMs is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins in human GC tissues, but the exactly mechanism has not been clarified. In the present study, we aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanism of TAMs on GC cells. THP-1 cells were used to investigate the effects of TAMs on GC cells. The effects of invasion and migration induced by coculture with TAMs were investigated by Transwell invasion and wound healing assays. The expression of EMT-related genes and forkhead box Q1 (FOXQ1) were examined in MKN45 and MKN74 cells after being co-cultured with TAMs. The density of TAMs and the expression of FOXQ1 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in GC tissues. Our results revealed that, co-culture with TAMs promoted the invasion and migration of GC cells. Co-culture with TAMs induced EMT in GC cells. FOXQ1 is essential for TAM-induced EMT and metastasis in GC cells. Furthermore, silencing of FOXQ1 blocked the effect of TAM-enhanced EMT and metastasis of GC cells. High expression of CD68 was correlated with positive FOXQ1 expression (r=0.613; P<0.001) in clinical GC samples. Our data provided evidence that TAMs promote EMT, invasion and migration of GC cells via FOXQ1. Therefore, the TAM/FOXQ1 axis may represent a novel target for GC cells.
