Treatment planning for whole‚Äêbrain radiation treatment is technically a simple process, but in practice it takes valuable clinical time of repetitive and tedious tasks. This report presents a method that automatically segments the relevant target and normal tissues, and creates a treatment plan in only a few minutes after patient simulation. Segmentation of target and critical structures is performed automatically through morphological operations on the soft tissue and was validated by comparing with manual clinical segmentation using the Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance. The treatment plan is generated by searching a database of previous cases for patients with similar anatomy. In this search, each database case is ranked in terms of similarity using a customized metric designed for sensitivity by including only geometrical changes that affect the dose distribution. The database case with the best match is automatically modified to replace relevant patient info and isocenter position while maintaining original beam and MLC settings. Fifteen patients with marginally acceptable treatment plans were used to validate the method. In each of these cases the anatomy was accurately segmented, but the beams and MLC settings led to a suboptimal treatment plan by either underdosing the brain or excessively irradiating critical normal tissues. For each case, the anatomy was automatically segmented with the proposed method, and the automated and manual segmentations were then compared. The mean Dice coefficient was 0.97, with a standard deviation of 0.008 for the brain,
