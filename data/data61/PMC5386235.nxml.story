T cells are an essential arm of the immunity against the invasion of pathogenic agents in organisms. These specialized cells recognize foreign antigens displayed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APC) by means of the T cell receptor (TCR). Early signaling takes place in these cells through the specific clustering of TCRs, which trigger the recruitment of signaling molecules to the immune synapse (IS), a plasma membrane–associated intercellular domain important for T cell activation. In this location, several signaling molecules that include the protein kinase C-θ (PKC-θ) form microclusters that are translocated centripetally towards the center of the IS, following the retrograde movement of actin. In this study, we show that nitric oxide (NO) formed by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) regulates the translocation of PKC-θ to the IS, increasing its activation. eNOS can effectively modify β-actin by S-nitrosylation on Cys374, reducing its ability to bind profilin-1 (PFN1)—a protein required for actin polymerization—polymerize and flow from the periphery to the central region of the IS. We propose that eNOS-derived NO controls actin polymerization via S-nitrosylation of actin as one of the major driving forces for the transport of PKC-θ towards the central area of the IS, which is essential for T cell activation.
