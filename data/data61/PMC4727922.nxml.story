The discovery of RNA interference has revolutionized the decades’ old view of RNAs as mere intermediaries between DNA and proteins in the gene expression workflow. MicroRNAs (or miRNAs), in particular, have been shown to be able to both stabilize the protein output by buffering transcriptional noise and to create an effective positive interaction between the levels of their target RNAs through a simple competition mechanism known as ‘ceRNA effect’. With miRNAs commonly targeting multiple species of RNAs, the potential implication is that RNAs could regulate each other through extended miRNA-mediated interaction networks. Such cross-talk is certainly active in many specific cases (like cell differentiation), but it’s unclear whether the degree of regulation of gene expression achievable through post-transcriptional miRNA-mediated coupling can effectively overcome the one obtained through other mechanisms, e.g. by direct transcriptional control via DNA-binding factors. This work quantifies the maximal post-transcriptional regulatory power achievable by miRNA-mediated cross-talk, characterizing the circumstances in which indirect control outperforms direct one. The emerging scenario suggests that, in addition to its widely recognized noise-buffering role, miRNA-mediated control may indeed act as a master regulator of gene expression.
