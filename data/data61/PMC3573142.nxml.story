C-X-C chemokine receptor types 1/2 (CXCR1/2) may play multiple roles in the development and progression of a number of types of tumor. The abnormal expression of CXCR1/2 in various types of malignant tumors has been reported, but less is known with regard to gastric carcinoma. The present study was preliminarily conducted to elucidate the correlation between clinicopathological factors and the immunohistochemical expression of CXCR1/2 in patients with gastric carcinoma. The expression of CXCR1/2 in 69 specimens of sporadic gastric carcinoma and their corresponding non-neoplastic mucosa obtained by gastrectomy was assayed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using a polyclonal anti-CXCR1/2 antibody. ERK1/2 and AKT phosphorylation and the expression of indicators of proliferation, growth and apoptosis (Bcl-2 and Bax, Cyclin D1, EGFR and Ki-67), angiogenesis (VEGF and CD34), invasion and metastasis (MMP-9, MMP-2, TIMP-2 and E-cadherin) were also detected by IHC. A total of 68 (98.6%) of the 69 patients with gastric carcinoma were found to have positive CXCR1/2 expression, which appeared to be significantly higher in gastric carcinoma compared with corresponding non-neoplastic mucosa tissues. The expression of CXCR1/2 in gastric carcinoma was significantly associated with invasion, metastasis and TNM staging (P<0.001). Correlation analysis between CXCR1/2 and pAKT (P=0.032), pERK (P<0.001), Cyclin D1 (P=0.049), EGFR (P=0.013), Bcl-2 (P=0.003), microvessel density (P=0.001), MMP-9 (P=0.013) and MMP-2 (P=0.027) expression using the Spearman test showed significant correlation in gastric carcinoma. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that, compared with negative or weak expression, overexpression of CXCR1/2 protein was a significant risk factor for TNM stage (P<0.001). These results preliminarily suggest that CXCR1/2 may be a useful maker for progression of the tumors and a promising target for gastric carcinoma therapy.
