Peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) is an effective treatment for hematological malignancies. Mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells performs in different ways among transplantation centers. Forceful mobilization schedules are comprised of growth factor alone, chemotherapy along with growth factor and also, a newly combination of novel agent such as plerixafor with any approach. With the appearance of numerous modifications in stem cell mobilization field over the past decade and advent of novel stem cell mobilization techniques, it seems to be necessary to review recent publications about stem cell mobilization strategies to respond above cited issues. Relevant literature was identified by a PubMed search (1996â€“2016) of English-language literature using the terms mobilization, Allogeneic Stem Cells Transplantation, Autologous Stem Cells Transplantation and technical aspects of apheresis. Although many institutions have established their own procedures to improve stem cell mobilization success rates accompanying cost-effectiveness considerations, an optimal stem cell mobilization regimen and methods have not been well-defined, yet. Practical guidelines are required to address critical clinical issues including proper growth factor, the most Impressive chemotherapy and its dosage and appropriate time for leukapheresis initiation. Hence, based on literature, we prepared practical guidelines in this review.
