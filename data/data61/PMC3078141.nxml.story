To investigate the neural representations of faces in primates, particularly in
relation to their personal familiarity or unfamiliarity, neuronal activities
were chronically recorded from the ventral portion of the anterior inferior
temporal cortex (AITv) of macaque monkeys during the performance of a facial
identification task using either personally familiar or unfamiliar faces as
stimuli. By calculating the correlation coefficients between neuronal responses
to the faces for all possible pairs of faces given in the task and then using
the coefficients as neuronal population-based similarity measures between the
faces in pairs, we analyzed the similarity/dissimilarity relationship between
the faces, which were potentially represented by the activities of a population
of the face-responsive neurons recorded in the area AITv. The results showed
that, for personally familiar faces, different identities were represented by
different patterns of activities of the population of AITv neurons irrespective
of the view (e.g., front, 90Â° left, etc.), while different views were not
represented independently of their facial identities, which was consistent with
our previous report. In the case of personally unfamiliar faces, the faces
possessing different identities but presented in the same frontal view were
represented as similar, which contrasts with the results for personally familiar
faces. These results, taken together, outline the neuronal representations of
personally familiar and unfamiliar faces in the AITv neuronal population.
