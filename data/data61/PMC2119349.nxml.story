Selective expression of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) immediate-early (IE) genes leads to the presentation by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule Ld of a peptide derived from MCMV IE protein pp89 (Reddehase, M.J., J. B. Rothbard, and U.H. Koszinowski. 1989. Nature (Lond.). 337:651). Characterization of endogenous antigenic peptides identified the pp89 peptide as the nonapeptide 168YPHFMPTNL176 (del Val, M., H.-J. Schlicht, T. Ruppert, M.J. Reddehase, and U.H. Koszinowski. 1991. Cell. 66:1145). Subsequent expression of MCMV early genes prevents presentation of pp89 (del Val, M., K. Munch, M.J. Reddehase, and U.H. Koszinowski. 1989. Cell. 58:305). We report on the mechanism by which MCMV early genes interfere with antigen presentation. Expression of the IE promoter-driven bacterial gene lacZ by recombinant MCMV subjected antigen presentation of beta-galactosidase to the same control and excluded antigen specificity. The Ld-dependent presence of naturally processed antigenic peptides also in nonpresenting cells located the inhibitory function subsequent to the step of antigen processing. The finding that during the E phase of MCMV gene expression the MHC class I heavy chain glycosylation remained in an Endo H-sensitive form suggested a block within the endoplasmic reticulum/cis-Golgi compartment. The failure to present antigenic peptides was explained by a general retention of nascent assembled trimolecular MHC class I complexes. Accordingly, at later stages of infection a significant decrease of surface MHC class I expression was seen, whereas other membrane glycoproteins remained unaffected. Thus, MCMV E genes endow this virus with an effective immune evasion potential. These results also indicate that the formation of the trimolecular complex of MHC class I heavy chain, beta 2-microglobulin, and the finally trimmed peptide is completed before entering the medial-Golgi compartment.
