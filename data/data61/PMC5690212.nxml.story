Our purpose was to develop a neural network‐based registration quality evaluator (RQE) that can improve the 2D/3D image registration robustness for pediatric patient setup in external beam radiotherapy. Orthogonal daily setup X‐ray images of six pediatric patients with brain tumors receiving proton therapy treatments were retrospectively registered with their treatment planning computed tomography (CT) images. A neural network‐based pattern classifier was used to determine whether a registration solution was successful based on geometric features of the similarity measure values near the point‐of‐solution. Supervised training and test datasets were generated by rigidly registering a pair of orthogonal daily setup X‐ray images to the treatment planning CT. The best solution for each registration task was selected from 50 optimizing attempts that differed only by the randomly generated initial transformation parameters. The distance from each individual solution to the best solution in the normalized parametrical space was compared to a user‐defined error tolerance to determine whether that solution was acceptable. A supervised training was then used to train the RQE. Performance of the RQE was evaluated using test dataset consisting of registration results that were not used in training. The RQE was integrated with our in‐house 2D/3D registration system and its performance was evaluated using the same patient dataset. With an optimized sampling step size (i.e., 5 mm) in the feature space, the RQE has the sensitivity and the specificity in the ranges of 0.865–0.964 and 0.797–0.990, respectively, when used to detect registration error with mean voxel displacement (MVD) greater than 1 mm. The trial‐to‐acceptance ratio of the integrated 2D/3D registration system, for all patients, is equal to 1.48. The final acceptance ratio is 92.4%. The proposed RQE can potentially be used in a 2D/3D rigid image registration system to improve the overall robustness by rejecting unsuccessful registration solutions. The RQE is not patient‐specific, so a single RQE can be constructed and used for a particular application (e.g., the registration for images acquired on the same anatomical site). Implementation of the RQE in a 2D/3D registration system is clinically feasible.
