Actin-binding membrane proteins are involved in both adhesive interactions and motile processes. We report here the purification and initial characterization of p205, a 205-kD protein from bovine neutrophil plasma membranes that binds to the sides of actin filaments in blot overlays. p205 is a tightly bound peripheral membrane protein that cosediments with endogenous actin in sucrose gradients and immunoprecipitates. Amino acid sequences were obtained from SDS-PAGE–purified p205 and used to generate antipeptide antibodies, immunolocalization data, and cDNA sequence information. The intracellular localization of p205 in MDBK cells is a function of cell density and adherence state. In subconfluent cells, p205 is found in punctate spots along the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm and nucleus; in adherent cells, p205 concentrates with E-cadherin at sites of lateral cell–cell contact. Upon EGTA-mediated cell dissociation, p205 is internalized with E-cadherin and F-actin as a component of adherens junctions “rings.” At later times, p205 is observed in cytoplasmic punctae. The high abundance of p205 in neutrophils and suspension-grown HeLa cells, which lack adherens junctions, further suggests that this protein may play multiple roles during cell growth, adhesion, and motility. Molecular cloning of p205 cDNA reveals a bipartite structure. The COOH terminus exhibits a striking similarity to villin and gelsolin, particularly in regions known to bind F-actin. The NH
