DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that has received a great deal of attention in plants because it can be stably transmitted across generations. However, the rate of DNA methylation change, or epimutation, is greater than that of DNA mutation. In addition, different from DNA sequence, DNA methylation can vary within an individual in response to developmental or environmental cues. Whether altered characters can be passed on to the next generation via directed modifications in DNA methylation is a question of great interest. We have compared how DNA methylation changes between species, tissues, and environments using three closely related crucifers as examples. We found that DNA methylation is different between roots and shoots and changes with temperatures, but that such changes are not conserved across species. Moreover, most of the methylated sites are not conserved between species. This suggests that DNA methylation may respond to immediate fluctuations in the environment, but this response is not retained over long evolutionary periods. Thus, in contrast to transcriptional responses, conserved epigenetic responses at the level of DNA methylation are not widespread. Instead, the patterns of DNA methylation are largely determined by the evolution of genome structure, and responsive loci are likely short-lived accidents of this process.
