Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma of the (HNSCC) represents approximately 5% of malignant tumours in Italy. HNSCC are commonly treated with surgery or radiotherapy, or a combination of such therapies. The objectives of treatment are maximum cure rate balanced with organ preservation, restoration of form and function, reduction of morbidities and improvement or maintenance of the patient's quality of life. Immediate reconstructive surgery: local, regional or free flaps are now widely advised in the treatment of these patients. Microsurgical transfer requires expertise, is time and resource consuming, and as a whole requires substantial costs. These considerations introduce some concerns about the wide or indiscriminate use of free flap reconstructive surgery. When considering cost-benefit outcomes of such treatment, the main objective is undoubtedly, survival. This data is underreported in the current literature, whereas functional outcomes of free flaps have been largely diffused and accepted. This study collects data from 1178 patients treated with free flap reconstructive surgery following ablation of HNSCC in a group of Italian tertiary hospitals, all members of the Head & Neck Group affiliated with the Italian Society of Microsurgery. According to many authors, free flap surgery for HNSCC seems to be a beneficial option for treatment even in terms of survival.
