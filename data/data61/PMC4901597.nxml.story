Lisfranc injuries were identified in 28 NFL athletes in the study period, including 11 offensive players and 17 defensive players. While 2 of 28 (7.1%) players never returned to the NFL, the remaining 26 (92.9%) athletes returned to competition at a median 11.1 (interquartile range: 10.3-12.5) months from time of injury and missed a median 8.5 (6.3-13.0) NFL regular season games. Players treated non-operatively were noted to have an earlier return to play with a median absence from play of 6.2 (1.9-10.7) months and 7.0 (4.5-8.0) games compared to those treated operatively who returned after a median 11.6 (10.7-12.6) months (p=0.02) and 10.0 (7.0-13.3) games missed (p=0.09). Analysis of pre- and post-injury athletic performance revealed no statistically significant changes following return to sport after Lisfranc injury. The magnitude of change in median OPR for 3 seasons prior to index season compared to 3 seasons after index season observed in the Lisfranc-injured offensive study group, -34.8 (-64.4-1.4), was greater than that observed in the offensive control group, -18.8 (-52.9-31.5); however, these differences did not reach statistical significance (p=0.33). Similarly, the magnitude of change observed in the Lisfranc-injured defensive study group, -13.5 (-30.9-4.3), was greater than that observed in the defensive control group, -5.0 (-22.0-14.0); however, these differences also did not reach statistical significance (p=0.21).
