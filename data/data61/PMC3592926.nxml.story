DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are dangerous because they can lead to cellular death and tissue degeneration if not repaired, or to genome rearrangements, which are a common hallmark of cancer, if repaired incorrectly. Although required for all chromosomal transitions in cells, transient DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II (TOP2) is a potential endogenous source of DSBs, which are characteristic in that TOP2 remains covalently bound to the DNA termini. In addition, numerous chemotherapeutic regimes rely on compounds that “poison” TOP2 activity, stimulating the formation of DSBs that target tumour cells. However, these compounds also affect healthy tissue and confer undesirable side effects, including the stimulation of genome rearrangements that can trigger secondary malignancies (mainly acute leukemia). Identifying the factors that participate in the repair of TOP2-induced DSBs and fully understanding their mechanism of action are therefore important for the design of chemotherapeutic regimes that are more effective and safer. Here we demonstrate that TDP2, a recently identified protein that can liberate DSB termini from blocked TOP2, functions as part of established cellular DSB repair processes and is required to safeguard genome integrity upon treatment with TOP2 poisons, both in cells and in mice. These results can therefore have important implications in cancer treatment.
