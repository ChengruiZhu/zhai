Angiosarcoma is a rare malignant mesenchymal tumor with poor prognosis. We aimed to identify malignancy-associated miRNAs and their target genes, and explore biological functions of miRNA and its target in angiosarcoma. By miRNA microarrays and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, we identified 1 up-regulated miRNA (miR-222-3p) and 3 down-regulated miRNAs (miR-497-5p, miR-378-3p and miR-483-5p) in human angiosarcomas compared with human capillary hemangiomas. The intermediate-conductance calcium activated potassium channel KCa3.1 was one of the putative target genes of miR-497-5p, and marked up-regulation of KCa3.1 was detected in angiosarcoma biopsy specimens by immunohistochemistry. The inverse correlation of miR-497-5p and KCa3.1 also was observed in the ISO-HAS angiosarcoma cell line at the mRNA and protein levels. The direct targeting of KCa3.1 by miR-497-5p was evidenced by reduced luciferase activity due to complementary binding of miR-497-5p to KCa3.1 mRNA 3â€² untranslated region. For the functional role of miR-497-5p/KCa3.1 pair, we showed that application of TRAM-34, a specific KCa3.1 channel blocker, or transfection of ISO-HAS cells with KCa3.1 siRNA or miR-497-5p mimics inhibited cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and invasion by down-regulating cell-cycle related proteins including cyclin D1, surviving and P53 and down-regulating matrix metallopeptidase 9.
