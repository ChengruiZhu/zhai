The objective of this article is to present a new approach to diagnose and differentiate similar ventral masses by color Doppler. Two cases of ventral masses, a rare case of OEIS complex (Omphalocele-exstrophy-imperforate anus-spinal defects) with unusual presentation of exstrophy bladder and another of simple omphalocele, were studied by color Doppler for diagnosis and differentiation between the nature of similar masses. Ventral mass with absent bladder, normal kidneys, and normal amniotic fluid index raised the suspicion of exstrophy bladder. Color Doppler depicting altered intrafetal course of umbilical arteries and umbilical arteries coursing along the sides of ventral mass substantiated the diagnosis. The spatial relation between umbilical artery and aorta (which has no mention in the current literature) in sagittal view has been identified as an acute angle in a normal fetus and coined as “K angle” arbitrarily by the author. Color Doppler reveals altered (widened) “K angle” in exstrophy bladder compared to normal fetuses. Other combined anomalies pointed to the diagnosis of OEIS complex. The second case of simple omphalocele depicts normal intrafetal course of umbilical arteries and normal acute umbilical artery–aorta angle (K angle) on color Doppler. Color Doppler aids the early diagnosis of ventral defects. New method by umbilical artery-aorta angle (K angle) assessment on color Doppler helps differentiate exstrophy bladder from omphalocele.
