Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is one of the most common mental conditions. Proteome profiling may help identifying important proteins and finally shed lights to complexity of OCD underlying mechanisms. Here, by the application gel-based proteomic approach the proteome profile of patients with washing subtype of OCD before and after treatment with Fluoxetine (positive responders) are compared to healthy matched controls. However, only one of the differentially expressed proteins is examined and introduced in this paper. Proteomic analysis was done by the application of two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE), combined with (MALDI-TOF-TOF MS)-based. Furthermore, network analysis and biological annotation were handled by Cytoscape Plug-in and CluePedia. The proteome comparison between groups identified protein with the significant expression changes (p<0.05 and fold change â‰¥ 1.5). While the expression level of Ig Kappa Chain C Region is significantly decreased in OCD patients before any treatments, the trend is almost normalized after treatment with Fluoxetine in positive responders. In addition, interaction profile of IGKC shows that the interacting proteins may be affected as the expression pattern of IGKC changes in OCD patients. In conclusion, IGKC may be introduced as potential biomarker in our study; yet, investigation in bigger sample size and application of validation methods is a requirement.
