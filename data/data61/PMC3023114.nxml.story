Proper control of blood sugar in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is not adequate till now in spite of use of well-planned dosage regimens containing oral hypoglycemic agents/insulin or both. Recently, the role of ‘incretins,’ particularly that of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in glucose homeostasis has been firmly established. The peptide (GLP-1) increases insulin secretion while decreasing that of glucagon in response to rise in plasma glucose in addition to delay of gastric emptying time, reduction of appetite, preservation of beta-cell function, and increase in beta-cell mass all of which will contribute toward lowering of blood sugar in T2DM. But the peptide hormone cannot be used orally as such because of its very short plasma half-life (2 min) and chemical nature, which needs continuous i.v. infusion or repeated s.c. or i.v. injections at short intervals. Hence, to prolong the duration of action of endogenous GLP-1, compounds have been synthesized which inhibit the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), the enzyme responsible for metabolic degradation of GLP-1. One such compound is vildagliptin. In this article, an attempt has been made to compile some of the established recent advances in the therapeutic utility of vildagliptin along with a discussion about the physiological role of endogenous GLP-1 and its metabolism by DPP-4.
