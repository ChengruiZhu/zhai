Preoperative chemoradiotherapy has been performed as a standard therapy for advanced low rectal cancer. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been reported to contribute to resistance to treatment and patient prognosis. Leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5) and cluster of differentiation (CD133) are putative markers for CSCs. However, their prognostic ability remains unknown, and evaluation of a single marker can be insufficient due to the heterogeneity of cancer. LGR5 and CD133 expression was immunohistochemically evaluated in surgical specimens of 56 patients who received curative resection following chemoradiotherapy for advanced low rectal cancer. In addition, the correlations between their expression levels, and clinicopathological features and patient prognosis were asessed. LGR5 expression was significantly correlated with lymphatic invasion, lymph node metastasis, and tumor node metastasic (TNM) stage. CD133 expression was significantly correlated with vascular invasion and the tumor regression grade. Combined expression was significantly correlated with lymphatic invasion, tumor regression grade and TNM stage, but not with overall, and disease-free survival. LGR5 and CD133 expressions may represent useful markers associated with tumor progression and resistance to chemoradiotherapy in patients with low rectal cancer. Furthermore, combined expression of these markers may be a more useful marker compared with the expression of each single marker.
