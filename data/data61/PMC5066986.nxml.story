Understanding and preventing life-threatening irregular electrical heart rhythms includes basic experimental, numerical, and theoretical research. Computer models of the electrical dynamics of cardiac cells and impulse propagation throughout the heart are essential tools of this research. For example, simulations of electrical activity such as rotating ‘spiral waves’ have been used to understand how irregular heart rhythms are maintained. However, existing models are derived exclusively from sub-cellular data under a variety of environmental conditions and species. These models tend to be exceedingly complex including hundreds of variables and parameters which make them difficult to validate and analyze. Using experimental data from one species (rabbit) under nearly identical physiological conditions, we developed a simple model of the electrical activity of a cardiac cell derived from sub-cellular, cellular, and tissue experimental data. This model reproduces cellular excitability and its recovery as well as several important “emergent” phenomena including beat-to-beat cellular alterations and unstable spiral waves. Under some conditions, unstable spiral waves in this model give rise to continuous formation of new spiral waves (i.e., “spiral wave breakup”) which is thought to be the underlying cause of cardiac fibrillation and sudden cardiac death.
