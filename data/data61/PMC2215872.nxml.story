Light-evoked changes in membrane voltage were recorded intracellularly from rod photoreceptors in the isolated retina preparation of the toad, Bufo marinus, during superfusion with a solution containing pharmacological agents that blocked voltage-dependent conductances. Under these conditions, the amplitude of the hyperpolarizing photoresponse became much greater than under control conditions. The results of several experiments support the conclusion that this increase in photoresponse amplitude was due primarily to a voltage that was produced when the electrogenic current from the rods' Na+/K+ pump flowed across an increased membrane resistance (Torre, V. 1982. Journal of Physiology. 333:315). At the onset of a period of continuous illumination, the rod membrane first hyperpolarized and then began to repolarize, and after 180 s of illumination, the membrane voltage had recovered by 60-72% of its initial hyperpolarization. There did not appear to be any significant decrease in rod membrane resistance associated with this repolarization. Both the enhanced hyperpolarization at light onset and the slow repolarization during maintained illumination were blocked by superfusion with 10.0 microM strophanthidin. These data support the hypothesis that the activity of the rods' Na+/K+ pump declines progressively during maintained illumination. It is likely that the decline in pump activity produces significant changes in [K+]o in the subretinal space during maintained illumination.
