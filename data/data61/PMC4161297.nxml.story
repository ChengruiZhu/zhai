Somatic growth is a crucial determinant of ecological and evolutionary dynamics, since larger organisms often have higher survival and reproductive success. Size may be the result of intrinsic (i.e. genetic), environmental (temperature, food), and social (competition with conspecifics) factors and interaction between them. Knowing the contribution of intrinsic, environmental, and social factors will improve our understanding of individual population dynamics, help conservation and management of endangered species, and increase our ability to predict future growth trajectories of individuals and populations. The latter goal is also relevant for humans, since predicting future growth of newborns may help identify early pathologies that occur later in life. However, teasing apart the contribution of individual and environmental factors requires powerful and efficient statistical methods, as well as biological insights and the use of longitudinal data. We developed a novel statistical approach to estimate and separate the contribution of intrinsic and environmental factors to lifetime growth trajectories, and generate hypotheses concerning the life-history strategies of organisms. Using two fish populations as a case study, we show that our method predicts future growth of organisms with substantially greater accuracy than using historical information on growth at the population level, and help us identify year-class effects, probably associated with climatic vagaries, as the most important environmental determinant of growth.
