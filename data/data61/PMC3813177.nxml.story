A Box-Behnken design with three replicates was used for preparation and evaluation of Eudragit vancomycin (VCM) nanoparticles prepared by double emulsion. The purpose of this work was to optimize VCM nanoparticles to improve the physicochemical properties. Nanoparticles were formed by using W1/O/W2 double-emulsion solvent evaporation method using Eudragit RS as a retardant material. Full factorial design was employed to study the effect of independent variables, RPM (X1), amount of emulsifier (X2), stirring rate (X3), volume of organic phase (X4) and volume of aqueous phase (X5), on the dependent variables as production yield, encapsulation efficiency and particle size. The optimum condition for VCM nanoparticles preparation was 1:2 drug to polymer ratio, 0.2 (%w/w) amount of emulsifier , 25 mL (volume of organic phase), 25 mL (volume of aqueous phase), 3 min (time of stirring) and 26000 RPM. RPM and emulsifier concentrations were the effective factors on the drug loading (R2 = 90.82). The highest entrapment efficiency was obtained when the ratio of drug to polymer was 1:3. Zeta (Î¶) potential of the nanoparticles was fairly positive in molecular level. In vitro release study showed two phases: an initial burst for 0.5 h followed by a very slow release pattern during a period of 24 h. The release of VCM was influenced by the drug to polymer ratio and particle size and was found to be diffusion controlled. The best-fit release kinetic was achieved with Peppas model. In conclusion, the VCM nanoparticle preparations showed optimize formulation, which can be useful for oral administrations
