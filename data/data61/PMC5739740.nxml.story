HIV-infected patients exposed to antiretroviral therapy (ART) have an increased risk for hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular disease. We performed a longitudinal, comprehensive, and population-based study to investigate the cumulative effect of different types of ART regimens on hyperlipidemia risk in the Taiwanese HIV/ART cohort. A total of 13,370 HIV-infected patients (2,674 hyperlipidemia and 10,696 non-hyperlipidemia patients) were recruited after matching for age, gender, and the first diagnosis date of HIV infection by using the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. Hyperlipidemia risk associated with cumulative ART use, ART adherence, and their combination was assessed. The matched hyperlipidemia group had a larger number of patients using ART and a higher incidence of comorbidities, specifically, respiratory disease and diabetes. Patients with high ART dosage and dose-dependent manner adherence, respectively, demonstrated an increased risk of hyperlipidemia. For single ART regimens, patients receiving nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI/NRTI)- containing regimen had the highest hyperlipidemia risk, followed by protease inhibitor (PI)- containing and non-NRTI- containing regimens. For combination ART regimens, patients receiving a NRTI/NRTI + PI regimen had the highest hyperlipidemia risk. An increased cumulative drug dose was observed in patients who received the PI, NRTI/NRTI, NRTI, and NNRTI regimens in the hyperlipidemia group, when compared to the non-hyperlipidemia group. In conclusion, ART cumulative use, adherence, and regimen may affect hyperlipidemia risk among HIV-infected patients in a dose-dependent manner.
