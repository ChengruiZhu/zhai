Transepithelial fluid transport (Jv) and intracellular Na+ and Cl- activities (aNai, aCli) were measured in isolated Necturus gallbladders to establish the contribution of different proposed apical membrane entry mechanisms to transepithelial salt transport. In 10 mM HCO3- Ringer's, Jv was 13.5 +/- 1.1 microliter X cm-2 X h-1, and was significantly reduced by a low bicarbonate medium and by addition of amiloride (10(-3)M) or SITS (0.5 X 10(-3)M) to the mucosal bathing solution. Bumetanide (10(-5)M) was ineffective. Bilateral Na+ removal abolished Jv. The hypothesis of NaCl cotransport was rejected on the basis of the following results, all obtained during mucosal bathing solution changes: during Na+ removal, aNai fell 4.3 times faster than aCli; during Cl- removal, aCli fell 7.5 times faster than aNai; amiloride (10(-3) M) reduced aNai at a rate of 2.4 +/- 0.3 mM/min, whereas aCli was not changed; bumetanide (10(-5) M) had no significant effects on Jv or aCli. The hypothesis of Na-K-Cl cotransport was rejected for the same reasons; in addition, K+ removal from the mucosal bathing solution (with concomitant Ba2+ addition) did not alter aNai or aCli. The average rate of NaCl entry under normal transporting conditions, estimated from Jv, assuming that the transported fluid is an isosmotic NaCl solution, was 22.5 nmol X cm-2 X min-1. Upon sudden cessation of NaCl entry, assuming no cell volume changes, aNai and aCli should fall at an average rate of 4.8 mM/min. To compare this rate with the rates of Na+ and Cl- entry by ion exchange, the Na+ or Cl- concentration in the mucosal bathing solution was reduced rapidly to levels such that electroneutral cation or anion exchange, respectively, should cease. The rate of Na+ or Cl- entry before this maneuver was estimated from the initial rate of fall of the respective intracellular ionic activity upon the mucosal solution substitution. aNai and aCli decreased at initial rates of 3.7 +/- 0.4 and 5.9 +/- 0.8 mM/min, respectively. The rate of fall of aNai upon reduction of external [Na] was not affected by amiloride (10(-3) M), and the rate of fall of aCli upon reduction of external [Cl] was unchanged by SITS (0.5 X 10(-3) M), which indicates that net cation or anion exchange was, in fact, abolished by the changes in Na+ and Cl- gradients, respectively. I conclude that double exchange (Na+/H+ and Cl-/HCO-3) is the predominant or sole mechanism of apical membrane NaCl entry in this epithelium.
