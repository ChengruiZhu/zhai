The Tumor suppressor SMAR1 (scaffold matrix attachment region binding protein 1) has a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability, cell cycle progression and apoptosis.Our previous finding showed that it is highly suppressed in higher grade of cancer. However, the underlying mechanism of this suppression was not well understood. In this study, we show that SMAR1 expression levels are controlled at the proteasomal level by five RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligases including, Cdc20, a substrate receptor of ubiquitin ligase APC/C complex. We found that Cdc20 binds and promotes proteasomal degradation of SMAR1 in a D-box motif dependent manner. Further, our results demonstrated that Cdc20 promotes proteasomal degradation of SMAR1 through K48-linked specific polyubiquitylation, and that short hairpin RNA mediated inactivation of Cdc20 leads to significant stabilization of SMAR1. These findings suggest that Cdc20 is responsible for maintaining the cellular levels of SMAR1. However, since Cdc20 fails to target SMAR1 upon exposure to genotoxic stresses, SMAR1 helps to maintain genomic stability under these conditions through its DNA damage repair activity. Interestingly, Cdc20-mediated degradation of SMAR1 promotes cell migration and invasion.The reciprocal relationship of the duo is evident in breast cancer cell lines as well as in patient samples, suggesting that Cdc20 functions as an important negative regulator of SMAR1 in higher grades of cancer. Our study reveals for the first time, the molecular mechanism associated with lower levels of expression of the important tumor suppressor SMAR1 in higher grades of breast cancer.
