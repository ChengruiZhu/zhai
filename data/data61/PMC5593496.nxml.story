The present study was carried out to observe the impact of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) on collagen I derived from vaginal fibroblasts in the context of pelvic organ prolapse (POP), and explore the downstream effects on MAPK and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling. After treating primary cultured human vaginal fibroblasts (HVFs) derived from POP and non-POP cases with AGEs, cell counting was carried out by sulforhodamine B. The expression levels of collagen I, receptor of advanced glycation end products (RAGE), matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) were detected by western blot analysis and PCR. RAGE, MAPK and NF-κB were molecularly and pharmacologically-inhibited by siRNA, SB203580 and PDTC, respectively, and downstream changes were detected by western blot analysis and PCR. Inhibition of HVF proliferation by AGEs occurred more readily in POP patients than that noted in the controls. After treatment with AGEs, collagen I levels decreased and MMP-1 levels increased to a greater extent in the HVFs of POP than that noted in the controls. During this same period, RAGE and TIMP-1 levels remained stable. Following treatment with AGEs and RAGE pathway inhibitors by siRNA, SB203580 and PDTC, the impact induced by AGEs was diminished. The inhibition of p-p38 MAPK alone was not able to block the promoting effect of AGEs on the levels of NF-κB, which suggests that AGEs may function through other pathways, as well as p-p38 MAPK. On the whole, this study demonstrated that AGEs inhibited HVF proliferation in POP cases and decreased the expression of collagen I through RAGE and/or p-p38 MAPK and NF-κB-p-p65 pathways. Our results provide important insights into the collagen I metabolism in HVFs in POP.
