Recent studies have indicated that endothelial cell function includes elaboration of growth factors and regulation of coagulation. In this paper we demonstrate that activated coagulation Factor X (Factor Xa), a product of the coagulation mechanism generated before thrombin, induces enhanced release of endothelial cell mitogens, linking these two functions. Mitogenic activity generated by cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells in response to Factor Xa included platelet-derived growth-factor-like molecules based on a radioreceptor assay. Effective induction of mitogens by Factor Xa required the integrity of the enzyme's active center and the presence of the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-containing domain of the molecule. Factor Xa-induced release of mitogens from endothelium occurred in serum-free medium and was not altered by hirudin or antibody to Factor V, indicating that it was a direct effect of Factor Xa and was not mediated by thrombin. Elaboration of mitogenic activity required only brief contact between Factor Xa and endothelium, and occurred in a time-dependent manner. Generation of enhanced mitogenic activity in response to Factor Xa was unaffected by the presence of actinomycin D and was not associated with increased hybridization of RNA from treated cells to a v-sis probe. Release of mitogenic activity was dependent on the dose of Factor Xa, being half-maximal at 0.5 nM and reaching a maximum by 5 nM. Radioligand binding studies demonstrated a class of endothelial cell sites half-maximally occupied at a Factor Xa concentration of 0.8 nM. The close correspondence between the parameters of Factor Xa-induced mitogen release and Factor Xa binding suggests these sites may be related. When Factor X was activated on the endothelial cell surface by Factors IXa and VIII, the Factor Xa formed resulted in the induction of enhanced release of mitogenic activity. These data suggest a mechanism by which the coagulation system can locally regulate endothelial cell function and vessel wall biology before thrombin-induced release of growth factors from platelets.
