Neonatal PMN are qualitatively impaired in functions, yet they frequently reveal augmented inflammatory reactions during sepsis. Here, we hypothesized that PMN from newborns produce more IL-6 than those from adults under LPS stimulation, in which transcriptional or posttranscriptional regulation is involved in the altered expression. We found that neonatal PMN produced significantly higher IL-6 mRNA and protein than adult PMN. The higher IL-6 expression was not related to transcriptional but posttranscriptional regulation as the IL-6 expression was affected by the addition of cycloheximide but not actinomycin. To examine whether miRNA was involved in the IL-6 regulation of neonatal PMN, we surveyed differential displays of miRNAs that could potentially regulate IL-6 expression before and after LPS stimulation. Four miRNAs: hsa-miR-26a, hsa-miR-26b, hsa-miR-142-3p and hsa-let 7g decreased or increased after LPS treatment for 4 h. Further validation by qRT-PCR identified miR-26b, miR-142-3p and let-7g significantly changed in neonatal PMN after LPS stimulation. The functional verification by transfection of miR-142-3p and let-7g precursors into neonatal PMN significantly repressed the IL-6 mRNA and protein expression, suggesting that miR-142-3p and let-7g negatively regulate IL-6 expression in neonatal PMN. Modulation of miRNA expression may be used to regulate IL-6 production in newborns with altered inflammatory reactions.
