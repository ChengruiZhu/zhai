Hypoxia is a commonly encountered physiologic and pathophysiologic stress to which mammalian cells have evolved an effective adaptive response. This response is governed by a transcription factor termed the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). The mechanisms linking the cellular sensing of oxygen levels to HIF activation have been elucidated and involve oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of HIF on proline and asparagine residues by a family of hydroxylases. A key question that remains unclear is the extent to which oxygen-dependent hydroxylation occurs as a functional post-translational modification outside of the HIF pathway. This is key to developing our understanding of whether hydroxylation is a general regulatory modification or one which has specifically evolved for the regulation of HIF. Here, we demonstrate that the deubiquitinase ovarian tumor domain containing ubiquitin aldehyde binding protein 1 (OTUB1) is a target for functional hydroxylation by the FIH hydroxylase. Hydroxylation of OTUB1 by FIH on asparagine residue N22 results in a restriction in its interactome, leading us to hypothesize a possible role for hydroxylation in substrate targeting. Of interest, interactions of OTUB1 with a number of proteins involved in metabolism are altered upon removal of the hydroxylation siteâ€”implicating OTUB1 as a possible link between oxygen sensing and the regulation of metabolism.
