 It has been shown that resistance to transplanted cancer follows stimulation of the lymphoid tissue when the stimulation is induced by either heat or small doses of x-rays. In this paper we have attempted to determine whether the degree of immunity had a quantitative relation to the amount of the stimulation. Fortunately, the two methods at our disposal give stimulation of markedly different characters. The small dose of x-rays gives a sluggish lymphoid cell reaction of short duration with a definite latent period between the treatment and the evidence of marked stimulation, while after heat a short period of depression is followed by a sharp stimulation continuing over a much longer period. The cancer inoculation into groups of mice made immediately after exposure to x-rays shows little resistance, while the inoculation made at the height of the stimulation phase shows a definite increase in the immunity. Animals inoculated with cancer immediately after the heat treatment exhibit a pronounced immunity, but not so marked as that shown when the inoculation is made at the height of the stimulation. The amount of resistance shown when the cancer inoculation is made at the height of the moderately stimulating effect following exposure to x-rays, is much less than that seen when the inoculation is made at the height of the heat effect when the degree of stimulation is much greater. When the lymphocytosis sets in after the tumor graft is established only a slight effect is noted. All these results together are taken to indicate that the degree of immunity is dependent on the amount of lymphoid stimulation existing either at the time of or following soon after the cancer inoculation.
