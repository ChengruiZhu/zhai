For the majority of inoperable esophageal cancer cases, chemoradiotherapy is the most suitable treatment option. Cetuximab may provide certain benefits, however, this can be an expensive therapy. Additionally, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is typically contraindicated for esophageal cancer due to the potential for esophageal perforation and stenosis. The use of combined chemotherapy plus endostar with sequential SBRT for the treatment of esophageal squamous cancer has not been reported. In the current study, the case of a 71-year-old female with esophageal squamous cancer diagnosed 2 years prior is presented. Surgery and four cycles of cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy had been administered. The patient showed recurrence at the paratracheal lymph node, exhibited severe dyspnea (grade III) and required a semi-liquid diet. Four cycles of the docetaxel, 5-fluorouracil and nedaplatin regimen plus endostar (3 mg; days 1â€“14; intravenously) with sequential SBRT (3300 cGy in 10 fractions) was administered. Following treatment, the symptoms of the patient completely disappeared, and objective efficacy evaluation indicated complete remission. At the time of writing, the patient is living without discomfort and the progression-free survival is >8 months. In conclusion, the present case indicates that combined treatment of chemotherapy and endostar with sequential stereotactic radiotherapy is a safe and effective option for the management of esophageal cancer.
