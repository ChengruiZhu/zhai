Adipocyte dysfunction may be a critical link between obesity and insulin resistance as a result of abnormal fat storage and mobilization. Adipocytes uniquely secrete adipokines and cytokines, such as leptin and TNFα, wich promote insulin sensitivity. Previously we reported insulin-signaling related altered gene expression in animals exposed to 2-Aminoanthracene (2AA). 2AA is an amino-substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon used in manufacturing dyes, chemicals, inks, resins, and polyurethanes. The objective of this study was to examine the inflammation related effects of 2AA exposure from gestation to postnatal period on dams that ingested 2AA. To examine 2AA effects, pregnant dams were assigned into dose regimens of 2AA. Dams were fed 2AA contaminated diet during the period of gestation and postpartum. The expression of key gene transcripts reported to be important in mediating inflammatory processes was examined via quantitative RT-PCR. Histologic examination of adipose tissue (AT) was also carried out to understand the anatomy of AT due to 2AA exposure during gestation and two weeks postpartum. Examination of the adipose tissue for microscopic changes revealed no alterations between control and low-dose animals. However, AT of the high-dose animals was infiltrated by increased numbers of CD68+mononuclear cells (macrophages) and small numbers of eosinophils and mast cells, consistent with inflammation. In addition, analysis of the mRNA expression of cytokines and adipokines demonstrated the importance of inflammation in AT dysfunction. For instance, TNFα, LEPTIN and IL-6 transcripts were relatively more expressed in the low dose animals than in the high dose and control rats. At the protein level, however, high amounts of cytokines were noted. The effects of 2AA on pregnant dams appear to be more pronounced in the high dose group than in the low dose group, possibly indicating increased susceptibility of rat offspring within this group to elicit a diabetic-type response.
