More than 250 microbial genomes have been sequenced to date. A significant proportion of the genes in these genomes have no apparent similarity to known genes and their functions are unknown (i.e., they appear to be novel). As the number of sequenced genomes increases, the number of these novel genes continues to increase. In this paper, the authors now show, through an analysis of a diverse range of prokaryotic genomes, that novel genes are more prevalent in regions called genomic islands. Genomic islands are clusters of genes in genomes that show evidence of horizontal origins. This study is notable since genomic islands disproportionately contain many genes of medical, agricultural, and environmental importance (e.g., animal and plant pathogen virulence factors, antibiotic resistance genes, phenolic degradation genes, etc.). The observation that high proportions of novel genes are also localized to genomic islands suggests that microbes may have access to a larger “arsenal” of novel genes for important adaptations than previously thought. These results also imply that there are different gene pools associated with recently horizontally transmitted genomic regions versus regions that are primarily vertically inherited. The authors suggest that further studies involving large-scale environmental genomic sampling are required to help characterize this understudied gene pool.
