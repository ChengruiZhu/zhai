As a result of high throughput sequencing technologies, there is a growing need to provide fast and accurate computational tools to predict the function of proteins from amino acid sequence. Most methods that attempt to do this rely on transferring function annotations between closely related proteins; however, a large proportion of unannotated proteins are orphans and do not share sufficient similarity to other proteins to be annotated in this way. Methods that target the annotation of these difficult proteins are feature-based methods and utilise relationships between the physical characteristics of proteins and function to make predictions. One important characteristic of proteins that remains unexploited in these feature-based methods is native structural disorder. Disordered regions of proteins are thought to adopt little or no regular structure and have been experimentally linked with the correct functioning of many proteins. Additionally, disordered regions of proteins can be successfully predicted from amino acid sequence. To address the requirement for protein function prediction methods that target the annotation of orphan proteins and explore the use of information describing protein disorder, a machine learning method for predicting protein function from sequence has been implemented. The inclusion of disorder features significantly improves prediction accuracies for many function categories relating to molecular recognition. The practical utility of the method is also demonstrated by providing annotations for a set of orphan and unannotated human proteins.
