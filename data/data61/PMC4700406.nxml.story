Asthma is a well-known inflammatory lung disease; however, the specific underlying mechanism is largely unknown. We previously demonstrated that alloferon effectively downregulates pulmonary inflammation. In this study, we examined whether alloferon has a therapeutic effect on asthma. Alloferon remarkably decreased the number of eosinophils, macrophages, and neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma mice. It was synergistically decreased with 2.5 mg/kg prednisolone (PDA). Inflammatory cell infiltration around the bronchioles and in the alveolus of OVA-induced asthma mice was effectively prevented by alloferon alone and combined treatment with alloferon and PDS. The production of IL-5 and IL-17 was decreased by alloferon alone and combined treatment with alloferon and PDS. There was no change the level of total immunoglobulin (Ig) following alloferon administration; however, total Ig was decreased by PDS. IgG2a levels were not changed by either alloferon alone or alloferon in combination with PDS. However, the levels of OVA-specific IgG1 and IgE were decreased by alloferon and PDS. In conclusion, our results suggest that a combination of alloferon and prednisolone is effective for the treatment of asthma, as it prevents inflammatory cell infiltration via the downregulation of IL-5 and IL-17 production and decreases IgG1 and IgE production via the suppression of T helper type 2 immune response.
