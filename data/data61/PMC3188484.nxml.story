Current computer vision algorithms reproducing the feed-forward features of the primate visual pathway still fall far behind the capabilities of human subjects in detecting objects in cluttered backgrounds. Here we investigate the possibility that recurrent lateral interactions, long hypothesized to form cortical association fields, can account for the dependence of object detection accuracy on shape complexity and image exposure time. Cortical association fields are thought to aid object detection by reinforcing global image features that cannot easily be detected by single neurons in feed-forward models. Our implementation uses the spatial arrangement, relative orientation, and continuity of putative contour elements to compute the lateral contextual support. We designed synthetic images that allowed us to control object shape and background clutter while eliminating unintentional cues to the presence of an otherwise hidden target. In contrast, real objects can vary uncontrollably in shape, are camouflaged to different degrees by background clutter, and are often associated with non-shape cues, making results using natural image sets difficult to interpret. Our computational model of cortical association fields matches many aspects of the time course and object detection accuracy of human subjects on statistically identical synthetic image sets. This implies that lateral interactions may selectively reinforce smooth object global boundaries.
