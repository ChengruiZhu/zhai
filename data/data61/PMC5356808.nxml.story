Myocardial fibrosis leads to a restrictive diastolic filling pattern of the left ventricle which is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with heart failure. We investigated the relationship between cardiac fibrosis and restrictive filling pattern of the left ventricle measured by Tc99m left ventriculography in patients with chronic symptomatic heart failure. Serum cardiac extracellular matrix markers including type I and III aminoterminal propeptide of procollagen (PINP and PIIINP), matrix metalloproteinase-2,9 (MMP-2,9), and tissue inhibitor of MMP-1 (TIMP-1) were analyzed. Fifty-one (39 males) patients were enrolled. Their median age was 51.8 years, and median left ventricular ejection fraction was 31.9%. Time to peak filling rate of the left ventricle was significantly correlated with serum levels of the three cardiac extracellular matrix markers (TIMP-1, PIIINP, and MMP-2). The patients with a restrictive diastolic filling pattern of the left ventricle (time to peak filling rate = 154 ms) had significantly higher levels of these extracellular matrix markers. In receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, areas under the curve of PIIINP, TIMP-1, and MMP-2 were 0.758, 0.695, and 0.751 to predict the presence of a restrictive pattern. In C-statistics, all three cardiac extracellular matrix markers significantly increased the area under the curve after adding creatinine. In net reclassification improvement and integrated discrimination improvement models, PIIINP and MMP-2 significantly improved the predictive power of age, creatinine and brain natriuretic peptide. In conclusion, serum extracellular matrix markers are significantly correlated with restrictive diastolic filling pattern of the left ventricle in patients with heart failure.
