Cell membranes and membrane-based organelles actively mediate several intracellular signaling and trafficking decisions. A growing number of applications rely on cooperative interactions between molecular assemblies and membranes. Yet, the studies of membrane-based and membrane-mediated signaling are not considered core aspects of systems biology. While a coherent and complete description of cell membrane-mediated signaling is not always possible by experimental methods, multiscale modeling and simulation approaches can provide valuable insights at microscopic and mesoscopic scales. Here, we present a quantitative model for describing how cell-membrane topologies are actively mediated and manipulated by intracellular protein assemblies. Specifically, the model describes a crucial step in the intracellular endocytic trafficking mechanisms, i.e., active transport mechanisms mediated through budding of the cell membrane orchestrated by protein-interaction networks. The proposed theory and modeling approach is expected to create avenues for many novel applications in systems biology, pharmacology, and nanobiotechnology. The particular application to endocytosis explored here can help discern pathological cellular trafficking fates of receptors implicated in a variety of biomedical conditions such as cancer, as well as impact the technology of targeted drug delivery in nanomedicine.
