Attention can select stimuli in space based on the stimulus features most relevant for a task. Attention effects have been linked to several important phenomena such as modulations in neuronal spiking rate (i.e., the average number of spikes per unit time) and spike-spike synchrony between neurons. Attention has also been associated with spike count correlations, a measure that is thought to reflect correlated noise in the population of neurons. Here, we studied whether feature-based attention biases the correlated activity between neurons when attention is directed towards their common preferred feature. Simultaneous single-unit recordings were obtained from multiple neurons in secondary somatosensory cortex in non-human primates performing feature-attention tasks. Both firing rate and spike-synchrony were enhanced when attention was directed towards the preferred feature of cells. However, attention effects on spike-synchrony had a tighter relationship with behavior. Further, attention decreased spike-count correlations when it was directed towards the receptive field of cells. Our data indicate that temporal correlation codes play a role in mediating feature selection, and are consistent with a feature-based selection model that operates by reducing the overall noise in a population and synchronizing activity across subpopulations that encode the relevant features of sensory stimuli.
