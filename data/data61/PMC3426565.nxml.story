Many tissues and organs, including sensory organs like the vertebrate retina and inner ear, are built from sheets of connected cells called epithelia. The precise arrangement of different types of cells within these epithelia can be essential to their function. (For example, photoreceptor cells in eyes must be properly spaced to collect an optimal, undistorted signal.) We combine experimental observations with computational modeling to understand how a particular example of such epithelial organization—the planar crystalline packing of cone photoreceptor cells in the fish retina—is created. Specifically, we introduce a model where the strength of cell-cell adhesion along an interface depends on the orientation of that interface. When a global mechanical compression is applied along one direction, this model can recapitulate observed features of the cone packing and gives qualitatively correct predictions of the cone photoreceptor pattern observed in regenerated and mutant retinas. Our analysis shows that simple local interactions can direct the creation of regular, long-ranged order among epithelial cells, and it also clarifies the mechanical interactions needed to establish and maintain the integrity of the retinal epithelium. Our model may thus ultimately provide a foundation for insights into diseases in which epithelial integrity is lost.
