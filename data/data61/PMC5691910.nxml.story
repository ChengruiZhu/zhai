High drug resistance, poor water solubility, short half-life, and low local drug concentration are obstacles for successful delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs for lung cancer. A new method involving the use of nanoparticles (NPs) for pulmonary delivery is proposed. However, use of NPs is limited by the particle size range for pulmonary drug delivery considering that NPs cannot be deposited directly into the lungs. NPs polymerized into microspheres (polymeric microspheres, PMs) will result in suitable particle sizes and retain the advantages of nanodrugs after redispersion when applied in pulmonary delivery. We report the development of novel NPs in the form of PMs loaded with paclitaxel (PTX) and quercetin (QUE) double drugs based on the synthesis of oleic acid-conjugated chitosan (OA-CTS) for pulmonary delivery. This approach is aimed toward prolonging PTX retention time in the presence of QUE and bypassing P-glycoprotein drug efflux pumps. NPs loaded with PTX or QUE were prepared with 11% substitution degree using OA-CTS as the carrier by ionic cross-linking method, which NPs loaded with PTX or QUE were used in the preparation of PMs by spray-drying. The diameters of the PMs ranged from 1 to 5 Î¼m which had uniform size range. Scanning electron microscopy showed that PMs were polymers formed by a large number of NPs and readily redispersed (after redispersion, size of NPs ranged between 250 and 350 nm) in water within 1 h. PMs displayed slow-release characteristics at pH 4.5 and 7.4. The in vivo pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies suggested that PMs exhibit prolonged circulation time and a markedly high accumulation in the lung. The obtained results indicate that PMs can serve as a promising pulmonary delivery system for combined pharmacotherapy using hydrophobic anticancer drugs.
