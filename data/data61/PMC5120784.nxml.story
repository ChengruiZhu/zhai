Complex patterns of activity in each individual human brain generate the unique range of thoughts and behaviors that person experiences. Individual differences in ability, age, state of mind, and other characteristics are tied to differences in brain activity, but determination of the exact nature of these relationships has been limited by the intrinsic complexity of the brain. Here, we apply dynamic network theory to quantify fundamental features of individual neural activity. We represent functional connections between brain regions as a time varying network, and then identify groups of these interactions that exhibit similar behavior over time. The result of this construction is referred to as a hypergraph, and each grouping within the hypergraph is called a hyperedge. We find that the number of these hyperedges in an individual’s hypergraph is a trait-like metric, with considerable variation across the population of subjects, but remarkable consistency within each subject as they perform different tasks. We find a significant correspondence between this metric and the subject’s age, indicating that the dynamics of functional brain activity in older individuals tends to be more dynamically segregated. This new insight into age-related changes in the dynamics of cognitive processing expands our knowledge of the effects of age on brain function and confirms our methods as promising for quantifying and examining individual differences.
