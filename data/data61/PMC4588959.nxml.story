An accurate and consistent measurement of shoulder range of motion (ROM) is of vital importance in the examination and functional evaluation of the shoulder. Classically, shoulder ROM is measured using a goniometer for research purposes, although clinically, visual estimation is typically utilized given its efficiency and providersâ€™ lack of access to a goniometer.While visual estimation is likely sufficient for a single provider to follow a patient over time, it has been demonstrated to have very low interobserver reliability, especially for patients with pain or shoulder pathology. Current medical practice has led most orthopaedic surgeons to rely heavily on residents and physician assistants, especially in the clinic setting. Despite the importance of accurate and consistent measurement of shoulder ROM, a reliable and reproducible method of measurement for all levels of care providers does not exist. A widely-available and low-cost alternative for measurement of shoulder ROM is the Clinometer application (Plaincode Software Solutions) available inexpensively to all iPhone and smartphone users. Such a readily-available and accurate device could provide practicioners with a much simpler method for measuring shoulder ROM, as well as allowing physician extenders, primary care physicians and other non-orthopaedic trained physicians to easily obtain reproducible shoulder ROM measurements. The goal of this study is to establish the validity and reliability of shoulder ROM measurements amongst varying types of healthcare providers using the Clinometer application in healthy adult patients and compare these results to goniometry.
