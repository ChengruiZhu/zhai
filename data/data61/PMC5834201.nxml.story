To produce unimpaired sperm, precise activation of germline-specific genes is an essential step during the late stages of spermatogenesis. However, sex chromosomes carrying these genes become silenced in a chromosome-wide manner during meiosis in a process called meiotic sex chromosome inactivation. Sex chromosome inactivation is maintained from meiosis into postmeiotic spermatids. Thus, to ensure the function of sex chromosome-linked (sex-linked) genes required for male reproduction, these genes must escape silencing for activation in spermatids. Here, we unravel the epigenetic mechanisms that underlie the activation of sex-linked genes from otherwise inactive sex chromosomes in the male germline. We determine the mechanism by which two factors regulate gene activation: one is RNF8, a DNA damage response protein, and the other is SCML2, a germline-specific Polycomb protein. Our data suggest that, during meiosis, RNF8 and SCML2 cooperate to regulate ubiquitination, which establishes active epigenetic modifications on enhancers and promoters for subsequent gene activation; these memories are maintained through meiotic divisions to induce gene activation in spermatids. Importantly, this study uncovers novel epigenetic mechanisms that underlie specific gene activation in spermatids and illuminates potential causes of male infertility.
