Neurons are the fundamental components of the nervous system and a quantitative description of their properties is a prerequisite to understanding the complex structures they comprise, from microcircuits to networks. Mathematical modelling provides an essential tool to this end and there has been intense effort directed at analysing networks constructed from different classes of neurons. However, even neurons from the same class show a broad variability in parameter values and the distributions and correlations between these parameters are likely to significantly affect network properties. To quantify this variability, we used a combination of intracellular recording, single-neuron modelling, and statistical analysis to measure the physiological variability in pyramidal-cell populations of the neocortex. We employ protocols that measure parameters from both square-pulse and naturalistic stimuli, characterising the perisomatic integration properties of these cells and allowing for the straightforward extraction of mathematically tractable reduced neuron models. We provide algorithms to generate populations of these neuron models that respect the parameter variability and co-variability observed in our experiments. These represent novel tools for exploring heterogeneity in neocortical networks that will be useful for subsequent theoretical and numerical studies. Finally, we make our full electrophysiological dataset available for other research groups to extend and improve on our analysis.
