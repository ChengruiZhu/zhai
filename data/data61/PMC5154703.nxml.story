Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary malignant tumor of bone and the third most common cancer in childhood and adolescence. However, controversy concerning the ideal combination of chemotherapy agents ensued throughout the last quarter of the 20th century because of conflicting and often nonrandomized data. Collaborative efforts to increase understanding of the biology of osteosarcoma and the use of preclinical models to test novel protein targets will be critical to identify the path toward improving outcomes for patients. We attempted to identify potential protein markers or therapy targets of osteosarcoma and give a glance at tumorigenesis of osteosarcoma. A sensitive and accurate method was employed in comparative proteomic analysis between benign tumor and osteosarcoma. Tumor tissues obtained by open biopsy before induction chemotherapy were investigated With 2D DIGE and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS, 22 differentially expressed proteins were identified after database searching, including 8 up-regulated and 14 down-regulated proteins. We also validated the expression levels of interesting proteins(have higher Ratios(tumor/normal)) by Western blotting assay. Annotating by bioinformatic tools, we found structural and signal transduction associated proteins were in large percentage among altered level proteins. In particular, some low abundant proteins involving translation and transcription, such as EEF2(Elongation Factor 2), LUM Lumican 23Â kDa Protein) and GTF2A2(Transcription Initiation Factor Iia Gamma Chain.), were firstly reported by our study comparing to previous observations. Our findings suggest that these differential proteins may be potential biomarkers for diagnosis or molecules for understanding of osteosarcoma tumorigenesis, coming with biologic, preclinical, and clinical trial efforts being described to improve outcomes for patients.
