Recipient-antidonor alloreactivity before HLA genotypically identical bone marrow transplantation (BMT) between donor-recipient pairs that are negative in the mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), the cell-mediated lympholysis (CML) assay, and the lymphocyte crossmatch was not detectable in the majority of cases, using recipient peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) collected before BMT as responder cells and donor PBL as stimulator cells. However, when donor bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) instead of PBL were used as stimulator cells, we could detect donor-specific alloreactivity in 7 of 10 HLA genotypically identical donor-recipient pairs. To demonstrate that this alloreactivity was minor histocompatibility (mH) antigen specific and not directed against HLA class I splits or variants, two cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) lines were tested in further detail against phytohemagglutinin (PHA) blasts from pairs of HLA genotypically identical siblings positive for the HLA class I restriction molecule. Both CTL lines recognized mH antigens, as illustrated by the differential recognition of PHA blasts of one of the two siblings from several pairs. The potential role of these mH antigen- specific CTLs in bone marrow graft rejection was demonstrated by the mH antigen-specific growth inhibition of hematopoietic progenitor cells from the original bone marrow donor and from HLA class I restriction molecule-positive individuals who expressed the mH antigens on their PBL and BMMNC. Our assay can be used in HLA genotypically identical BMT to detect a recipient-antidonor response, directed against cellularly defined mH antigens expressed on donor HPC, BMMNC, and PBL, before transplantation.
