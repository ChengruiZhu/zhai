Stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors activates type I and II cyclic AMP–dependent protein kinase A, resulting in phosphorylation of various proteins in the heart. It has been proposed that PKA II compartmentalization by A-kinase–anchoring proteins (AKAPs) regulates cyclic AMP–dependent signaling in the cell. We investigated the expression and localization of AKAP100 in adult hearts. By immunoblotting, we identified AKAP100 in adult rat and human hearts, and showed that type I and II regulatory (RI and II) subunits of PKA are present in the rat heart. By immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy of rat cardiac myocytes and cryostat sections of rat left ventricle papillary muscles, we localized AKAP100 to the nucleus, sarcolemma, intercalated disc, and at the level of the Z-line. After double immunostaining of transverse cross-sections of the papillary muscles with AKAP100 plus α-actinin–specific antibodies or AKAP100 plus ryanodine receptor–specific antibodies, confocal images showed AKAP100 localization at the region of the transverse tubule/junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum. RI is distributed differently from RII in the myocytes. RII, but not RI, was colocalized with AKAP100 in the rat heart. Our studies suggest that AKAP100 tethers PKA II to multiple subcellular compartments for phosphorylation of different pools of substrate proteins in the heart.
