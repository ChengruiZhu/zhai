The world population is getting old rapidly; the aging population is the new phenomenon in Iran too. The aim of this meta-analysis was to estimate the overall and subscales mean score of quality of life (QOL) based on the Leiden-Padua (LEIPAD) questionnaire among the elderly population of Iran. The major international and national databases including; Medlin, Scopus, Science Direct, SID, MagIran, IranMedex, and Irandoc was searched. All cross-sectional studies, which measured the QOL among the elderly population in Iran using the LEIPAD questionnaire, were included. Furthermore, we used the following key words, “Quality of life,” “aging,” “aged,” “elderly,” and “Iran.” Of 2155 records, four articles reminded for the meta-analysis, which involved 628 participants with a mean age of 71.73 ± 4.28 years. The mean scores of QOL in each scale were as follows: 10.80 (9.30–12.31) for physical health, 13.51 (6.81–20.21) for self-care scale, 8.60 (5.07–12.14) for depression and anxiety, 12.48 (10.39–14.58) for cognitive functioning scale, 2.19 (0.67–3.72) for sexual functioning scale, 10.98 (5.87–16.09) for life satisfaction scale, and 5.90 (3.64–8.16) for social desirability scale. This study revealed that the total QOL for the elderly population is relatively low in Iranian society. It is appeared to provide social support, and upgrade their QOL seems to be essential for the elderly population.
