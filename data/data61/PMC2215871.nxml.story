Changes in membrane current in response to an elevation of [Na]i were studied in enzymatically dispersed frog atrial cells. Na loading by either intracellular dialysis or exposure to the Na ionophore monensin produces changes in membrane current that resemble the "creep currents" originally observed in cardiac Purkinje fibers during exposure to low-K solutions. Na loading induces a transient outward current during depolarizing voltage-clamp pulses, followed by an inward current in response to repolarization back to the holding potential. In contrast to cardiac Purkinje fibers, Na loading of frog atrial cells induces creep currents without accompanying transient inward currents. Creep currents induced by Na loading are insensitive to K channel antagonists like Cs and 4-aminopyridine; they are not influenced by doses of Ca channel antagonists that abolish iCa, but are sensitive to changes in [Ca]o or [Na]o. A comparison of the time course of development of inward creep currents are not tail currents associated with iCa. Inward creep currents can also be induced by experimental interventions that increase the iCa amplitude. Exposure to isoproterenol enhances the iCa amplitude and induces inward creep currents; both can be attenuated by Ca channel antagonists. Both inward and outward creep currents are blocked by low doses of La, independently of La's ability to block iCa. It is concluded that (a) creep currents are not mediated by voltage- gated Na, Ca, or K channels or by an electrogenic Na,K pump; (b) inward creep currents induced either by Na loading or in response to an increase in the amplitude of iCa are triggered by an elevation of [Ca]i; and (c) creep currents may be generated by either an electrogenic Na/Ca exchange mechanism or by a nonselective cation channel activated by [Ca]i.
