The noisy threshold regime, where even a small set of presynaptic neurons can significantly affect postsynaptic spike-timing, is suggested as a key requisite for computation in neurons with high variability. It also has been proposed that signals under the noisy conditions are successfully transferred by a few strong synapses and/or by an assembly of nearly synchronous synaptic activities. We analytically investigate the impact of a transient signaling input on a leaky integrate-and-fire postsynaptic neuron that receives background noise near the threshold regime. The signaling input models a single strong synapse or a set of synchronous synapses, while the background noise represents a lot of weak synapses. We find an analytic solution that explains how the first-passage time (ISI) density is changed by transient signaling input. The analysis allows us to connect properties of the signaling input like spike timing and amplitude with postsynaptic first-passage time density in a noisy environment. Based on the analytic solution, we calculate the Fisher information with respect to the signaling input’s amplitude. For a wide range of amplitudes, we observe a non-monotonic behavior for the Fisher information as a function of background noise. Moreover, Fisher information non-trivially depends on the signaling input’s amplitude; changing the amplitude, we observe one maximum in the high level of the background noise. The single maximum splits into two maximums in the low noise regime. This finding demonstrates the benefit of the analytic solution in investigating signal transfer by neurons.
