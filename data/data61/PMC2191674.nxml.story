Systemic and localized inflammation elicit a number of host responses which include fever, cachexia, hypoglycemia, and major changes in the concentration of liver plasma proteins. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is considered an important mediator of the inflammatory response, together with IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). The purpose of this study was to unequivocally determine the role of IL-6 in these phenomena making use of IL-6-deficient mice that we have recently generated by gene targeting. We report here that in the absence of IL- 6, mice are unable to mount a normal inflammatory response to localized tissue damage generated by turpentine injection. The induction of acute phase proteins is dramatically reduced, mice do not lose body weight and only suffer from mild anorexia and hypoglycemia. In contrast, when systemic inflammation is elicited through the injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), these parameters are altered to the same extent both in wild-type and IL-6-deficient mice, demonstrating that under these conditions IL-6 function is dispensable. Moreover, we show that LPS-treated IL-6-deficient mice produce three times more TNF-alpha than wild-type controls, suggesting that increased TNF-alpha production might be one of the compensatory mechanisms through which a normal response to LPS is achieved in the absence of IL-6. We also show that corticosterone is normally induced in IL-6-deficient mice, demonstrating that IL-6 is not required for the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Our results reinforce the idea that different patterns of cytokines are involved in systemic and localized tissue damage, and identify IL-6 as an essential mediator of the inflammatory response to localized inflammation.
