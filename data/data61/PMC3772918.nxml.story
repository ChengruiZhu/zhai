Acquired perforating dermatosis (APD) is a rare disorder characterized by transepidermal elimination of contents from dermis with minimal disruption of surrounding structures, believed to be due to altered expression of dermal proteins. Its occurrence in patients with systemic mycosis has never been reported. We report a 60-y gentleman who presented with features of adrenal insufficiency (nausea vomiting, hypotension and increased pigmentation) for 4 mo, multiple hyperpigmented pruritic nodules with central keratinous plug over extensor surface of both lower limbs along with hepatosplenomegaly of one month duration. Investigations revealed low cortisol (2.3 μg/dl; normal: 5–34 μg/dl), elevated ACTH (68 pg/ml; normal: 5–15 pg/ml), enlarged bilateral adrenals with hepatosplenomegaly on CT. Methanamine silver staining of fine needle aspiration from the adrenals and bone marrow aspiration showed numerous oval yeast cells suggestive of histoplasma. Histopathology of biopsy of one of the skin nodules revealed transepidermal elimination process characterized by invagination of epidermis with extrusion of collagen bundles suggestive of APD. Patient improved with hydrocortisone replacement and there was clinical improvement with resolution of skin lesions following amphotericin-B and itraconazole therapy. This is probably the first reported case of APD in a patient with disseminated histoplasmosis who had presented with Addison’s disease.
