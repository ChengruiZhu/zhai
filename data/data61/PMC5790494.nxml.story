The coexistence of endometriosis (ES) with ovarian clear cell carcinoma (CCC) or endometrioid carcinoma (EC) suggested that malignant transformation of ES leads to endometriosis associated ovarian carcinoma (EAOC). However, there is still lack of an integrating data analysis of the accumulated experimental data to provide the evidence supporting the hypothesis of EAOC transformation. Herein we used a function-based analytic model with the publicly available microarray datasets to investigate the expression profiling between ES, CCC, and EC. We analyzed the functional regularity pattern of the three type of samples and hierarchically clustered the gene sets to identify key mechanisms regulating the malignant transformation of EAOC. We identified a list of 18 genes (NLRP3, AIM2, PYCARD, NAIP, Caspase-4, Caspase-7, Caspase-8, TLR1, TLR7, TOLLIP, NFKBIA, TNF, TNFAIP3, INFGR2, P2RX7, IL-1B, IL1RL1, IL-18) closely related to inflammasome complex, indicating an important role of inflammation/immunity in EAOC transformation. We next explore the association between these target genes and patient survival using Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and found significant correlation between the expression levels of the target genes and the progression-free survival. Interestingly, high expression levels of AIM2 and NLRP3, initiating proteins of inflammasomes, were significantly correlated with poor progression-free survival. Immunohistochemistry staining confirmed a correlation between high AIM2 and high Ki-67 in clinical EAOC samples, supporting its role in disease progression. Collectively, we established a bioinformatic platform of gene-set integrative molecular functionome to dissect the pathogenic pathways of EAOC, and demonstrated a key role of dysregulated inflammasome in modulating the malignant transformation of EAOC.
