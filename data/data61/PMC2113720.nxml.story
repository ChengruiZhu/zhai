An integral membrane protein associated with sites of microfilament- membrane attachment has been identified by a newly developed IgG1 monoclonal antibody. This antibody, MAb 30B6, was derived from hybridoma fusion experiments using intact mitotic cells of chick embryo fibroblasts as the immunization vehicle as well as the screening probe for cell surface antigens. In immunofluorescent experiments with fixed cells, MAb 30B6 surface labeling is uniquely correlated with microfilament distributions in the cleavage furrow region of dividing chick embryo fibroblasts and cardiac myocytes in culture. The MAb 30B6 antigen in addition is associated with microfilament-membrane attachment sites in interphase fibroblasts at the dorsal surface, the adhesion plaque region at the ventral surface, and at junction-like regions of cell-cell contact. It is also found co-localized with the membrane-dense plaques of smooth muscle. The MAb 30B6 antigen is expressed in a wide number of chicken cell types (particularly smooth muscle cells, platelets, and endothelial cells), but not in erythrocytes. Some of the molecular characteristics of the MAb 30B6 antigen have been determined from immunoblotting, immunoaffinity chromatography, immunoprecipitation, cell extraction, and charge shift electrophoresis experiments. It is an integral sialoglycoprotein with an apparent molecular mass of 130 kD (reduced form)/107 kD (nonreduced form) in SDS PAGE. Another prominent glycoprotein species with an apparent molecular mass of 175 kD (reduced form)/165 kD (nonreduced form) in SDS PAGE is co-isolated on MAb 30B6 affinity columns, but appears to be antigenically distinct since it is not recognized by MAb 30B6 in immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation experiments. By virtue of its surface distributions relative to actin microfilaments and its integral protein character, we propose that the MAb 30B6 antigen is an excellent candidate for the function of directly or indirectly anchoring microfilaments to the membrane.
