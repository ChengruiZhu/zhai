The voltage-dependent gating mechanism of A1-type potassium channels coded for by the Shaker locus of Drosophila was studied using macroscopic and single-channel recording techniques on embryonic myotubes in primary culture. From a kinetic analysis of data from single A1 channels, we have concluded that all of the molecular transitions after first opening, including the inactivation transition, are voltage independent and therefore not associated with charge movement through the membrane. In contrast, at least some of the activation transitions leading to first opening are considerably voltage dependent and account for all of the voltage dependence seen in the macroscopic currents. This mechanism is similar in many ways to that of vertebrate neuronal voltage-sensitive sodium channels, and together with the sequence similarities in the S4 region suggests a conserved mechanism for voltage-dependent gating among channels with different selectivities. By testing independent and coupled models for activation and inactivation we have determined that the final opening transition and inactivation are not likely to arise from the independent action of multiple subunits, each with simple gating transitions, but rather come about through their aggregate properties. A partially coupled model accurately reproduces all of the single- channel and macroscopic data. This model will provide a framework on which to organize and understand alterations in gating that occur in Shaker variants and mutants.
