Elucidating the mechanism of active transport across the membrane is relevant not only to the understanding of physiological processes but also to the rational design of drugs that modulate these processes. In the cell membrane, specialized proteins known as secondary transporters utilize the energy stored in the electrochemical gradient of ionic species across the membrane in order to carry out active transport. The leucine transporter is such a secondary transporter, with the unique distinction of being homologous to clinically relevant neurotransmitter transporters, and also similar in architecture to several other secondary transporters that are unrelated by sequence. This similarity establishes the significance of the typical “LeuT-fold” in secondary transporter function. In this study, we set forth to model and study the dynamics of LeuT in an alternative conformational state of the transport cycle, for which no crystal structure is known. A novel methodology is developed, yielding models of the inward-facing state of LeuT. We discuss several key features of this state, including structural elements and interactions that participate in the transition to this state. The study thus enhances the understanding of the transport mechanism of several families of “LeuT-fold” transporters, most including known and putative drug targets.
