Unprecedented dengue fever (DF) outbreaks impel China to develop useful disease control strategies. Integrated vector management (IVM) focuses on identifying vulnerable populations and interrupting human–vector contact; however, vulnerable populations have not been clearly identified in China. We conducted a case-control study during the initial stage of the 2014 DF outbreak in Guangzhou, China to assess risk factors for DF infection. Cases were randomly sampled from the National Notifiable Infectious Disease Reporting Information System (NNIDRIS). Controls were healthy individuals recruited from 17 DF infected communities through cluster sampling. A structured questionnaire on demographics, knowledge, practices, and living environment was administered to participants (165 cases; 492 controls). Logistic regression models identified characteristics of vulnerable populations. Awareness of dengue (OR = 0.08, 95% CI = 0.04–0.17), removing trash and stagnant water from around the residence (OR = 0.02, 95% CI = 0.00–0.17), and using mosquito repellent oils (OR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.16–0.81) were protective factors. Living in an old flat or shed (OR = 2.38, 95% CI = 1.18–4.79) was a risk factor. Coils and bed nets were not protective due to incorrect knowledge of use. Using mosquito repellent oils and other protective measures can reduce vulnerability to DF infection.
