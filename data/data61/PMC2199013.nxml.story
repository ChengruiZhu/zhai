 TCR Tg T cells. B cells which either failed to arrest in the outer PALS due to a subthreshold BCR stimulus, or arrested only transiently due to the brevity of the BCR stimulus, underwent an abortive response within the follicles when provided with T cell help. In contrast, naive B cells stimulated by a sustained, suprathreshold concentration of either foreign or self-antigen and given T cell help, proliferated in the outer PALS and then differentiated. Outer PALS arrest was not influenced by the nature of the B cells occupying the follicle, but appeared to be determined solely by the magnitude of BCR stimulation. Thus antigen-pulsed B cells arrested in the outer PALS in an identical manner irrespective of whether the follicles comprised a population of normal B cells with multiple specificities, a monoclonal naive population, or a monoclonal population of tolerant B cells. In addition, tolerant B cells were found to relocate from the follicles to the outer PALS of HEL/anti-HEL double Tg mice in which the concentration of soluble self-antigen had been increased by zinc feeding. Similarly, when anti-HEL Tg mice were crossed with a second HEL Tg strain expressing a higher concentration of soluble HEL, the tolerant anti-HEL Tg B cells were located constitutively in the outer PALS. Thus, subtle variations in antigen concentration resulted in dramatic changes in positioning of B cells within the spleen. A series of mixed bone marrow chimeras in which the effective antigen concentration was inversely related to the number of self-reactive B cells due to absorption of antigen by transgene-encoded membrane and secreted Ig, was used to confirm that alteration in B cell position previously attributed to changes in follicular composition could be explained on the basis of available antigen concentration, rather than the diversity of the repertoire.
