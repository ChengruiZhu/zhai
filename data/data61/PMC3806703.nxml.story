Consecutive acute stroke patients admitted to our stroke center and treated with t-PA between October 2005 and October 2012 were enrolled. There were 158 patients [median age, 78 (71-84) years; 84 (53%) males; median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 16 (10-20)]. Internal carotid artery occlusion was seen in 18 (72%) of the 25 patients with M1 proximal SVS, in 3 (14%) of the 22 patients with M1 distal SVS, in 4 (9%) of the 44 patients with MCA distal SVS, and in 18 (27%) of the 67 patients with No SVS (p < 0.001). Twenty-four (96%) of the 25 patients with M1 proximal SVS had no early recanalization, while 16 (73%) of the 22 patients with M1 distal SVS, 25 (57%) of the 44 patients with MCA distal SVS, and 36 (54%) of the 67 patients with No SVS had no early recanalization (p < 0.001, 0.140, and 0.846, respectively, compared to the patients with No SVS). Multivariate analysis showed that only M1 proximal SVS was significantly associated with no early recanalization (odds ratio 16.80, 95% confidence interval 2.04-138.17, p = 0.009). Among the 95 patients with a premorbid mRS score of 0-1, none (0%) of the 16 patients with M1 proximal SVS, 5 (36%) of the 14 patients with M1 distal SVS, 12 (48%) of the 25 patients with MCA distal SVS, and 13 (33%) of the 40 patients with No SVS achieved a good outcome (p = 0.011, 1.000, and 0.295, respectively, compared to the patients with No SVS).
