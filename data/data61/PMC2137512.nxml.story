 = 3.5S). The papain digests were characterized by starch gel electrophoresis and immunological methods. The highly heterogeneous fragments could be divided into two groups with distinct antigenic determinants (S and F), which were separated by DEAE ion-exchange cellulose chromatography. Approximately two-thirds of the fragments had S antigenic groupings and one-third had F antigenic groupings. These data are consistent with the view that mouse gamma globulin is split by papain and cysteine into three major fragments, two of which are of the S type and one of the F type. Antibody activity of the original molecule was present in the S fragments. Although the S fragments did not precipitate the antigen (hemocyanin) they were shown to bind antigen specifically in the manner of univalent antibodies. The S fragments of normal γ-globulin were very heterogeneous with a broad spectrum of electrophoretic mobilities. Comparison of S fragments from slow and fast migrating globulins showed that the mobilities of the original γ-globulin samples were largely reflected in the mobilities of their S fragments. Additional observations indicated that the F fragments also may help to determine the electrophoretic mobility of intact γ-globulin molecules. S fragments of differing electrophoretic mobility were shown to have the same antigenic determinants, indicating that the structural differences responsible for the electrophoretic mobility differences were not involved in the antigenic groupings identified with rabbit antisera. The F fragments of normal γ-globulin migrated more rapidly than the S fragments, were less heterogeneous, and showed several bands on starch gel electrophoresis. The F fragments differed antigenically from the S fragments, and had no antibody activity. Two groups of F fragments (F and F') were detected with some antisera. The γ-myeloma protein (5563) formed in a C
