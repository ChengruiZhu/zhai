Biological systems operate on multiple, intertwined organizational layers that can nowadays be accesses by high-throughput measurement methods, the so-called ‘omics’ technologies. A major aim in the field of systems biology is to understand the flow of biological information between the different layers at a systems level in both health and disease. To unravel the complex mechanisms underlying those molecular processes and to understand how the different functional levels interact with each other, an integrated analysis of multiple layers, i.e. a ‘multi-omics‘ approach is required. In our present study, we investigate the relationship between circulating metabolites in serum and whole-blood gene expression measured in the blood of individuals from a population-based cohort. To this end, we constructed a correlation network that displays which transcript and metabolite show the same trend of up- and down-regulation. We derived a functional characterization of the network by developing a novel computational analysis. The analysis revealed systematic signatures of signaling, transport and metabolic processes on both a regulatory and a pathway level. Moreover, integrating the network with associations to clinical markers such as HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and TG identified coordinately activated pathways or modules which might help to assess the molecular machinery behind such an intermediate phenotype.
