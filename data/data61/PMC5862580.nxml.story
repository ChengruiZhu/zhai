Tetraspanin CD151 has been identified as a tumor promoter, which is upregulated in various malignant cell types. However, the function of CD151 and its underlying mechanism in renal cell carcinoma is still unknown. In this study, we detected the expression of CD151 in RCC cells and tissues and explored its regulatory mechanism. We found that CD151 was upregulated in renal cell carcinoma tissues and cells and its expression was significantly associated with tumor stage (p=0.019) and survival (p=0.001) by analyzing tissue microarrays. After silencing of CD151 via lentivirus vector in Caki-1 and Caki-2 cells, reduced ability of migration and invasion were detected with downregulation of CD151. The opposite results were observed in cells with CD151 overexpression. Furthermore, western blotting was performed to investigate the influence of CD151 on epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, matrix metalloproteinase 9 and TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway in RCC. Subsequently, upregulating the protein level of transforming growth factor-β1 in cells with silencing of CD151 could rescue the malignant behaviors inhibited, which indicated that CD151 may play its promoting role in RCC partially by stimulating the expression of TGF-β1. Conclusively, CD151 might exhibit a prominent role in migration and invasion of RCC cells via activating TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway.
