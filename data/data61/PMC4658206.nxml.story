Synaptic plasticity is widely believed to constitute a fundamental mechanism for altering network function. An (implicit) extension of this belief is an assumption that spontaneous changes in synaptic function should not occur to any significant degree. Where excitatory synapses are concerned, recent studies have questioned the validity of this assumption. Where inhibitory synapses are concerned, however, much less is known. Here we followed the spontaneous remodeling dynamics of inhibitory synapses for days, and analyzed these dynamics within a statistical framework previously developed for glutamatergic synapses. Like their excitatory counterparts, sizes of individual synapses fluctuated considerably. Similarly, these spontaneous fluctuations were governed by a well-defined statistical process which assures that synaptic size distributions remain constant. Contrary to the aforementioned assumption, these spontaneous fluctuations drove changes in synaptic size configurations; interestingly, however, change rates were slower for inhibitory synapses. Unlike excitatory synapses, suppressing network activity barely affected inhibitory synapse remodeling dynamics, synaptic configuration change rates or synaptic size distributions. Our findings thus point to quantitative differences in spontaneous remodeling dynamics of inhibitory and excitatory synapses, but also indicate that the processes that control their sizes and govern their remodeling dynamics are fundamentally similar.
