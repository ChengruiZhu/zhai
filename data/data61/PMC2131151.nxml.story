 containing respectively the nitro or the diazo group, did not differ substantially in their serological properties (8). The antigens made from acid compounds form a group with distinctive features. In the first place the presence of acid radicals destroys the reactivity with the immune sera for the non-acid substances. This influence is so marked that even the reaction with the species specific part of the protein, if such is present, appears to be diminished. Also the sera produced with the acid antigens react but feebly with the non-acid azoproteins. Accordingly it was possible to show that by hydrolysis of the ester of an aromatic acid contained in an azoprotein the serological reactions of the antigen underwent a radical change. The presence of a free carboxyl group in the antigens not only determines the characteristics mentioned but there is reason to believe that it increases markedly the degree of specificity exhibited by the antigens and the corresponding immune sera, when cross-tests are made with a number of acid azoproteins and their antisera. This is brought out by a comparison of the results of the present investigation with those described previously (3). It is of interest in this respect that the specific carbohydrates found by Avery and Heidelberger in pneumococci and pneumobacilli are mostly, if not in all cases, compounds of distinctly acid character.
