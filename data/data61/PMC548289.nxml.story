This article traces the career of Celso-Ramon Garcia (1922–2004), noted physician, educator, and internationally renowned pioneer in the field of reproductive endocrinology. His work helped to formulate oral contraceptives used by millions of women throughout the world. Garcia's research collaborators included Gregory Pincus and John Rock, who together finalized the landmark clinical data needed to secure initial FDA approval for "the pill" in 1960. In addition to Garcia's monumental work in contraceptive endocrinology, his scholarly interests encompassed physiology of the menopause, minimally invasive reproductive surgery, as well as psychological aspects of infertility. Closely identified with the University of Pennsylvania, Garcia was instrumental in establishing the first formal clinical program in reproductive biology and influenced countless young scientists whose training he supervised and mentored. His distinguished career was emblematic of the best of the medical profession, characterized by compassion, intellect, and a sincere desire to help others. Our manuscript outlines Garcia's wide range of interests, acknowledges his superior fund of knowledge, and honors his humanitarian spirit – all of which contributed to an impressive legacy of medical discoveries. The impact of Prof. Garcia's work will continue to be felt for many years.
