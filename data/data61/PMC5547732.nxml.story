Cellular senescence is a complex biological process that leads to irreversible cell-cycle arrest. Various extrinsic and intrinsic insults are associated with the onset of cellular senescence and frequently accompany genomic or epigenomic alterations. Cellular senescence is believed to contribute to tumor suppression, immune response, and tissue repair as well as aging and age-related diseases. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are >200 nucleotides long, poorly conserved, and transcribed in a manner similar to that of mRNAs. They are tightly regulated during various cellular and physiological processes. Although many lncRNAs and their functional roles are still undescribed, the importance of lncRNAs in a variety of biological processes is widely recognized. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have a pivotal role in posttranscriptional regulation as well as in mRNA transport, storage, turnover, and translation. RBPs interact with mRNAs, other RBPs, and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) including lncRNAs, and they are involved in the regulation of a broad spectrum of cellular processes. Like other cell fate regulators, lncRNAs and RBPs, separately or cooperatively, are implicated in initiation and maintenance of cellular senescence, aging, and age-related diseases. Here, we review the current understanding of both lncRNAs and RBPs and their association with oxidative stress, senescence, and age-related diseases.
