F9 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells, cultured in suspension in medium containing 5 X 10(-8) M retinoic acid, aggregate and differentiate into embryoid bodies with an outer layer of visceral endoderm cells that synthesize and secrete alphafetoprotein (AFP) (Hogan, B. L. M., A. Taylor, and E. Adamson, 1981, Nature (Lond.). 291:235-237). Here we analyze the formation of the outer layer of cells as a model for epithelial differentiation. Three morphological phases are described, but analyses of cell numbers and the synthetic rates of some proteins, as well as the appearance of markers of visceral endoderm and basement membrane, show that the formation of the outer layer occurs as an orderly progression of multiple events. The markers used to follow the ontogeny of epithelial layer formation include SSEA-1, l, and i blood group antigens, laminin, fibronectin, type IV collagen, cytoskeletal intermediate filament proteins (vimentin, Endo A, and B), and AFP. The onset of epithelium formation occurs between the third and fourth day of culture, but its function is maximally expressed only when it is well organized. We found the rate of AFP secretion to be a measure of the proper alignment and maturity of the epithelium which occurs at the seventh or eighth day. This model of epithelium formation may help to explain how similar processes occur during embryogenesis.
