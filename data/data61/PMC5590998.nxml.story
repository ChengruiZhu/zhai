The adaptive immune system presents antigens derived from pathogenic and normal self proteins on the cell surface using human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules. The HLA loci coding for these molecules are found in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region, the most polymorphic region in the human genome, with over 15,000 HLA alleles observed so far in the world population. A high frequency of many different HLA alleles is thought be sustained by balancing selection. New HLA alleles may have an advantage over existing frequent alleles since immune escape mutations in pathogens within a population are maintained primarily in epitopes presented on frequent HLA alleles. Host immune function is not determined by single HLA alleles, but by both copies of autosomal HLA genes together (genotypes). Complementarity in function across the two potentially-variant copies of HLA at each locus can result in overdominance and heterozygote advantage at the genotype level. Less explored are selection mechanisms that may be operating across combinations of HLA alleles across loci (haplotypes). Indeed, in addition to high allelic diversity, HLA also has distinctive patterns of haplotype diversity, as certain HLA alleles co-occur in high linkage disequilibrium across five classical HLA loci (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1). We applied multiple population genetic models to a dataset of HLA haplotype frequencies derived from over six million individuals with the goal of determining what type of selection may impact HLA haplotype diversity. We found frequent haplotypes were preferentially maintained in the population across 23 US populations studied. Thus, balancing selection at the allele level and purifying selection at the haplotype level may together affect HLA diversity in human populations.
