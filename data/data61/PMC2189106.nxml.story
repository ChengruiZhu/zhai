Three new cDNA clones (designated MCSP-1, MCSP-2, and MCSP-3) encoding mouse serine proteases were isolated from cloned cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) by a modified differential screening procedure. The putative mature proteins of MCSP-2 and MCSP-3 are each composed of 228 amino acids with molecular weights of 25,477 and 25,360, respectively. NH2-terminal amino acids of MCSP-2- and MCSP-3-predicted proteins were identical to those reported for granzyme E and F, respectively. The third species, MCSP-1, was closely related to the two other cDNA species but approximately 30 amino acids equivalents of the NH2- terminal portion of the cDNA were not cloned. The amino acids forming the active sites of serine proteases were well conserved among the three predicted proteins. The active site pocket residue positioned six residues before the active-site Ser184 is alanine in MCSP-1, threonine in MCSP-2, and serine in MCSP-3, indicating that both MCSP-2 and MCSP-3 may have chymotrypsin-like specificity. There are three potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites in MCSP-1 and MCSP-3, and four in MCSP-2-deduced amino acid sequences. Amino acid comparison of MCSP-1 with four other reported serine proteases whose active site pocket residue is alanine revealed that MCSP-1 was substantially different from the other molecules, indicating that MCSP-1 may be a new member of mouse T cell serine protease family. Antibodies made against a MCSP-1 lacZ gene fusion protein stain granules of CTL and react on immunoblots with two distinct granule protein bands of 29 and 35-40 kD. Only the 35- kD species labels with [3H]DFP. Since a protease cascade may play a key role in cytolytic lymphocyte activation, our isolation of cDNAs representative of unique serine esterases should help to investigate such a cascade process.
