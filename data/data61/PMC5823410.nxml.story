A recurring problem regarding the use of conventional comb filter approaches for elimination of periodic waveforms is the degree of selectivity achieved by the filtering process. Some applications, such as the gradient artefact correction in EEG recordings during coregistered EEG-fMRI, require a highly selective comb filtering that provides effective attenuation in the stopbands and gain close to unity in the pass-bands. In this paper, we present a novel comb filtering implementation whereby the iterative filtering application of FIR moving average-based approaches is exploited in order to enhance the comb filtering selectivity. Our results indicate that the proposed approach can be used to effectively approximate the FIR moving average filter characteristics to those of an ideal filter. A cascaded implementation using the proposed approach shows to further increase the attenuation in the filter stopbands. Moreover, broadening of the bandwidth of the comb filtering stopbands around −3 dB according to the fundamental frequency of the stopband can be achieved by the novel method, which constitutes an important characteristic to account for broadening of the harmonic gradient artefact spectral lines. In parallel, the proposed filtering implementation can also be used to design a novel notch filtering approach with enhanced selectivity as well.
