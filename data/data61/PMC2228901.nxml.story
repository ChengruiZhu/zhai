We used the absorbance spectrum of 4',5'-dimethyl-5-(and 6) carboxyfluorescein to measure intracellular pH (pHi) in the isolated, perfused S3 segment of the rabbit proximal tubule. Experiments were conducted in HCO3- -free solutions. pHi recovered from an acid load imposed by an NH4+ prepulse, indicating the presence of one or more active acid-extrusion mechanisms. Removal of Na+ from bath and lumen caused pHi to decrease by approximately 0.6, whereas Na+ readdition caused complete pHi recovery. Removal of Na+ from the bath caused only a slow pHi decrease that was enhanced about fourfold when Na+ was subsequently removed from the lumen also. Similarly, the pHi recovery produced by the readdition of Na+ to the bath and lumen was about ninefold faster than when Na+ was returned to the bath only. Amiloride (1-2 mM) inhibited the pHi recovery that was elicited by returning 15 or 29 mM Na+ to lumen by only approximately 30%. However, in the absence of external acetate (Ac-), 1 mM amiloride inhibited approximately 66% of the pHi recovery induced by the readdition of 29 mM Na+ to the lumen only. The removal of external Ac- reduced the pHi recovery rate from an NH4+-induced acid load by approximately 47%, and that elicited by Na+ readdition, by approximately 67%. Finally, when bilateral removal of Na+ was maintained for several minutes, pHi recovered from the initial acidification, slowly at first, and then more rapidly, eventually reaching a pHi approximately 0.1 higher than the initial one. This Na+-independent pHi recovery was not significantly affected by lowering [HEPES]o from 32 to 3 mM or by adding N'N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (10(-4) M) to the lumen, but it was reduced approximately 57% by iodoacetate (0.5 mM) plus cyanide (1 mM). We conclude that in the nominal absence of HCO3-, three transport systems contribute to acid extrusion by S3 cells: (a) a Na+-independent mechanism, possibly an H+ pump; (b) a Na-H exchanger, confined primarily to the luminal membrane; and (c) an Ac- and luminal Na+- dependent mechanism. The contribution of these three mechanisms to total acid extrusion, assessed by the rapid readdition of Na+, was approximately 13, approximately 30, and approximately 57%, respectively.
