A total of 55,477 patients underwent a total of 62,782 arthroscopic hip procedures from 2008 through 2013. The number of cases per number of patients in the database increased every year with 15,031 total procedures in 2013 versus 3763 total procedures in 2008. Prior to changes in CPT coding, labral and/or chondral debridement represented the most commonly performed procedure. However, femoroplasty became the most common procedure in 2012 at 25% of all cases and increased to 28% of all cases by 2013. Labral repair and acetabuloplasty showed similar increases from 2011 to 2013, becoming the second and third most common procedures during that time at 21% and 17% of all procedures. Females underwent more procedures during the study period (35,088 to 20,389 for males). Patients age 40-49 were most likely to undergo any procedure, undergoing 16,373 (26%) procedures with labral or chondral debridement being the most common procedure performed (32%) followed by femoroplasty (18%). A total of 2,754 patients (10%) underwent a second arthroscopic procedure during the study period with labral or chondral debridement representing the most common secondary procedure (54%). A total of 29892 patients (5%) underwent a total hip arthroplasty following an arthroscopic procedure during the study period. Patients undergoing arthroscopic loose body removal had the highest percentage of patients eventually undergoing total hip arthroplasty (11%).
