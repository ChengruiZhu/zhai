CKLF-like MARVEL transmembrane domain-containing 5 (CMTM5) has been reported to function as a potential tumor suppressor in several human cancers. However, the involvement of CMTM5 in human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains unclear. The current study aimed to detect its expression pattern in RCC tissues and cells, and to determine its anti-proliferative functions in this malignancy. The mRNA and protein expression levels of CMTM5 in RCC tissues and cells were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Following the transfection with CMTM5 lentivirus or control lenti-EGFP lentivirus into the RCC cell line ACHN, the viability, migration, apoptosis and cell cycle of these cells were detected by Cell Counting kit-8 assay, Transwell assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Compared with the adjacent non-malignant kidney tissue samples, CMTM5 expression was significantly downregulated in RCC tissues (P<0.05). In addition, enforced expression of CMTM5 could efficiently inhibit the cell growth of ACHN cells, which were arrested in G0/G1 phase. Furthermore, the migration and invasion of ACHN cells were also inhibited by restoration of CMTM5 expression. The present data suggest that CMTM5 may function as a tumor suppressor in human RCC by suppressing the viability of RCC cells, implying its potential as a therapeutic target for this malignancy.
