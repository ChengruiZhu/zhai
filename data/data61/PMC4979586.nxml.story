A total of 599 Femilis LNG-IUS were inserted in various clinical trials, the majority for contraceptive purposes. The total exposure in the first and second contraceptive studies, covering 558 parous and nulliparous women, was 32,717 woman-months. Femilis has high contraceptive effectiveness as only one pregnancy occurred. Expulsion of the LNG-IUS was rare with only two total and no partial expulsions (stem protruding through the cervical canal) occurred. Femilis was well tolerated, with continuation rates remaining high. Several MBL studies were conducted, totaling 80 heavy and normal menstrual bleeders, using the pictorial bleeding assessment chart method or the quantitative alkaline hematin technique. Virtually all women responded well with strongly reduced menstrual bleeding. Amenorrhea rates were high, up to 80% after three months, and ferritin levels simultaneously increased significantly. The Femilis LNG-IUS was tested in 104 symptomatic perimenopausal women for seamless transition to and through menopause, adding estrogen therapy when required. Patient tolerability appeared high as >80% requested a second and a third LNG-IUS. Twenty women presenting with nonatypical and atypical hyperplasia and one woman presenting with early endometrial carcinoma were treated with Femilis LNG-IUS. All histology specimens showed full regression, and patients remained in remission without signs of hyperplasia or cancer at yearly and ongoing follow-up examinations up to 10 years. Residual content of LNG was measured in 37 women having the Femilis LNG-IUS for up to 10 years. In 10 of the 102 women who had the Femilis 60 in situ for 10 years between 20% and 30% of the original 60 mg was recovered confirming the long duration of action of the Femilis 60 LNG-IUS.
