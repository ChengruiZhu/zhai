Metastasis is the primary cause of mortality in patients with advanced gastric carcinoma, and multiple signaling pathways promote the development of this condition. Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1Î±/CXCL12), the main ligand for CXC chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4), serves an important role in gastric cancer cell migration. Previous studies have demonstrated that CXCL12 could also stimulate the secretion of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands, including amphiregulin and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor, from gastric cancer cells, resulting in an increase in the ability of migration. However, it remains to be elucidated whether CXCL12 activates EGFR intracellular signaling and therefore stimulates migration in gastric cancer. The present study demonstrated that three gastric cancer cell lines, SGC-7901, MGC-803 and BGC-823, all expressed CXCR4. The increased chemotactic migratory ability stimulated by CXCL12 was effectively abrogated by the CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100. Furthermore, a rapid phosphorylation of Akt/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/EGFR was demonstrated to be involved in CXCL12/CXCR4-induced gastric cancer cell migration. Knockdown of EGFR gene or the use of a monoclonal antibody against EGFR (C225) blocked the activation of ERK/Akt and partially prevented the ability of migration induced by CXCL12, which indicated that EGFR signaling is located downstream of CXCL12. In addition, it was also revealed that the activation of non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-steroid receptor co-activator (SRC) and the formation of the SRC/EGFR heterodimer are promoted by CXCL12, whereas the SRC inhibitor, PP2, blocks the SRC/EGFR heterodimer and the activation of EGFR, as well as CXCR4-meditated migration induced by CXCL12. The present results indicated that SRC mediates a potential CXCR4-EGFR cross-talk, and thereby utilizes the EGFR-Akt/ERK axis to promote cellular migration. The present study provided a novel insight into the underlying regulatory mechanisms of the CXCL12/CXCR4 pathway in gastric cancer cell migration.
