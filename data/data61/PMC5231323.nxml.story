We are remarkably adept at inferring the consequences of our actions, even in novel situations. However, the neuronal mechanisms that allow us to plan a sequence of novel choices remain a mystery. One hypothesis is that anterior prefrontal brain regions can jump ahead from an initial decision to evaluate subsequent choices. Here, we examine how the brain represents initial versus subsequent choices of varying difficulty during spatial planning in novel environments. Specifically, participants visually searched for the shortest path to a goal in pictures of novel mazes that contained one or two path junctions. We monitored the participantsâ€™ brain activity during the task with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We observed, in the anterior prefrontal brain, two distinct responses to demanding choices at the second junction: one in the rostrodorsal medial prefrontal cortex (rd-mPFC), which also signalled less demanding initial choices, and another one in the lateral frontopolar cortex (lFPC), which was only engaged by demanding choices at the second junction. Notably, interactions of the rd-mPFC with the hippocampus, a region associated with memory, increased when planning required extensive deliberation and particularly when planning led to accurate choices. Our findings show how humans can rapidly formulate a plan in novel environments. More broadly, these data uncover potential neural mechanisms underlying how we make inferences about states beyond a current subjective state.
