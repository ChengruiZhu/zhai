Periostin (POSTN, PN, or osteoblast-specific factor OSF-2) is a multifunctional cytokine that signals between the cell and the extracellular matrix. Periostin plays an important role in tumor development and is involved in carcinoma cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), whereby mature epithelial cells undergo phenotypic morphological changes and become invasive, motile cells. Here, we discuss the molecular mechanisms involved in periostin-induced promotion of EMT in lung cancer cells. Online TCGA datasets demonstrate the prognostic relevance of periostin in lung cancer; a higher periostin level correlates with poor overall survival. Similarly, our IHC results show that high periostin expression is positively correlated with the EMT markers Snail and Twist, as well as stage of lung cancer. We found that recombinant periostin induces the EMT phenotype in lung cancer cells through the p38/ERK pathway, while pretreatment with chemical inhibitors prevented periostin-induced EMT induction. Moreover, we found that periostin regulates EMT by repressing microRNA-381 (miR-381) expression, which targets both Snail and Twist. Using the miR-381 mimic, we dramatically reversed periostin-induced Snail and Twist expression. Furthermore, periostin knockdown dramatically affected EMT markers and cell migration potential. The role of periostin in lung cancer progression is elucidated by the
