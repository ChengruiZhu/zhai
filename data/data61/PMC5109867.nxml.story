Interdental papilla construction, especially in the esthetic area, is one of the most challenging tasks. Interdental papilla loss might occur due to several reasons as a consequence of periodontal surgery or trauma. The purpose of this study is to report the reconstruction of lost interdental papilla using hyaluronic acid gel. Hyaluronic acid is a glycosaminoglycan molecule with anti-inflammatory, anti-edematous properties on periodontal tissues invaded by submicrobial flora. It enhances wound healing and accelerates periodontal repair and regeneration. In addition to the field of dentistry, it has been used in other fields such as orthopedics, ophthalmology, and dermatology. It shows growth factor interaction, regulates osmotic pressure, and enhances tissue lubrication, which helps in maintaining the structural and homeostatic integrity of tissues, hence resulting in beneficial effect on lost interdental papilla. This study was aimed to reconstruct the lost interdental papilla by injecting 0.2% hyaluronic acid via nonsurgical approach. It is a noninvasive approach which reduces patient's postoperative discomfort with marked variations in the volume of interdental papilla before and after the procedure. As sufficient information is not available regarding the effectiveness of hyaluronic acid in interdental papilla construction, this study was conducted.
