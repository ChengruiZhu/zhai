Our previous study showed that angiotensin II (Ang II) exposure diminished the interaction between nephrin and c-Abl, then c-Abl mediated SHIP2-Akt pathway in the process of podocyte injury in vivo and vitro. However, the relationship between nephrin and c-Abl was unknown. Recently, various studies showed that nephrin was required for cytoskeletal remodeling in glomerular podocytes. But its specific mechanisms remain incompletely understood. As a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase involved in cytoskeletal regulation, c-Abl may be a candidate of signaling proteins interacting with Src homology 2/3 (SH2/SH3) domains of nephrin. Therefore, it is proposed that c-Abl contributes to nephrin-dependent cytoskeletal remodeling of podocytes. Herein, we observed that nephrin-c-Abl colocalization were suppressed in glomeruli of patients with proteinuria. Next, CD16/7-nephrin and c-Abl vectors were constructed to investigate the nephrin-c-Abl signaling pathway in podocyte actin-cytoskeletal remodeling. The disorganized cytoskeleton stimulated by cytochalasin D in COS7 cells was dramatically restored by co-transfection with phosphorylated CD16/7-nephrin and c-Abl full-length constructs. Further, co-immunoprecipitation showed that phosphorylated CD16/7-nephrin interacted with wild-type c-Abl, but not with SH2/SH3-defective c-Abl. These findings suggest that phosphorylated nephrin is able to recruit c-Abl in a SH2/SH3-dependent manner and detached c-Abl from dephosphorylated nephrin contributes to cytoskeletal remodeling in podocytes.
