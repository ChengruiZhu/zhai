Cystitis glandularis (CG) has been hypothesized as a potential precursor of adenocarcinoma, although this remains controversial. The present study reports data accumulated from 166 cases of cystitis glandularis with follow-up periods ranging between 0.5 and 17 years. The association between intestinal and typical CG and bladder carcinoma was retrospectively evaluated. The patients included in the present study had presented with typical (n=155) or intestinal (n=11) CG between 1994 and 2010. Of those patients, concurrent carcinoma of the bladder was identified in 15 (9.0%) patients, including two cases of squamous cell carcinoma and 1 case of sarcoma. The cases of carcinoma were identified either prior to or concurrently with the diagnosis of CG. Follow-up was available for 9/11 (81.8%) patients with intestinal CG. Nine months following transurethral fulguration, 8/11 (72.7%) patients were in complete remission and 1/11 (9.1%) complained of urgency and dysuria; two patients were lost to follow-up. The follow-up of the patients ranged from 0.7 to 4.5 years (median, 2.67 years; mean, 2.82 years). No evidence of subsequent carcinoma was identified in any of the patients during the follow-up of the intestinal and typical CG groups. In addition, there was no evidence of carcinoma subsequent to CG in either of the typical or intestinal CG groups. The results did not support that CG increases the future risk of malignancy in the short term and repeated cystoscopies over a short period of time are not recommended.
