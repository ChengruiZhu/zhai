Although rare, a recessive temperature-sensitive calmodulin mutant has been isolated in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The mutant carries two mutations in CMD1, isoleucine 100 is changed to asparagine and glutamic acid 104 is changed to valine. Neither mutation alone conferred temperature sensitivity. A single mutation that allowed production of an intact but defective protein was not identified. At the nonpermissive temperature, the temperature-sensitive mutant displayed multiple defects. Bud formation and growth was delayed, but this defect was not responsible for the temperature-sensitive lethality. Cells synchronized in G1 progressed through the cell cycle and retained viability until the movement of the nucleus to the neck between the mother cell and the large bud. After nuclear movement, less than 5% of the cells survived the first mitosis and could form colonies when returned to permissive conditions. The duplicated DNA was dispersed along the spindle, extending from mother to daughter cell. Cells synchronized in G2/M lost viability immediately upon the shift to the nonpermissive temperature. At a semipermissive temperature, the mutant showed approximately a 10-fold increase in the rate of chromosome loss compared to a wild-type strain. The mitotic phenotype is very similar to yeast mutants that are defective in chromosome disjunction. The mutant also showed defects in cytokinesis.
