The human genome contains numerous DNA trinucleotide repeats, which mutate infrequently in most situations. However, in families affected by certain inherited neurological diseases such as Huntington's, a trinucleotide repeat has undergone an expansion mutation that lengthens the repeat tract. This expansion is generally sufficient to cause disease. Further germline and somatic expansions in affected families occur at very high frequencies—approaching 100% in some cases—suggesting that mutation of the trinucleotide repeat becomes the norm rather than the exception, while the rest of the genome remains genetically stable. These observations indicate that trinucleotide repeat expansions are localized in the genome and occur by novel mutational mechanisms. We searched for proteins that favor expansions and identified specific histone deacetylase complexes (HDACs)—comprising enzymes that remove acetyl groups from histones—in budding yeast and in human astrocytes. Interfering with these HDACs by mutation, RNA interference, or small molecule inhibitors blocked 50%–90% of expansion events. We also found that yeast HDACs promote expansions via a downstream deacetylation target, the nuclease Sae2. These results indicate that HDACs promote trinucleotide repeat expansions by modulating key proteins, which in turn catalyze the expansion. We postulate that HDAC inhibitors, currently being tested for relief of the transcription-related consequences of expansions, may have the beneficial side effect of reducing the risk of further somatic expansion.
