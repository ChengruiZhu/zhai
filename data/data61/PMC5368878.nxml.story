Hemangiomas are benign tumors originating in the vascular tissues of skin, mucosa, muscles, glands, and bones. Although these tumors are common lesions of the head and neck, they rarely occur in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. Cavernous haemangioma of the lateral wall of the nasopharynx has not previously been reported. We examined the clinical, radiological and therapeutic management of cavernous haemangioma of nasopharynx starting from a clinical case of a 26-year-old woman with a history of recurrent and conspicuous epistaxis and left-sided nasal associated severe obstruction. Nasopharynx examination, by flexible endoscopy, showed a cystic mass borne by the left side wall of the nasopharynx, in contact with the soft palate, covered by intact and regular mucosa. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan, confirmed these findings and showed contextual lamellar calcifications and inhomogeneous enhancement. The nasal endoscopic approach (FESS), under general anesthesia, allowed removal of the mass, without complications, after careful hemostasis of arterial branches. It was possible to establish the precise site of origin of the tumor only during the surgical procedure. Histopathological study showed mucosa with extensive vascular proliferation, with framework of lacunar/cavernous haemangioma, also present at lamellar bone tissue level. An unusual site and an unspecific clinical appearance can make diagnosis and treatment of a cavernous hemangioma of the nasopharynx difficult. The nasal endoscopic technique proved to be reliable in terms of adequate exposure and visualization of the lesion, control of bleeding, and complete removal of the mass.
