Both within the visual system and more generally, two general processes describe nervous system development: first, genetically determined cues provide a coarse layout of cells and connections and second, neuronal activity removes unwanted cells and refines connections. This activity occurs not just through external stimulation, but also through correlated, spontaneously generated bursts of action potentials occurring in hyper-excitable regions of the developing nervous system prior to external stimulation. Spontaneous activity has been implicated in the maturation of many neural circuits, however exactly which features are important for this purpose is largely unknown. In order to help address this question we construct a mathematical model to understand the spatiotemporal patterns of spontaneously driven activity in the developing retina. This activity is known as retinal waves. We describe a simplified, biophysically consistent, reaction-diffusion model of cholinergic retinal waves capable of recapitulating wave dynamics observed in mice retina recordings. This novel reaction-diffusion formulation allows us to connect wave features to underlying physiological parameters. In particular this approach is used to determine which features of the system are responsible for wave propagation and for the spatiotemporal patterns of propagating waves observed in both mice and other species.
