The activity of proteins can be finely and reversibly tuned by post-translational modifications. The attachment of phosphate groups to tyrosine residues is one of such modifications. While the existence of extracellular phosphoproteins has been known, the functional significance of extracellular phosphorylation is poorly understood. Here we describe a single extracellular tyrosine whose inducible phosphorylation may represent an archetype for a new class of mechanism mediating protein—protein interaction and regulating protein function. We show that the interaction between EphB2—which occurs upon receptor activation by its ligand ephrin-B—and the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) depends on extracellular phosphorylation of EphB2. This interaction regulates the localization of the NMDA receptor to synaptic sites in neurons. In vivo, EphB2 is phosphorylated in response to injury, and the subsequent up-regulation of the interaction between EphB2 and NMDA receptors enhances injury-induced pain behavior and mechanical hypersensitivity in mice. Importantly, our study defines a specific extracellular phosphorylation event as a mechanism driving protein interaction and suggests that extracellular phosphorylation of proteins is an underappreciated mechanism contributing to the development and function of the nervous system and synapse.
