In recent reports we have described the generation of natural killer (NK) lines devoid of CD3/TCR structures but with apparent specificity for allogeneic target cells. Using one such NK line as an immunogen, we now report the generation of two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), designated 2-13 and 5-38, which bind selectively to the majority of CD3- , CD16+, CD56+ lymphocytes and inhibit the lysis of specific allogeneic target cells by a panel of alloreactive NK lines. By contrast, these mAbs had no effect on classical NK cell mediated lysis of K562 cells or major histocompatibility-restricted T cell-mediated cytolysis. Immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled NK lines followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that the target molecules of both mAbs have a molecular mass of approximately 180 kD. Leu 19, a well-described anti-CD56 mAb, precipitated a 180 kD protein from NK cells, and the binding of Leu 19 to NK cells was blocked by pretreatment with both 2-13 and 5-38. However, in contrast to these mAbs, Leu 19 had no effect on the cytolytic activity of allospecific NK cells. Sequential immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that all three mAbs recognized distinct molecular species of CD56. We interpret these findings as indicating that multiple isoforms of CD56 are differentially expressed on NK lines and play critical roles in the recognition/interaction of these cells with their specific allogeneic targets.
