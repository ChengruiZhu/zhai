It is well established that active sodium-ion transport and water flow across isolated toad bladder are increased by antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and by cAMP. These agents were also observed in previous studies to cause changes in the amount of radioactive phosphate in a specific protein in the toad bladder. This protein, found by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of toad bladder epithelial preparations, had an apparent molecular weight of 49,000 daltons. In the present study, a correlation was found between the ability of a variety of substances to affect the amount of radioactive phosphate in this 40,000-dalton protein and their ability to alter the rate of sodium transport. Thus several agents (ADH, cAMP, theophylline, adenine, prostaglandin E1, and Mn Cl-2) caused a decrease in the amount of radioactive phosphate in the 49,000-dalton protein and also stimulated active sodium transport across the bladder. Conversely, ZnCl-2 produced an increase in the amount of radioactive phosphate in this protein and an inhibition of sodium transport. With each of these agents, the time-course of change in phosphorylation of this protein was, in general, similar to that for sodium transport. A second phosphoprotein, with an apparent molecular weight of about 42,000 daltons, showed changes in parallel with, but less extensive than, those observed in the 49,000 dalton protein. There was no consistent relationship between changes in level of phosphorylation of either in the 49,000- or 42,000- dalton protein and changes in osmotic water permeability. The results are compatible with the possibility that regulation by ADH and by cAMP of sodium transport in the toad bladder epithelium may be mediated through regulation of the amount of phosphate in a specific protein.
