Rod cyclic nucleotide–gated (CNG) channels are modulated by changes in tyrosine phosphorylation catalyzed by protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and phosphatases (PTPs). We used genistein, a PTK inhibitor, to probe the interaction between the channel and PTKs. Previously, we found that in addition to inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation of the rod CNG channel α-subunit (RETα), genistein triggers a noncatalytic inhibitory interaction between the PTK and the channel. These studies suggest that PTKs affects RETα channels in two ways: (1) by catalyzing phosphorylation of the channel protein, and (2) by allosterically regulating channel activation. Here, we study the mechanism of noncatalytic inhibition. We find that noncatalytic inhibition follows the same activity dependence pattern as catalytic modulation (phosphorylation): the efficacy and apparent affinity of genistein inhibition are much higher for closed than for fully activated channels. Association rates with the genistein–PTK complex were similar for closed and fully activated channels and independent of genistein concentration. Dissociation rates were 100 times slower for closed channels, which is consistent with a much higher affinity for genistein–PTK. Genistein–PTK affects channel gating, but not single channel conductance or the number of active channels. By analyzing single channel gating during genistein–PTK dissociation, we determined the maximal open probability for normal and genistein–PTK-bound channels. genistein–PTK decreases open probability by increasing the free energy required for opening, making opening dramatically less favorable.
