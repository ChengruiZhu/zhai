This paper describes the effect of external chloride on the typical swelling response induced in duck red cells by hypertonicity or norepinephrine. Lowering chloride inhibits swelling and produces concomitant changes in net movements of sodium and potassium in ouabain-treated cells, which resemble the effect of lowering external sodium or potassium. Inhibition is the same whether chloride is replaced with gluconate or with an osmotic equivalent of sucrose. Since changes in external chloride also cause predictable changes in cell chloride, pH, and water, these variables were systematically investigated by varying external pH along with chloride. Lowering pH to 6.60 does not abolish the response if external chloride levels are normal, although the cells are initially swollen due to the increased acidity. Cells deliberately preswollen in hypotonic solutions with appropriate ionic composition can also respond to norepinephrine by further swelling. These results rule out initial values of cell water, chloride, and pH as significant variables affecting the response. Initial values of the chloride equilibrium potential do have marked effect on the direction and rate of net water movement. If chloride is lowered by replacement with the permeant anion, acetate, E(Cl) is unchanged and a normal response to norepinephrine, which is inhibited by furosemide, is observed. Increasing internal sodium by the nystatin technique also inhibits the response. A theory is developed which depicts that the cotransport carrier proposed in the previous paper (W.F. Schmidt and T.J. McManus. 1977b. J. Gen. Physiol. 70:81-97) moves in response to the net electrochemical potential difference driving sodium and potassium across the membrane. Predictions of this theory fit the data for both cations and anions.
