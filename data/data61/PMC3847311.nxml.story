In a previous study, we elucidated the specific microRNA (miRNA) profile of hepatic differentiation. In this study, we aimed to clarify the instructive role of six overexpressed miRNAs (miR-1246, miR-1290, miR-148a, miR-30a, miR-424 and miR-542-5p) during hepatic differentiation of human umbilical cord lining-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and to test whether overexpression of any of these miRNAs is sufficient to induce differentiation of the hMSCs into hepatocyte-like cells. Before hepatic differentiation, hMSCs were infected with a lentivirus containing a miRNA inhibitor sequence. We found that downregulation of any one of the six hepatic differentiation-specific miRNAs can inhibit HGF-induced hepatic differentiation including albumin expression and LDL uptake. Although overexpression of any one of the six miRNAs alone or liver-enriched miR-122 cannot initiate hepatic differentiation, ectopic overexpression of seven miRNAs (miR-1246, miR-1290, miR-148a, miR-30a, miR-424, miR-542-5p and miR-122) together can stimulate hMSC conversion into functionally mature induced hepatocytes (iHep). Additionally, after transplantation of the iHep cells into mice with CCL4-induced liver injury, we found that iHep not only can improve liver function but it also can restore injured livers. The findings from this study indicate that miRNAs have the capability of directly converting hMSCs to a hepatocyte phenotype
