 as well as easy genetic modification. We here use this system to analyze the role of the poorly characterized anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma protein 2 (Bcl-2) family member A1/Bfl-1 (Bcl-2-related protein A1) for survival and homeostasis of neutrophils and of neutrophil progenitors. Low constitutive mRNA and protein expression of A1 was detected, while A1 was transiently upregulated early during differentiation. Pro-inflammatory stimuli caused strong, mainly transcriptional, A1 upregulation, in contrast to posttranscriptional regulation of Mcl-1 (induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein). Inhibitor studies showed that phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt and Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) is required for A1 expression and survival of progenitors and mature neutrophils. ShRNA-mediated constitutive A1 knockdown (KD) impaired maintenance of progenitors. ShRNA experiments further showed that A1 was required early during neutrophil differentiation as well as in mature neutrophils upon pro-inflammatory stimulation. Our data further indicate differential regulation of the two anti-apoptotic proteins A1 and Mcl-1. Relevant findings were confirmed in primary human neutrophils. Our data indicate that A1, in addition to the well-established Mcl-1, substantially contributes to neutrophil survival and homeostasis. A1 may thus be a promising target for anti-inflammatory therapy.
