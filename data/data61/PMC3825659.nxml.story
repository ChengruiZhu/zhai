Lysosomes are organelles that work as a disposal system for the cell. It is known that lysosomes can degrade glycogen and that defects in this function trigger the accumulation of vesicles containing glycogen in animals that lead to vacuolar myopathies—diseases that result in muscle weakness. However, it remains unclear how and why glycogen is degraded through this system, and what significance it has for the pathology of such diseases. Here, we addressed these questions by establishing a fruitfly model system to study glycogen autophagy in skeletal muscles. By feeding the flies chloroquine (CQ), we induce a vacuolar myopathy associated with massive accumulation of glycogen-filled vesicles, and assay the role of autophagy and glycogen metabolic enzymes in this process. We show that CQ-induced glycogen autophagy is completely dependent on the core conserved autophagy genes and that this autophagy is triggered by nutrient deprivation in a Tor-dependent manner. Interestingly, while glycogen autophagy and enzymatic glycogen breakdown can compensate for each other, concurrent inhibition of both systems blocks glycogen breakdown. Finally, we show that CQ-induced myopathy can be improved by reduction of either autophagy or glycogen synthesis, the latter possibly due to a direct role of glycogen synthase—the main enzyme involved in converting glucose to glycogen—in regulating autophagy through its interaction with the autophagosome.
