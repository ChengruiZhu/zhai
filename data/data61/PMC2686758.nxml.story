The biological activity of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF, CCN2) is regulated at the level of intracellular signaling leading to gene expression, and by its extracellular interaction partners which determine the functional outcome of CCN2 action. In this overview, we summarize the data which provide evidence that one of the major signaling pathways, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)–AKT signaling, shows a remarkable cell type-dependence in terms of regulation of CCN2 expression. In smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells, inhibition of this pathway either reduced CCN2 expression or was not involved in CCN2 gene expression depending on the stimulus used. In microvascular endothelial cells by contrast, activation of PI3K–AKT signaling was inversely related to CCN2 expression. Upregulation of CCN2 upon inhibition of PI3K–AKT was also observed in primary cultures of human endothelial cells (HUVEC) exposed to laminar flow in an in vitro flow-through system. In different types of endothelial cells, FoxO transcription factors, which are negatively regulated by AKT, were identified as potent activators of CCN2 gene expression. In HUVEC, we observed a correlation between enhanced nuclear localization of FoxO1 and increased synthesis of CCN2 protein in areas of non-uniform shear stress. These data indicate that FoxO proteins are key regulators of CCN2 gene expression which determine the effect of PI3K–AKT activation in terms of CCN2 regulation.
