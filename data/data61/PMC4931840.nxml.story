Patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) experience progressive deterioration of functional capacity and quality of life (QoL). This prospective, randomized, controlled trial assesses the effect of exercise training (ET) protocol on functional capacity, rehospitalization, and QoL in CHF patients older than 70 years compared with a control group. A total of 343 elderly patients with stable CHF (age, 76.90±5.67, men, 195, 56.9%) were randomized to ET (TCG, n=170) or usual care (UCG, n=173). The ET protocol involved supervised training sessions for 3 months in the hospital followed by home-telemonitored sessions for 3 months. Assessments, performed at baseline and at 3 and 6 months, included: ECG, resting echocardiography, NT-proBNP, 6-minute walk test (6MWT), Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, and comprehensive geriatric assessment with the InterRAI-HC instrument. As compared to UCG, ET patients at 6 months showed: i) significantly increased 6MWT distance (450±83 vs. 290±97 m, p<0.001); ii) increased ADL scores (5.00±2.49 vs. 6.94±5.66, p=0.037); iii) 40% reduced risk of rehospitalisation (hazard ratio=0.558, 95%CI, 0.326-0.954, p=0.033); and iv) significantly improved perceived QoL (28.6±12.3 vs. 44.5±12.3, p<0.001). In hospital and home-based telemonitored exercise confer significant benefits on the oldest CHF patients, improving functional capacity and subjective QoL and reducing risk of rehospitalisation.
