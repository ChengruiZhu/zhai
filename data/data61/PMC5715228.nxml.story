Total scapulectomy and reconstruction has been performed for scapular tumor, however, most of the reconstruction methods have resulted in poor functional outcomes and there is still room for improvement. Most of the reports of reconstruction after scapulectomy are from a single institution. In the present study, we investigated functional outcomes after total scapulectomy in a multicenter study in The Eastern Asian Musculoskeletal Oncology Group (EAMOG). Thirty-three patients who underwent total scapulectomy were registered at EAMOG affiliated hospitals. The patients were separated into no reconstruction group (n=8), humeral suspension group (n=15) and prosthesis group (n=10). Functional outcome was assessed by the Enneking score. One-way ANOVA was used to compare parameters between the patient groups. Complications included five local recurrences, one superficial infection, one dislocation and one clavicle protrusion. The average follow-up period was 43.5  months. The average active flexion range was 45.8° (0–120°), and 37.1° in abduction (0–120°). The mean total functional score was 22.9 out of 30 (15–29), which is a satisfactory score following resection of the shoulder girdle. There were significant differences in reconstruction methods for active range of motion. Bony reconstruction provided better range of motion in this study. There was a variety of reconstruction methods after scapulectomy in the eastern Asian countries. Although better functional score was obtained using scapular prosthesis or recycled bone and prosthesis composite grafting, postoperative function is still lower than preoperative function. Modified designed prosthesis with or without combination of recycle bone or allograft would restore the lost shoulder function in the future.
