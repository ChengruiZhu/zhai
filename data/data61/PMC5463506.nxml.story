Cancer of the nasopharynx displays an unparalleled skewness of its epidemiologic, pathogenic and clinico-prognostic characteristics depending on the geographic location. Between the endemic and sporadic forms, which occur in Southeastern Asia and Northern America, respectively, intermediate incidence is noted around the Mediterranean. This study describes the patterns of the disease affecting the population of Western Greece. The records of 70 patients with nasopharyngeal cancer diagnosed in a single institution between 1994-2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Primary treatment involved irradiation with or without concurrent chemotherapy. Demographic data, patient risk factors, tumour parameters, clinical presentation and treatment outcomes were assessed for potential intercorrelations. Overall (OS) and disease-specific (DSS) 5-year survival rates were determined. Possible predictors of survival were tested on univariate and multivariate analysis. WHO-type 3 histopathology was diagnosed predominantly (74.3%) and associated significantly with nasal symptomatology upon presentation (p = 0.050), metastatic lymphadenopathy (p = 0.028), advanced clinical stage (p = 0.009) and complete response to initial treatment (p = 0.018). Univariate analysis revealed a negative prognostic significance for older age (OS, p = 0.029 DSS, p = 0.041), poor response to treatment (OS & DSS p < 0.001) and cancer recurrence (OS, p = 0.003 DSS, p = 0.001). On multivariate analysis, disease relapse maintained its adverse effect (HR 7.442, 95% CI 2.199-25.187, p = 0.001). In conclusion, among nasopharyngeal carcinomas arising in western Greece, lymphoepitheliomas manifest a distinct clinical behaviour, so that their latest grouping along with WHO-type 2 tumours into the "non-keratinising" category may not apply. Regardless of pathology, cancer recurrence after initial remission is a severe event.
