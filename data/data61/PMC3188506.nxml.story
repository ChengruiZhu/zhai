Despite recent progress in computational and experimental studies of dynamic regulation in protein kinases, a mechanistic understanding of long-range communication and mechanisms of mutation-induced signaling controlling kinase activity remains largely qualitative. In this study, we have performed a systematic modeling and analysis of allosteric activation in ABL and EGFR kinases at the increasing level of complexity - from catalytic domain to multi-domain regulatory complexes. The results of this study have revealed organizing structural and mechanistic principles of allosteric signaling in protein kinases. Although activation mechanisms in ABL and EGFR kinases have evolved through acquisition of structurally different regulatory complexes, we have found that long-range interdomain communication between common functional segments (αF-helix and αC-helix) may be important for allosteric activation. The results of study have revealed molecular signatures of activating cancer mutations and have shed the light on general mechanistic aspects of mutation-induced signaling in protein kinases. An advanced understanding and further characterization of molecular signatures of kinase mutations may aid in a better rationalization of mutational effects on clinical outcomes and facilitate molecular-based therapeutic strategies to combat kinase mutation-dependent tumorigenesis.
