In any population, two factors determine whether the average fitness of individuals will increase (adaptation) or decrease: the size of the population and the distribution of mutational effects (i.e., the relative rates and effect sizes of beneficial and deleterious mutations). Although it is relatively simple to get quantitative information on population size, it is much harder to gain insight into the distribution of mutational effects. Very little information exists on the relative rates of beneficial versus deleterious effects, on the shapes of mutational distributions, or on whether the distributions change over time. Thus, it remains difficult to even speculate whether a given population will adapt over time. Here, we use laboratory evolution of a bacterial virus to quantify the distribution of mutational effects. Our results reveal that the average impact of a mutation is approximately constant with respect to fitness, that most mutations have small effects, and that the rate of beneficial mutation depends on the fitness of the organism. Our study demonstrates the simple, but perhaps underappreciated fact that mutational effects are dynamic. It also proposes and tests an explicit model of adaptation in which organismal fitness specifies both the rate and distribution of deleterious and beneficial mutations, and it presents specific and testable predictions of the circumstances under which populations will adapt.
