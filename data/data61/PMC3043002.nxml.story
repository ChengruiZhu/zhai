During embryonic development, growing axons establish intricate neural networks with their peripheral targets, a process that builds the basis for complex behaviors. While wiring up the proper circuits in peripheral limbs, for example, motor axons from the spinal cord and sensory axons from the dorsal root ganglia converge in the spinal nerve. Here, they intermingle and are subsequently sorted before reaching the plexus region, the pivotal dorsal-ventral choice point on their path to the limb. In this study, we analyzed the contribution of the axon guidance receptor Neuropilin-1 (Npn-1) to determine how axons choose their path, how well they are able to maintain their correct path, and how it influences the interactions between spinal sensory axons and motor axons. We find that when Npn-1 is eliminated from sensory neurons, both sensory and motor axons are “derailed” from their correct nerve bundles, and there is a break in the tight coupling between these axonal populations. Loss of Npn-1 in motoneurons, however, leads to impairments in axon bundling and pathfinding errors only in motor axons, while sensory axons remain unaffected. Genetic ablation studies of either sensory or motor neurons corroborate the results on the mutual dependency and specificity of the outgrowing spinal projections. These results reveal a role for Npn-1 in controlling specific axon-axon interactions that lead to formation of proper spinal sensory-motor trajectories to the limb. Furthermore, they suggest that the presence of minimal numbers of sensory or motor axons is sufficient for the formation of correct spinal projections.
