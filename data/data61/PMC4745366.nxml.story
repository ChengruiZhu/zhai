Nutrigenomics is an emerging science which investigates a certain area of nutrition that uses molecular tools to search access and understand the several responses obtained through a certain diet applied between individual and population groups. The increased need for the use of personalised nutrition in patients is increasing and research is being made on its possible effects. However, research on nutrigenomics and in particular, obesity is still ongoing. Following a current metanalysis on thirty-eight nutrigenomics genes, it seems that a definite association between the genes usually examined in nutrigenomics testing and several diet-related diseases is lacking, even though there is a limited number of studies associating them. In 2014, literature search results in a great number of studies on several polymorphisms. This heterogeneity could only show the way towards new research aims. Nutrigenomics was born due to the need to move from Epidemiology and Physiology to Molecular Biology and Genetics. Currently, there are steps that need to be considered in order for nutrigenomics to be applied: the genes, the gene/protein network, and the strategy towards the determination of the nutrients' influence on gene/protein expression. It is certainly an interesting evolving science with many areas to be investigated further and from different perspectives, as it involves ethics, medicine, genetics and nutrition.
