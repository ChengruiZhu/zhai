The PC12 line of nerve growth factor (NGF)-responsive rat pheochromocytoma cells was used as a model system to determine whether properties of microtubules change during neurite growth and maturation. In the absence of NGF, PC12 cells lack processes. After several days with NGF, PC12 cells begin extending neurites and, by 2-3 wk with NGF, PC12 cells have long (approximately 1 mm), highly branched neurites. We examined the effect of colchicine on microtubules of PC12 cells grown without NGF or with NGF for 1 or 21 d. PC12 cells grown under the various conditions were exposed to 50 microM colchicine for 1 or 6 h, and were then assayed for their content of polymerized tubulin using a biochemical assay. Microtubule levels in drug-treated cultures were compared to those in non-drug-treated control sister cultures. PC12 cells grown without NGF or with NGF for 1 d were depleted of MT by 1 h with colchicine. In contrast, microtubule levels in long-term NGF- treated cells exposed to colchicine for 6 h were reduced to only approximately 57% of those in control cells. Control experiments indicated that the observed differential susceptibility to colchicine was not due to differences in colchicine uptake or to the effects of colchicine on cell viability. These observations suggest that microtubules of PC12 cells grown without NGF or with NGF for 21 d differ in their properties. Such differences may be related to one or more of the changes in structure and/or motility that result from treatment with NGF.
