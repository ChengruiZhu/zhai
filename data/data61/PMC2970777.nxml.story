Failure of coping machanisms in handling urges when exposed to high risk situations has been posited as one of the factors associated with relapse of drug use. In the present study there has been an attempt to study the coping mechanisms used by opioid dependent subjects in a recent abstinence attempt. The sample consisted of 100 opioid dependent subjects admitted to the deaddiction centre at A.I.I.M.S. New Delhi. The subjects should have had an abstinence longer than a month's period in the 1 year prior to the study. The coping behaviours were assessed by a semistructured interview schedule based on the coping behaviors inventory of Litmen et al, (1981). The results indicate that a wide variety of cognitive and behavioural startegies are used by subjects to handle temptations when exposed to high risk situations. On an average each subject used 7.4. behaviours. Behavioural strategies were commonly employed and they were: keeping away from users, keeping in company of nonusers, working harder, avoiding places associated with use, etc. In understanding the determinants of the coping mechanisms it was seen that family type determined the use of following behaviours viz, being better off without drugs, thinking of mess resulting from drugs and saying J am well and wish to stay so. Route of drug use was important determinant for using the mechanism i.e., realizing effects on health to keep off the urges in high risk situations
