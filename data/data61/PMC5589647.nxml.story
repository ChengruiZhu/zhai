Radiotherapy is widely used for treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). This study aimed to explore the role of Derlin-1 on the sensitivity of ESCC to radiotherapy and its underlying mechanism. We examined the clinical significance of Derlin-1 in 125 ESCC tissues. We found that Derlin-1 protein was higher in ESCC tissues than that in normal esophageal epithelial tissues. Derlin-1 overexpression was correlated with chemoradiotherapy resistance in ESCC patients and served an independent predictor for short overall survival. siRNA knockdown and plasmid transfection were carried out in ESCC cell lines. Derlin-1 depletion inhibited cell growth while its overexpression facilitated cell growth. Derlin-1 overexpression in Eca-109 cells dramatically enhanced its resistance to radiotherapy with decreased apoptosis rate. On the contrary, Derlin-1 depletion in TE-1 cell line showed the opposite effects. In addition, radioresistance conferred by Derlin-1 was attributed to its role of activating AKT/Bcl-2 signaling pathway and reducing caspase3 cleavage. Blockage of AKT signaling attenuated the role of Derlin-1 on radioresistance. Furthermore, Derlin-1 could interact with PI3K p110Î± in ESCC cell lines. Taken together, Our data demonstrate that Derlin-1 overexpression predicts poor prognosis and protects ESCC from irradiation induced apoptosis through PI3K/AKT/Bcl-2 signaling pathway. Derlin-1 may serve as a novel predictor for radiosentivity and a molecular target for ESCC.
