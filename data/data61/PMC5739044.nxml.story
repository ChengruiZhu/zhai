 (Stål) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), the brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB), has become a major pest. Seven experiments examined the nutrient content of their eggs in the context of female reproductive investment and use for experiments. Among 542 clusters examined, an average egg contained 23.50 ± 0.561 µg lipid, 3.17 ± 0.089 µg glycogen, and 3.08 ± 0.056 µg sugar. Mature eggs within a female’s ovary can make up 61% of her total lipid, 35% of glycogen, and 20% of sugar levels. Eggs obtained from a colony reared on a steady diet are expected to have consistent nutrient content. The age of a parental female only slightly affected the lipid level of oviposited eggs but did not affect glycogen or sugar levels. However, egg nutrient content can differ substantially by the source of the parental females; wild eggs had higher lipid but lower sugar content than colony-produced eggs. Further, the length of time that eggs are frozen influenced egg nutrient content. Freshly laid eggs had higher lipid and lower sugar levels than eggs frozen for 1 or 2 yr. Whether an egg turned grey following removal from cold storage did not affect nutrient content, nor did being frozen within 1 or 3 d of oviposition. The temperature at which eggs were left exposed did not impact egg nutrient content, but glycogen decreased and sugar increased with deployment time. This information combined with how factors affect host selection by natural enemies will help refine future experiments that use BMSB egg clusters.
