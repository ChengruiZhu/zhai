The migration pathways for dendritic cells (DC) from the blood are not yet completely resolved. In our previous study, a selective recruitment of DC progenitors from the blood to the liver was suggested. To clarify the role of the hepatic sinusoids in the migration of blood DC, relatively immature DC and mature DC were isolated from hepatic and intestinal lymph, and intravenously transferred to allogeneic hosts. It was then possible to detect small numbers of DC within secondary lymphoid tissues either by immunostaining for donor type major histocompatibility complex class I antigen or, at much higher sensitivity, for bromodeoxyuridine incorporated by proliferating cells (mainly T lymphocytes), which responded to the alloantigen presented by the administered DC. The intravenously injected DC accumulated in the paracortex of regional lymph nodes of the liver via a lymph-borne pathway. Intravenously injected fluorochrome-labeled syngeneic DC behaved similarly. In contrast, very few DC were found in spleen sections and were hardly detectable in other lymph nodes or in other tissues. An in situ cell binding assay revealed a significant and selective binding of DC to Kupffer cells in liver cryosections. It is concluded that rat DC can undergo a bloodâ€“lymph translocation via the hepatic sinusoids, but not via the high endothelial venules of lymph nodes. Hence the hepatic sinusoids may act as a biological concentrator of blood DC into the regional hepatic nodes. Kupffer cells may play an important role in this mechanism.
