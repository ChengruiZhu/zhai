Fistulas still represent one of the most important complications in patients with Crohn’s disease (CD). At least one third of CD patients suffer from fistulas during their disease course and amongst them longstanding remission of complex fistulas occurs only in about one third. So far, fistula pathogenesis is only partially understood. From a histopathological view, a fistula is a tube covered by flat epithelial cells. Current research suggests that the driving force for fistula development is epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Around the fistula, high levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-13, and TGFβ can be detected and recent studies indicated an involvement of the intestinal microbiota. Fistula diagnosis requires clinical and surgical assessment, radiologic investigations, e.g., magnet resonance imaging and endoscopy. Routine medical treatment of fistulas includes antibiotics, immunosuppressives, and anti-TNF antibodies. There is no well-established role for calcineurin inhibitors in fistula treatment, corticosteroids appear to be even contra-productive. A promising novel approach might be the application of adipose tissue-derived or bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells that have been studied recently. Due to insufficient efficacy of medical treatment and recurrence of fistulas, surgical interventions are frequently necessary. Further research is needed to better understand fistula pathogenesis aiming to develop novel treatment option for our patients.
