 Generally, adults living in parts of the world where malaria is common develop protective immunity against the parasite. This means they may get infected but not become ill as a result. However, there are individuals, such as pregnant women and children under the age of five, who are more likely to develop symptoms of malaria due to no (or reduced) natural immunity. A successful malaria vaccine would stimulate an individual's immune system to respond to the malaria parasite and prevent serious clinical disease. Many different groups are currently developing potential vaccines. Several candidates are based on a protein called MSP1 (merozoite surface protein 1) which is found on the surface of the blood-stage form of the malaria parasite. However, in nature parasites carry different versions of the MSP1 protein, and ideally a successful vaccine would bring about immune responses against these different versions. The researchers carrying out this trial wanted to compare the safety and immune responses against candidate vaccines representing two different MSP1 proteins, which covered many different parasite lines. As a phase 1 trial, the study was carried out in healthy adult volunteers. Sixty individuals were assigned to receive an injection of the vaccines, either containing a recombinant protein analogous to the FVO parasite line (termed MSP1 The safety outcomes of the trial showed that the most common type of side effect experienced by the volunteers was pain at the injection site. The vast majority of such events were graded as mild, although there was one single case of a severe event (high levels of pain experienced by one volunteer at the injection site). There was no significant association between the chance of side effects and the vaccine dosage that an individual received. Following vaccination, antibody levels against the protein on which the vaccine was based were detected, although these levels dropped over time. The researchers did not see a strong association between the vaccine dosage that individuals received and the level of antibody response. However, the two vaccines when compared seemed to be equally good at raising an immune response and both caused antibodies to be raised corresponding to different variants of the MSP1 protein. However, the antibodies raised did not seem to be particularly effective at preventing malaria parasites from growing in lab culture.
