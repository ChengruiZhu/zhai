The main indication of All-On-4 standard care is an atrophic maxilla or mandible, with or without remnant hopeless tooth. in ASA I or II patients. This surgical-prosthetic protocol seems efficient, safe and effective in the case of Cawood & Howell class IV, V and VI. It is necessary for the implant to have had an insertion torque of over 35 Ncm for immediate loading. The provisional prosthesis should provide rigidity, being non-flexible in order to avoid micro-movements, and should be strong enough to not fracture. Balanced occlusion without interferences is required, ensuring very gentle dynamic movements. The design of the definitive prosthesis must be cleanable and biomechanically adjusted to the implant position and individual characteristics of each patient. A non-concave acrylic base resting over soft tissue is recommended, facilitating hygiene. Regarding occlusion, a group guide should be made, taking into account whether the antagonist is not a removable complete denture. In that case, bi-balanced occlusion should be assessed. Prosthetic complications occur as a result of fractures of the provisional acrylic prostheses. These problems in turn can be resolved by repair through relining or fixing. The most frequent biological complication is the loss of at least one implant, while the second most frequent complication is the development of peri-implantitis and mucositis.
