A fraction obtained from detergent-extract of sea urchin or starfish spermatozoa using DEAE-cellulose chromatography reactivated Triton X- 100 models of the spermatozoa in a cAMP-dependent manner. The DEAE fraction contained cAMP-dependent protein kinase with a high level of specific activity. Rabbit muscle inhibitor protein highly specific for cAMP-dependent protein kinases inhibited the ability of the deae fraction to induce reactivation of Triton X-100 models.l This inhibition paralleled inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity of the DEAE fraction, suggesting participation of the enzyme in the cAMP-dependent reactivation of Triton X-100 models. However, cAMP-dependent protein kinase further purified from the DEAE fraction was incapable of reactivating these models by itself. A protein factor which was separated from the protein kinase in the course of purification of the enzyme was found to also be necessary for the reactivation. When cAMP-dependent protein kinase was pretreated with protein kinase inhibitor before addition of the protein factor, the reactivation of Triton X-100 models was no longer detected. However, after the protein factor had been incubated with cAMP and cAMP- dependent protein kinase, protein kinase inhibitor did not repress reactivation of Triton X-100 models. We propose that the reactivation needs phosphorylation of the protein factor by cAMP-dependent protein kinase.
