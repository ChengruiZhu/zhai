Gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma) is the macrophage-activating factor (MAF) produced by normal murine splenic cells and the murine T cell hybridoma 24/G1 that induces nonspecific tumoricidal activity in macrophages. Incubation of 24/G1 supernatants diluted to 8.3 IRU IFN-gamma/ml with 6 X 10(6) elicited peritoneal macrophages or bone marrow-derived macrophages for 4 h at 37 degrees C, resulted in removal of 80% of the MAF activity from the lymphokine preparation. Loss of activity appeared to result from absorption and not consumption because (a) 40% of the activity was removed after exposure to macrophage for 30 min at 4 degrees C, (b) no reduction of MAF activity was detected when the 24/G1 supernatant was incubated with macrophage culture supernatants, and (c) macrophage-treated supernatants showed a selective loss of MAF activity but not interleukin 2 (IL-2) activity. Absorption was dependent on the input of either IFN-gamma or macrophages and was time dependent at 37 degrees C but not at 4 degrees C. With four rodent species tested, absorption of murine IFN-gamma displayed species specificity. However, cultured human peripheral blood monocytes and the human histiocytic lymphoma cell line U937 were able to absorb the murine lymphokine. Although the majority of murine cell lines tested absorbed 24/G1 MAF activity, two murine macrophage cell lines, P388D1 and J774, were identified which absorbed significantly reduced amounts of natural IFN- gamma. Purified murine recombinant IFN-gamma was absorbed by elicited macrophages but not by P388D1. Normal macrophages but not P388D1 bound fluoresceinated microspheres coated with recombinant IFN-gamma and binding was inhibited by pretreatment of the normal cells with 24/G1 supernatants. Scatchard plot analysis showed that 12,000 molecules of soluble 125I-recombinant IFN-gamma bound per bone marrow macrophage with a Ka of 0.9 X 10(8) M-1. Binding was quantitatively inhibitable by natural IFN-gamma but not by murine IFN alpha. IFN-beta competed only weakly. Monoclonal antibodies against IFN-gamma either inhibited or enhanced MAF activity by blocking or increasing IFN-gamma binding to macrophages, respectively. These results indicate that IFN-gamma reacts with a receptor on macrophage in a specific and saturable manner and this interaction initiates macrophage activation.
