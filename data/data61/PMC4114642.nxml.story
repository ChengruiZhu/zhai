The B7 family consists of activating and inhibitory molecules that regulate immune responses. Recent research demonstrated the roles of soluble B7-H3 (sB7-H3) and soluble B7-H1 (sB7-H1) in the blood serum of various tumors; however, none of these studies investigated the expression of these proteins in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and blood serum of patients with glioma. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of B7-H3 and B7-H1 in the CSF, blood serum and tissues of patients with glioma and their correlation with clinicopathological data. Between January 2012 and November 2012, samples were obtained from 78 patients with glioma, four CSF samples were obtained from patients with a moderate traumatic brain injury, four brain tissue samples were obtained from patients with a traumatic brain injury and 40 blood serum samples were obtained from healthy individuals. The expression of B7-H3 and B7-H1 in the CSF, blood serum and tumor samples of the patients with high-grade glioma was found to be higher than that in the patients with low-grade glioma. However, no significant differences in sB7-H3 and sB7-H1 expression were observed in the blood serum of the patients with glioma compared with the healthy control subjects. In addition, the expression of sB7-H3 and sB7-H1 in the CSF of the patients with glioma was higher than that in the CSF of the patients with a moderate traumatic brain injury. Furthermore, in the patients with glioma, B7-H3 and B7-H1 expression in the CSF and tumor tissue, although not in the blood serum, correlated with the glioma grade.
