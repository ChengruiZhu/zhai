The specific binding and inhibitory action of (3H)ouabain were employed to localize transport Na,K-ATPase in the euryhaline teleost gill, a NaCl-transporting osmoregulatory tissue in which both enzyme activity and transepithelial transport vary with environmental salinity. In killifish fully adapted to 10%, 100%, or 200% seawater, the gills were internally perfused and externally irrigated in situ. After suitable internal or external exposure to (3H)ouabain, individual gill arches were excised for Na,K-ATPase assay, measurement of radiolabel binding, or quantitative high-resolution autoradiography. Internal exposure to 50 muM ouabain resulted in essentially complete enzyme inhibition, and binding paralleled the increases in enzyme activity at higher salinities; in contrast, external exposure gave minimal and erratic results consistent with leakage of external ouabain into interstitial fluid. (3H)Ouabain autoradiographs demonstrated that, irrespective of exposure or salinity, most of the gill binding was associated with chloride cell. These cells increased in size and number with salinity and, at the subcellular level, the distribution pattern for bound ouabain was always identical to that for the amplified basal-lateral (tubular system) membrane. The combined physiologicmorphologic results constitute final direct proof that chloride cells are the primary site of gill Na,K-ATPase. More important, they provide convincing evidence for unexpected increases in basal-lateral enzyme at higher salinities and thus raise a fundamental objection to the long-postulated role of the Na pump in secretory NaCl transport.
