The gallbladder can be situated in a variety of anomalous positions. An intrahepatic gallbladder – the second most common ectopic location of the gallbladder – is one that is completely embedded within the liver parenchyma. Described in the literature as early as 1935, intrahepatic gallbladders predominantly result from a developmental anomaly but in some instances have been reported to be secondary to chronic inflammation. The significance of an intrahepatic gallbladder lies in the fact that 60% of the cases are associated with gallstones and may present a challenge for the general surgeon during cholecystectomy and other biliary operations in addition to causing misdiagnosis on imaging. Intrahepatic gallbladders are unusual, but the incidence of an intrahepatic gallbladder with a cholecystogastric fistula is rare. Cholecystogastric fistulas commonly are a complication of long-term cholelithiasis or chronic cholecystitis with subsequent gallstone ileus. Herein, we present the case of an 80-year-old man who presented with 2 months of progressive weakness, fatigue, decreased appetite, and intermittent right-sided abdominal pain, and was found to have a markedly distended and irregular intrahepatic gallbladder measuring 12.2 × 11.5 × 13.4 cm on CT, as well as a cholecystogastric fistula on esophagogastroduodenoscopy. During esophagogastroduodenoscopy, the gallbladder was entered directly via the fistulous tract. The patient was on i.v. antibiotics with tube feeds via a nasojejunal tube initially, followed by p.o. which he tolerated. He was eventually discharged with referral for surgical evaluation. Given the potential for cholelithiasis and fistulation, physicians should have a high index of suspicion and recommend timely endoscopic and/or surgical management to avoid future complications.
