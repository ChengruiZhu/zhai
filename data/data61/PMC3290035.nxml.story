Cavernous sinus syndrome is a rare entity in oncology reported only in occasional case reports. Optimal therapy is thus poorly defined with rapidly progressive disease dominating the picture. Management includes prompt diagnosis, attempts at stabilization of cranial nerve function, and aggressive control of central pain syndrome. Here, we report cavernous sinus syndrome secondary to the original squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. With common presenting causes of this syndrome being infection, thrombosis or tumor, it might seem that metastatic tumor would be expected in a patient with a cancer diagnosis. What was not so expected was the extremely rapid progression from mild headache and mild trigeminal neuralgia with negative-contrast head CT to a massive, destructive lesion involving several skull bones and skull base, only 3 weeks later. In addition, the patient was severely immunosuppressed at the completion of induction chemotherapy. Infectious processes, although unlikely, were considered, as aggressive cancer therapy (including high-dose steroids and radiation therapy) had no impact on this disease. Despite accurate localization, the aggressive nature of this disease with massive bone destruction and dural thickening limited any chance of a durable control. We discuss the process of evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of symptoms and the importance of a team approach to best palliate these unfortunate patients.
