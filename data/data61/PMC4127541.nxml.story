Interest is increasing in the use of sequential or combined therapeutic modalities for spot or area treatment of actinic keratoses (AKs) to achieve complete sustained remission. For multiple lesions in a contained area, topical treatment offers less discomfort, better cosmesis and greater patient convenience than destructive/ablative techniques. Twelve patients with multiple grade I and II AK lesions of the scalp (cases 1–10) or the dorsum of the hand (cases 11 and 12), most with a history of recurrence, were treated with Solaraze gel (3% diclofenac sodium in 2.5% hyaluronic acid) twice daily for 12 weeks, followed by a 2-week treatment-free interval, then Actikerall cutaneous solution (5-fluorouracil 5 mg/g and salicylic acid 100 mg/g) once daily for up to 6 weeks as required. Sequential treatment provided complete (clinical and histological) clearance in 8/10 male patients. Two patients with numerous lesions had partial clearance (significant improvement) and the remaining few lesions were treated with erbium laser. Both female patients achieved complete clinical clearance with sequential treatment. Solaraze/Actikerall were well tolerated. A case of contact dermatitis with Solaraze resolved after discontinuation and the patient progressed to treatment with Actikerall. Local application site reactions resolved upon treatment completion. Topical lesion-directed sequential treatment with Solaraze/Actikerall is a rational approach to treat patients with multiple AKs. Sequential treatment produces excellent clearance rates which are accompanied by relevant improvement in patients’ quality of life.
