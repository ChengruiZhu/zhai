 The Reuber hepatoma H-35 and Morris hepatoma 5123 have been studied by electron microscopy and by cytochemical staining methods for a number of phosphatases. These studies emphasize the resemblances of the two tumors to rat liver, but they also indicate distinctive features in each of the three tissues. Secretory product accumulates within the cisternae of the Golgi apparatus that dilate to form the Golgi vacuoles. The vacuoles apparently separate, and secretory material undergoes further condensation within them. These "secretory vacuoles" possess acid phosphatase activity and may thus be considered lysosomes. The membranes of the Golgi apparatus are without acid phosphatase activity but show high levels of thiaminepyrophosphatase activity. The endoplasmic reticulum also hydrolyzes thiaminepyrophosphate but at a lower rate; it hydrolyzes the diphosphates of uridine, guanosine, and inosine rapidly. These observations and the electron microscopic images are consistent with the view that the cytomembranes are in a dynamic state of flux, movement, and transformation in the living cell, and that smooth surfaced derivatives of the endoplasmic reticulum become refashioned into the Golgi membranes as the Golgi membranes are being refashioned into those that delimit secretory vacuoles. The variations encountered in the two hepatomas are described. The electron microscope literature dealing with the relations of the Golgi apparatus to secretory granules, on the one hand, and the endoplasmic reticulum, on the other, is reviewed briefly.
