Forty-one patients (45 shoulders) with MDI were treated with arthroscopic stabilization and were at least 2 years out from surgery. Of these patients, 32/39 (82%) reported a preoperative instability event while participating in a recreational or competitive sport. There were 25 men and 16 women with a mean age at the time of surgery of 26 (range, 16-65 years) with an average subjective follow-up of 2.9 years. Men were significantly older than women at time of surgery (mean age 28 vs 20: p=.001) but no differences was seen in outcome scores between genders. Four patients (4/45) progressed to another instability surgery at a mean of 25 months (range, 13-68 months). Kaplan Meier survivorship analysis at 1 year was 100% and 90.7% at 2 years (Figure 1). Feelings of subluxation significantly improved postoperatively from pre-op levels (p=.017). Overall, all patient-derived subjective outcomes scores improved significantly from preoperative levels. In a subgroup analysis, outcomes scores of patients with a traumatic onset of instability all improved from preoperative levels (p<.05). However, patients with atraumatic onset of instability had ASES scores that significantly improved from preoperative levels, while their QuickDASH, SANE and SF-12 Physical Component scores did not. At final follow-up, patients with traumatic onset of instability were significantly more satisfied with outcomes (10 vs 9: p=.028) than those with an atraumatic onset.
