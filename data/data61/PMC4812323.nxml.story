Wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (Wip1), also termed PPM1D, is a member of the protein phosphatase 2C family, which is characterized by distinctive oncogenic properties. Overexpression of Wip1 is observed in certain types of human tumors that are associated with significantly poor prognosis. The present study aimed to detect the expression of Wip1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to analyze its prognostic value in such patients. The protein expression level of Wip1 was compared between NSCLC and normal lung tissue specimens using by immunohistochemistry, and it was found that Wip1 was highly expressed in NSCLCs but was absent or weakly expressed in normal lung tissues. Detailed clinical and demographic information of patients were retrospectively collected pre- and postoperatively, and Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox's regression analyses were performed to evaluate the prognosis of patients. Survival analysis revealed that the overall survival rate for patients in the Wip1-positive expression group was significantly lower than that of the Wip1-negative group, and Cox multivariate analysis indicated that positive Wip1 expression, pN classification and pathological stage were significant prognostic predictors. The results of the current study suggest that Wip1 may be associated with pathological diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of NSCLC.
