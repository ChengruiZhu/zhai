This study aims to estimate the incidence and costs of osteoporosis-related fractures in The Netherlands in 2010 and project them to 2030. The incidence and costs of five different types of fractures (spine, hip, upper extremity, lower extremity, wrist/distal forearm, other) were derived from claims data of all Dutch healthcare insurers. Given that fracture-codes in claims data do not indicate whether fractures are related to osteoporosis, we used a large dataset with DXA measurements to attribute fractures to osteoporosis. Future projections used four scenarios: (1) demographic, (2) demographic + annual trend in incidence rates, (3) demographic + annual trend in incidence rates + annual trend in costs, and (4) treatment. Of all registered fractures, 32 % was attributed to osteoporosis (36 % in women and 21 % in men). Over time (2010–2030) the increase in incidence of osteoporosis-related fractures was estimated to be 40 % (scenario 1); for the hip 60–79 % (scenario 1–2). In 2010, approximately €200 million was spent on treatment of osteoporosis-related fractures, most on fractures of the hip followed by wrist/distal forearm. In both men and women, the excess costs due to osteoporosis-related fractures were highest for hip fractures (€11,000–€13,000 per person), followed by spine fractures (€6000–€7000).The costs for osteoporosis-related fractures were projected to increase with 50 % from 2010 to 2030 (scenario 1); for the hip 60–148 % (scenario 1–3). Pharmacotherapeutic prevention can lead to cost-savings of €377 million in 2030 (scenario 1 and 4 combined). The projected increase in incidence and costs of osteoporosis-related fractures calls for a wider use of prevention and treatment.
