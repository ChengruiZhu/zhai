Cluster of differentiation (CD)24 was originally described as a B lymphocyte marker and has recently received considerable attention in cancer research as its overexpression has been observed in several types of carcinoma. The CD24 molecule is a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-linked cell surface protein that appears to be associated with aggressive cancers involving invasion and metastasis. However, the expression of CD24 in human bladder cancer and its clinical significance remains largely unknown and no association has been reported between CD24 overexpression and human bladder tumor recurrence. In the present study, the CD24 expression in cancer tissues obtained during transurethral surgery and the subsequent intra-bladder tumor recurrence following surgery were assessed. Immunohistochemical staining was performed and the intensity of CD24 staining was semi-quantitatively evaluated. CD24 expression was observed more frequently in high-grade bladder tumors (G2â€“G3) than low-grade tumors (G1). Positive CD24 expression was significantly associated with intra-bladder tumor recurrence following surgery and increased staining intensity was also correlated with recurrence. The positive association between CD24 expression and tumor recurrence was observed in each tumor category (stages Ta and T1, low and high grade). The results demonstrated that CD24 expression is significantly associated with bladder tumor recurrence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal the significance of CD24 as a predictor of bladder cancer recurrence. These insights may lead to future therapeutic strategies targeting CD24 to prevent the dissemination of bladder cancer cells and tumor recurrence.
