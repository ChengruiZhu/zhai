National recommendations on continued administration of aflibercept solution for injection after the first year of treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) have been developed by an expert panel of UK retina specialists, based on clinician experience and treatment outcomes seen in year 2. The 2017 update reiterates that the treatment goal is to maintain or improve the macular structural and functional gains achieved in year 1 while attempting to reduce or minimize the treatment burden, recognizing the need for ongoing treatment. At the end of year 1 (ie, the decision visit at month 11), two treatment options should be considered: do not extend the treatment interval and maintain fixed 8-weekly dosing, or extend the treatment interval using a treat-and-extend regimen up to a maximum 12 weeks. Criteria for considering not extending the treatment interval are persistent macular fluid with stable vision, recurrent fluid, decrease in vision in the presence of fluid, macular hemorrhage, new choroidal neovascularization or any other sign(s) of exudative disease activity considered vision threatening in the opinion of the treating clinician. Treatment extension is recommended for eyes with a dry macula (ie, without macular fluid) and stable vision. Under both options, the treatment interval may be shortened if visual and/or anatomic outcomes deteriorate. Monitoring without treatment may be considered for eyes with a fluid-free macula for a minimum duration of 48 weeks. A patient completing one full year of monitoring without requiring injections may be considered for discharge from clinic. The treatment algorithm incorporates return to fixed 8-weekly dosing for disease reactivation during treatment extension and reinstatement of treatment for disease recurrence following discontinuation or discharge. For bilateral nAMD, either the eye requiring the more intensive treatment or the eye with the better vision, guided by local clinical practice, should determine the retreatment schedule overall.
