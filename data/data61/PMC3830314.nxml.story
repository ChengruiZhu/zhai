Evidence accumulated during the last decade has affirmed that adipocyte leptin insufficiency in the hypothalamus is the primary etiological factor in the pathogenesis of diabetes type 1 and 2 and related metabolic morbidities. Leptin insufficiency disrupts the relay of hypothalamic regulatory information along three descending pathways to the organs in the periphery that normally participate in maintenance of glucose homeostasis on a minute-to-minute basis throughout lifetime. Reinstatement of leptin sufficiency in the hypothalamus by either systemic or central injections, or its provision selectively in the hypothalamus with the aid of gene therapy extinguished hyperglycemia and normalized blood glucose stably during the entire course of treatment in a variety of animal models of diabetes type 1 and 2. In follow-up clinical trials, twice daily leptin treatment in leptinopenic and insulinopenic type 1 diabetics and leptinopenic and hyperinsulinemic type 2 diabetics with congenital lipodystrophy or acquired lipoatrophy normalized blood glucose without any discernible adverse effects during the extended course of treatment. Taken together, these findings have amply endorsed the efficacy of leptin therapy to restore glucose homeostasis in insulin-deficient as well as hyperinsulinemic diabetic patients. Consequently, restoration of optimal hypothalmic signaling to reinstate glucose homeostasis with leptin is a highly suitable new therapeutic strategy to ameliorate diabetes type 1 and 2 for the lifetime and to replace the currently in vogue insulin monotherapy. In view of the relentless challenges posed by the worldwide epidemic of diabetes and soaring treatment costs, taken together with the well-known shortcomings of therapies based on restoring insulin signaling, it is highly critical and timely to undertake new clinical trials that ascertain appropriate dosage and route of leptin delivery to the hypothalamus capable of safely sustaining stable glycemia for lifetime.
