The short arms of five human acrocentric chromosomes contain ribosomal gene (rDNA) clusters where numerous mini-nucleoli arise at the exit of mitosis. These small nucleoli tend to coalesce into one or a few large nucleoli during interphase by unknown mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that the N- and C-terminal domains of a nucleolar protein, hNopp140, bound respectively to α-satellite arrays and rDNA clusters of acrocentric chromosomes for nucleolar formation. The central acidic-and-basic repeated domain of hNopp140, possessing a weak self-self interacting ability, was indispensable for hNopp140 to build up a nucleolar round-shaped structure. The N- or the C-terminally truncated hNopp140 caused nucleolar segregation and was able to alter locations of the rDNA transcription, as mediated by detaching the rDNA repeats from the acrocentric α-satellite arrays. Interestingly, an hNopp140 mutant, made by joining the N- and C-terminal domains but excluding the entire central repeated region, induced nucleolar disruption and global chromatin condensation. Furthermore, RNAi knockdown of hNopp140 resulted in dispersion of the rDNA and acrocentric α-satellite sequences away from nucleolus that was accompanied by rDNA transcriptional silence. Our findings indicate that hNopp140, a scaffold protein, is involved in the nucleolar assembly, fusion, and maintenance.
