Making predictions is a major adaptive brain function. Predicting the timing of upcoming events enables the brain to prepare for them. However, it is unclear how this is achieved. It is believed that in rhythmic environmental context, such as in music and speech, temporal predictions are achieved by synchronizing the naturally occurring brain rhythms to the external rhythms, a process referred to as oscillatory entrainment. We tested whether rhythm-based predictions have unique expressions in behavior and brain activity—as measured by electroencephalogram (EEG)—by comparing rhythmic streams to less rhythmic streams that enable prediction based on memorizing repeating intervals. We show that phase concentration (PC) of neural oscillations—a neural pattern commonly associated with entrainment—occurs to a similar extent in both predictive rhythmic and less rhythmic streams. Using a computational model, we show that these results are not consistent with the predictions of an entrainment mechanism, indicating that PC is not a unique indicator of entrainment. However, we also show that when an expected event is omitted, memory-based predictions can be flexibly reoriented, while rhythm-based predictions lead to immediate obligatory resource withdrawal and larger behavioral costs. This is consistent with resonance, a different prediction of entrainment model. As a whole, the results identify the overlapping and distinct mechanisms of rhythm- and memory-based temporal predictions.
