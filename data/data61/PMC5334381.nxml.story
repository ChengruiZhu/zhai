Clinical transplantology in Poland had its 50th anniversary this year. With the early and long results comparable to the best achieved in the world leading centers, we face old and completely new challenges for this medical speciality. Main and growing challenge is insufficient number of available organs. With less than 15 donors/mln population/year Poland stay in the lower row of European countries in this measurement of transplant activity. Donation system is not efficient enough and we lose a big number of potential donors still. Living donation (with the exception for the fragments of the liver) remains low despite of different initiatives made so far on the national and local levels. Donation after cardiac death is possible from the point of Polish juridical regulations, but since last 3 years had not showed real impact on country donation rates (only three procedures done). Methods of tissue typing remain slow and cause relatively long times of cold ischemia for kidney programs. Second main challenge is chronic rejection causing loss of organs in the long-term follow-up and no efficient treatment employed. The emerging possibility of tolerance induction despite of plenty of new protocols proposition in the publications does not show up a clinical everyday practice in work. The same is with xenotransplantation promises; even we were informed recently that till 2030 such genetically modified porcine organs will be available. The next challenge is production of organs and tissues from own recipients cells installed on the different scaffolds or 3D printed. Other challenge is the personnel working in this field. We observe like in the other European countries lack of new candidates for work in this field together with serious problems of nursing staff, being a catastrophic perspective in country medical service in general, not only in transplant centers. The last but not least challenge is financial side of transplant programs.
