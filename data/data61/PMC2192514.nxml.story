To multiply and cause disease in the host, Mycobacterium tuberculosis must acquire iron from the extracellular environment at sites of replication. To do so, the bacterium releases high-affinity iron- binding siderophores called exochelins. In previous studies, we have described the purification and characterization of the exochelin family of molecules. These molecules share a common core structure with another type of high-affinity iron-binding molecule located in the cell wall of M. tuberculosis: the mycobactins. The water-soluble exochelins differ from each other and from water insoluble mycobactins in polarity, which is dependent primarily upon the length and modifications of an alkyl side chain. In this study, we have investigated the capacity of purified exochelins to remove iron from host high-affinity iron-binding molecules, and to transfer iron to mycobactins. Purified desferri-exochelins rapidly removed iron from human transferrin, whether it was 95 or 40% iron saturated, its approximate percent saturation in human serum, and from human lactoferrin. Desferri-exochelins also removed iron, but at a slower rate, from the iron storage protein ferritin. Purified ferri- exochelins, but not iron transferrin, transferred iron to desferri- mycobactins in the cell wall of live bacteria. To explore the possibility that the transfer iron from exochelins to mycobactins was influenced by their polarity, we investigated the influence of polarity on the iron affinity of exochelins. Exochelins of different polarity exchanged iron equally with each other. This study supports the concept that exochelins acquire iron for M. tuberculosis by removing this element from host iron-binding proteins and transferring it to desferri- mycobactins in the cell wall of the bacterium. The finding that ferri- exochelins but not iron transferrin transfer iron to mycobactins in the cell wall underscores the importance of exochelins in iron acquisition. This study also shows that the variable alkyl side chain on the core structure of exochelins and mycobactins, the principal determinant of their polarity, has little or no influence on their iron affinity.
