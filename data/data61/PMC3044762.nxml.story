Learning to associate relevant stimuli in our environment is important for survival. For example, identification of an object, such as an edible fruit, may require us to recognize a unique combination of features – color, shape, size – each of which is present in other, perhaps inedible, objects. Thus, how the brain associates distinct stimuli to produce specific responses to particular combinations of stimuli is of fundamental importance in neuroscience. We aim to address this question using computational models of initially non-functional, randomly connected networks of spiking neurons, which are modified by correlation-based learning rules identified experimentally. Correlation-based learning rules use the spikes of neurons to change connection strength between neurons. Correlation-based learning rules can enhance stimulus-pair representations that arise naturally in random networks. Altering the strength of inhibitory-to-excitatory connections alone was the most beneficial change, generating high stimulus-pair selectivity and reliably correct decisions across the widest range of networks. Surprisingly, changing connections between excitatory cells alone often impaired stimulus-pair selectivity, leading to unreliable decisions. However, such impairment was ameliorated or reversed by changes in the inhibitory-to-excitatory connections of those networks. Our findings demonstrate that initial heterogeneity and correlation-based changes of inhibitory synaptic strength can help generate stable network responses to stimulus-pairs.
