Screening out patients who do not require immediate surgery is a growing trend in the field of thyroid research. In this study, we retrospectively compared the application of two surveillance selection criteria in 1001 patients who had undergone surgical treatment of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC): low-risk PTMC characteristics defined by Kuma Hospital and CATO consensus on PTMC management of active surveillance. Treatment outcomes were compared between groups. We then analyzed the prognostic indicators of patients who could be managed by surveillance. A total of 724 patients met Kuma screening criteria and 135 met CATO screening criteria. The Kuma low-risk group had a lower incidence of multifocal lesions and CLNM than Kuma high-risk group. We also found more obvious differences in multifocal lesions, CLNM and extrathyroidal extension when evaluating the CATO low-risk criteria in the same manner. On the other hand, patients in the CATO low-risk group had a lower disease progression rate and longer disease-free survival than those in CATO high-risk group. There was no significant difference in prognosis between the Kuma low-risk group and Kuma high-risk group. Our logistic regression analysis showed that a preoperative ultrasound size of >5 mm, male sex, younger age, and malignant lesions without concurrent benign nodules could be predictors of CLNM. In conclusion, patients classified in CATO low-risk criteria had lower proportion of clinicopathological risk factors than the ones in Kuma low-risk criteria. We also found more risk factors may not be suitable for surveillance, such as tumors without concurrent benign nodules.
