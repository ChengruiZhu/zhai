Microtubule-associated protein 1A (MAP1A) and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) were shown to be colocalized on the same microtubules (MTs) within neuronal cytoskeletons by double-label immunoelectron microscopy. To investigate the electron microscopic disposition of MAP1A and MAP2 and their relationship to MTs in vivo, and to determine whether there are different subsets of MTs which specifically bind either MAP1 or MAP2, we employed a double-label immunogold procedure on rat cerebella using mouse monoclonal antibody against rat brain MAP1A and affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody against rat brain MAP2. MAP1A and MAP2 were identified with secondary antibodies coupled to 10- and 5-nm gold particles, respectively. In Purkinje cell dendrites, both 10- and 5-nm gold particles were observed to be studded on the fuzzy structures attached to the same MTs. Many such structures connected MTs to each other. There was no particular MT which bound either MAP1A or MAP2 alone. Furthermore, there seemed to be no specific regions on MTs where either MAP1A or MAP2 was specifically attached. Hence, we conclude that MAP1A and MAP2 are colocalized on MTs in dendrites and assume that MAP1A and MAP2 have some interrelationship in vivo and that their interactions are responsible for forming the network of cross-bridges between MTs and MTs in neuronal cytoskeletons.
