It is desirable to have a biomarker which can facilitate low‐dose CT in diagnosis of early stage lung cancer. CTAPIII/CXCL7 is reported to be a potential biomarker for diagnosis of early lung cancer. In this study, we investigated the serum level of CTAPIII/CXCL7 in patients at different stage of lung cancer and the diagnostic efficacy of CTAPIII/CXCL7 in NSCLC. The plasma level of CTAPIII/CXCL7 was assayed by ELISA. CEA, SCCAg, and Cyfra211 were measured using a commercial chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. A total of 419 subjects were recruited, including 265 NSCLC patients and 154 healthy individuals. The subjects were randomly assigned to a training set and a test set. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and binary logistic regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy and establish diagnostic mathematical model. Plasma CTAPIII/CXCL7 levels were significantly higher in NSCLC patients than in controls, which was independent of the stage of NSCLC. The diagnostic efficiency of CTAPIII/CXCL7 in NSCLC (training set: area under ROC curve (AUC) 0.806, 95% CI: 0.748–0.863; test set: AUC 0.773, 95% CI: 0.711–0.835) was greater than that of SCCAg, Cyfra21‐1, or CEA. The model combining CTAPIII/CXCL7 with CEA, SCCAg, and Cyfra21‐1 was more effective for NSCLC diagnosis than CTAPIII/CXCL7 alone. In addition, plasma level of CTAPIII/CXCL7 may contribute to the early diagnosis of NSCLC. CTAPIII/CXCL7 can be used as a plasma biomarker for the diagnosis of NSCLCs, particularly early stage lung cancer, with relatively high sensitivity and specificity.
