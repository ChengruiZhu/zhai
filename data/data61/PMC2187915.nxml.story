We demonstrate that tumor-bearing hosts permit the outgrowth of "potentially malignant" cells that are located at a different site. These second cancers continued to grow and kill their hosts even though they retain the "premalignant" phenotype, even after removal of the original malignancy. The potentially malignant cells used in these experiments were ultraviolet light- or methylcholanthrene-induced regressor tumor cells that are rejected regularly by normal mice at any testable dose, and only form progressive tumors in immunosuppressed individuals. The immunological rejection of these highly immunogenic, potentially malignant cells was suppressed by Thy-1+, Ly-2-, nonadherent, radio-sensitive suppressor cells in the tumor-bearing mice. These suppressor cells were absent in nude tumor-bearing mice. Unlike helper and cytolytic T cell-mediated responses, which are exquisitely tumor specific, the suppression caused by a progressively growing tumor was crossreactive among many syngeneic, independently derived tumors induced by different carcinogens. However, T cell- mediated immune responses to alloantigens, allogeneic tumors, certain syngeneic tumors, and humoral responses to xenogeneic red blood cells were normal in these mice. The immune suppression in the tumor-bearing animals closely simulated that induced by ultraviolet light irradiation, and both types of suppression might therefore share common mechanisms. Our findings may contribute to understanding the growth, development, and possible control of multicentric malignancies and add a precaution to the potential use of strongly immunogenic tumor variants for active immunotherapy in hosts bearing less immunogenic tumors.
