Colorectal cancer (CRC) is currently the most prevalent malignant cancer worldwide. However, there is a lack of efficient biomarkers for CRC screening. Accumulating evidence reveals that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) detectable in serum are associated with the genesis and development of various types of cancer. Therefore, we examined the diagnostic ability of lncRNAs in blood samples from patients with CRC by evaluating the levels of 17 CRC- or gastrointestinal cancer-related lncRNAs in serum samples from 71 CRC patients and 70 healthy individuals using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). We detected 13 lncRNAs in serum, three of which displayed significantly different levels between CRC patients and healthy controls. A three-lncRNA signature (LOC285194, RP11-462C24.1 and Nbla12061) identified via stepwise regression analysis showed potential as a diagnostic marker for CRC. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of this signature for distinguishing CRC patients from healthy individuals was 0.793 (95% CI: 0.709 to 0.861). The diagnostic ability of this marker was much higher than that of conventional blood biomarkers such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen 199 (CA199), carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125) and carbohydrate antigen 724 (CA724). Combining this novel marker with conventional biomarkers produced even greater diagnostic ability. Furthermore, the levels of the three lncRNAs decreased after the patients underwent surgical resection. The results of this study suggest an additional marker for CRC screening and provide new directions for further investigation.
