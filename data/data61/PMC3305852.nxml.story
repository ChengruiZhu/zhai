Semaphorins are secreted and membrane bound proteins involved in neural pathfinding, organogenesis, and tumor progression, through Plexin and neuropilins receptors. We recently reported that Plexin B1, the Semaphorin 4D receptor, is a tumor suppressor protein for melanoma, in part, through inhibition of the oncogenic c-Met tyrosine kinase receptor. In this report we show that Sema4D is a protective paracrine factor for normal human melanocyte survival in response to ultraviolet irradiation, that it stimulates proliferation, and regulates the activity of the c-Met receptor. c-Met receptor signaling stimulates melanocyte migration, in part through down-regulation of the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin. Sema4D suppressed activation of c-Met in response to its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and partially blocked the suppressive effects of HGF on E-cadherin expression in melanocytes and HGF-dependent migration. These data demonstrate a role for Plexin B1 in maintenance of melanocyte survival and proliferation in the skin, and suggest that Semaphorin 4D and Plexin B1 act cooperatively with HGF and c-Met to regulate c-Met dependent effects in human melanocytes. Because our data show that Plexin B1 is profoundly down-regulated by UVB in melanocytes, loss of Plexin B1 may accentuate HGF dependent effects on melanocytes, including melanocyte migration.
