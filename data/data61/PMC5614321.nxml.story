We determined the prevalence of hypertension, medication usage and attainment of blood pressure goals in older (≥65 to <80 years and ≥80 years) urban community-dwelling Chinese subjects. Data were obtained in 3950 subjects (mean age 72.0 years, 1745 male) including 609 subjects aged ≥80 years in the Shanghai Elderly Cardiovascular Health Study (SHECHS). Established cardiovascular disease was present in 7.7% of participants. The prevalence of hypertension was 74.8% overall and it was more than 80% in individuals considered to be in moderate and higher cardiovascular disease risk categories. In hypertensive subjects, 67.1% were on treatment and treatment was more frequent in high and very high cardiovascular risk individuals. Attainment of the systolic blood pressure goal <150 mmHg was 62.9% and was greater in the ≥65 to <80 years group than in the ≥80 years group. The most commonly used antihypertensive treatments were calcium channel blockers (54.2%), followed by angiotensin receptor blockers (43.1%). Diuretics were used in 2.6%. Fixed-dose combination antihypertensive tablets were used in some of the ≥65 to <80 years group (12.4%) and more of the ≥80 years group (18.2%) and 70.9% of the ≥65 to <80 years group and 80.2% of the ≥80 years group were on monotherapy. There were high prevalence and high treatment rates of hypertension, but poor attainment of the systolic blood pressure goal of <150 mmHg, especially in the ≥80 years group of community-dwelling Chinese. Considering that more intensive treatment of hypertension in older subjects may be warranted after recent studies, this might be achieved by more frequent use of combinations of effective therapies and diuretics.
