Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disease that causes the body to produce thick mucus that clogs the lungs and obstructs the breakdown and absorption of food. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is mutated in CF patients, and the most common mutation causes three defects in CFTR: misfolding, decreased function, and rapid degradation. Drugs are currently being studied to correct the first two CFTR defects, but the problem of rapid degradation remains. Recently, key protein-protein interactions have been discovered that implicate the protein CAL in CFTR degradation. Here we have developed new computational protein design algorithms and used them to successfully predict peptide inhibitors of the CAL-CFTR interface. Our algorithm uses a structural ensemble-based evaluation of protein sequences and conformations to calculate accurate predictions of protein-peptide binding affinities. The algorithm is general and can be applied to a wide variety of protein-protein interface designs. All of our designed inhibitors bound CAL with high affinity. We tested our top binding peptide and observed that the inhibitor could successfully rescue CFTR function in CF patient-derived epithelial cells. Our designed inhibitors provide a novel therapeutic path which could be used in combination with existing CF therapeutics for additive benefit.
