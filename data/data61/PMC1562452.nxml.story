Reinforcement learning, based on the association of a stimulus-triggered movement with a reward, involves changes in connection strength between neurons. Memory storage occurs in the striatum, the input stage of the basal ganglia, when a stimulus or movement signal originating from the cortex and a reward signal originating from the midbrain reach the target striatal cells together. Repetitive pairing of these two signals strengthens the connection between cortical and striatal cells. The strengthening of the connections is caused by activation of biochemical signalling pathways inside the striatal cells. These intracellular signalling pathways are explored in a quantitative computational model describing the biochemical pathways important for reinforcement learning. Lindskog et al.'s study shows that when brief reward and stimuli signals are paired, a stronger response in the intracellular signalling occurs compared with the situation when each signal is given alone. This result illustrates mechanisms whereby paired stimuli, but not unpaired stimuli, can cause learning. Furthermore, the model predicts that the biochemical responses are different after brief stimulation as compared with prolonged stimulation. This result highlights the difficulties in predicting the nonlinear interactions within signalling cascades based on prolonged stimulations, which often are used in biochemical experiments.
