 1. The theories for the origin of monocytes from myeloblasts, lymphocytes, endothelium, macrophages, and primitive cells are reviewed and considered. 2. Monocytes in all stages of development have been demonstrated to be present constantly in large numbers in all the lymph nodes of the body, except in the large mesenteric group. 3. The relations of these cells to undifferentiated cells, lymphocytes, macrophages, plasma cells, and endothelium are described. 4. The origin of adult monocytes from primitive undifferentiated cells through the stages of monoblasts and pre-monocytes is described and illustrated. 5. The demonstration in certain lymph nodes of innumerable monocytes in all stages of development permits of a shifting of the term "monoblast" from a more or less theoretical name to its proper place as a term designating that particular cell which is derived from a primitive undifferentiated cell and which is the immediate precursor of the pre-monocyte. 6. The term "pre-monocyte" is proposed to designate the intermediate stage between the monoblast and the mature monocyte. 7. Evidence is advanced to show that monocytes are an independent strain of cells, but that under physiological conditions they may be transformed into macrophages, this representing at least one way in which the latter cells normally are produced. 8. In no organs or tissues other than in certain specific lymph nodes, chiefly the peripheral group, can one constantly find monocytes in all stages of development. 9. Developing monocytes occasionally may be found in small numbers in the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, Peyer's patches, subcutaneous connective tissues, lungs, and omenta of normal rabbits, but their presence is by no means constant and their numbers are insignificant in comparison with those found in the peripheral lymph nodes. 10. Monocytes and pre-monocytes do not stain by the common methods used for the demonstration of the reticulo-endothelial system and therefore must be considered for the present as independent of this system, except in so far as monocytes may be transformed into macrophages. 11. Plasma cells, stained with the supravital technique, as seen in lymph nodes, are described. No basis has been found for the theory that plasma cells and monocytes are closely related structural elements.
