, four reports address different aspects of a rare condition, thrombotic microangiopathy, including atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome. For rare diseases, a single case report may provide hypothesis-generating information that may lead to concept-changing research with the potential to influence patient care. The present reports and small series illustrate the following aspects of thrombotic microangiopathy: (i) the role of whole-exome sequencing and of repeating the family history assessment over time in reducing the number of chronic kidney disease patients with non-specific diagnosis (e.g. focal segmental glomerulosclerosis without any further indication as to aetiology or hypertension-attributed kidney disease) and the need for further studies on the potential for type IV collagen mutations to be associated with thrombotic microangiopathy, i.e. the potential for an expanding genetic spectrum; (ii) the expanding clinical spectrum from an acute catastrophic disease to a chronic, mild, stable condition with unknown long-term consequences and uncharted therapeutic approaches; (iii) the expanding therapeutic spectrum, with the successful use of eculizumab to treat thrombotic microangiopathy in the context of overlap autoimmune disease and (iv) the huge worldwide inequalities in the implementation of these and other advances. International collaboration is needed to address these issues and should encompass the wider use of already available registries for this rare disease and the worldwide implementation of current effective, yet expensive, therapies.
