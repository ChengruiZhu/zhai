Carotid cavernous fistulae (CCF) are defined as abnormal connections between the carotid circulation and cavernous sinus. CCFs can be categorized as being direct or indirect. Direct CCFs are usually associated with trauma, whereas indirect CCFs are associated with revascularization following cavernous sinus thrombosis. We present a case of a 53-year-old male who presented with tinnitus, proptosis, conjunctivitis, and blurry vision. The patient had a recent endovascular transvenous embolization that was only partially successful, with a residual carotid cavernous fistula draining to the left superior ophthalmic vein and multiple cortical veins. A physical examination of the patient showed elevated intraocular pressures bilaterally. The patient had a high-flow indirect carotid cavernous fistula with bilateral superior ophthalmic vein (SOV) and retrograde cortical vein drainage. The SOV was punctured with a micropuncture needle and was used to successfully gain access to the cavernous sinus. Multiple coils were placed in the posterior aspect of the sinus until there was complete occlusion of venous flow. Coils were packed up to the posterior aspect of the orbit near the junction of the cavernous sinus with the SOV, and the embolization was successful. Indirect CCFs have gradual onset and are usually low-flow. Low-flow CCFs might improve with medical management.Some CCFs may cause ocular manifestations and can be symptomatically managed with prism therapy or ocular patching for diplopia, lubrication for keratopathy, or topical agents for elevated intraocular pressures. However, patients presenting with persistent ocular morbidity may require surgical or endovascular intervention.
