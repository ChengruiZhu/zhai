Eukaryotic cells affect precise changes in shape and growth in response to environmental and nutritional stress, enabling cell survival and wild-type function. The single-celled budding yeast provides a striking example, undergoing a set of changes under conditions of nitrogen or glucose limitation resulting in the formation of extended cellular chains or filaments. Related filamentous growth transitions are required for virulence in pathogenic fungi and have been studied extensively; however, the full scope of signaling underlying the filamentous growth transition remains to be determined. Here, we used a combination of genetics and proteomics to identify proteins that undergo phosphorylation dependent upon kinases required for filamentous growth. Within this protein set, we identified novel sites of phosphorylation in the yeast proteome and extensive phosphorylation of mRNA-protein complexes regulating mRNA decay and translation. The data indicate an interrelationship between filamentous growth and these ubiquitously conserved sites of RNA regulation: the RNA-protein complexes are required for the filamentous growth transition, and a well studied filamentous growth signaling kinase is required for wild-type numbers of RNA-protein complexes. This interdependence is previously unappreciated, highlighting an additional level of translational control underlying this complex growth transition.
