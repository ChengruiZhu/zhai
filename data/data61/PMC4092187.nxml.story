A 34-year-old male patient visited the emergency room with complaint of right wrist drop and foot drop. The day before, he was intoxicated and fell asleep in a room containing barbeque briquettes; After waking up, he noticed that his right wrist and foot were dropped. Upon physical examination, his right wrist extensor, thumb extensor, ankle dorsiflexor, and big toe extensor showed Medical Research Council (MRC) grade 1 power. The initial laboratory tests suggested rhabdomyolysis induced by unrelieved pressure on the right side during sleep. Right foot drop was improved after conservative care and elevated muscle enzyme became normalized with hydration therapy with no resultant acute renal failure. However, the wrist drop did not show improvement and a hard mass was palpated on the follow-up physical examination. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging studies were conducted and an abnormal mass in the lateral head of the tricep was detected. Axonopathy was suggested by the electrodiagnostic examination. A surgical decompression was done and a fibrotic cord lesion compressing the radial nerve was detected. After adhesiolysis, his wrist extensor power improved to MRC grade 4. Herein, we describe a compressive radial neuropathy associated with rhabdomyolysis successfully treated with surgery and provide a brief review of the related literature.
