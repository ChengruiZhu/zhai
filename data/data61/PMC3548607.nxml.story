Idiopathic sclerosing orbital inflammation is a rare finding that is poorly delineated, immune mediated, and causes severe symptoms and disability. It has been described affecting the orbit in addition to other sites within the head and neck, but has rarely been described presenting as sinusitis. A case report and literature review were performed. A 14-year-old girl with right-sided face and eye pain and pressure for >1 month presented 3 days after endoscopic sinus surgery for presumed acute sinusitis. She subsequently developed ipsilateral vision loss and hypesthesia of the infraorbital nerve. MRI revealed a mildly enhancing soft tissue intensity lesion extending from the right maxillary sinus into the pterygopalatine fossa and orbital apex through the inferior orbital fissure. Biopsy specimens of the lesion were consistent with a sclerosing inflammatory lesion. High-dose steroids led to rapid improvement in vision and pain; however, the patient was unable to tolerate steroid weaning because of recurrence of eye pain and headache. Repeat imaging showed progression of the lesion. Rheumatology was consulted and the patient's steroid therapy was altered and her medications were expanded to include azathioprine. The patient's symptoms improved and subsequent imaging showed a reduction in the size and extent of the lesion. Idiopathic sclerosing inflammation is characterized by primary, chronic, and immunologically mediated fibrosis. Patients typically have a poor response to corticosteroid treatment or radiotherapy. Immunosuppressive therapy in addition to corticosteroids is the recommended treatment.
