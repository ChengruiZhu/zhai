 = 160) underwent osteotomy and were then allocated into vehicle control (CNT) or an ibandronate treatment group: 5 μg/kg daily (DAY, 5 days/week), 75 μg/kg once every 3 weeks (I-3), 150 μg/kg once every 6 weeks (I-6), resulting in the same total ibandronate dose over the study. Rats were killed after 6 or 18 weeks. At 18 weeks, all fracture lines had disappeared in the CNT and I-6 groups; approximately 10% of fracture lines remained in the DAY and I-3 groups. Ibandronate-treated groups showed large callus areas around the fractures, which shrank between 6 and 18 weeks after surgery; the extent of shrinkage decreased with shorter dosing interval. In histomorphometry, callus remodeling was suppressed by ibandronate; this became more apparent at shorter dose intervals. The structural properties of osteotomized femora were increased in the DAY group compared with CNT, but intrinsic material properties reduced inversely and became closer to those of CNT in response to increased dosing interval. Ibandronate induced formation of large calluses around osteotomies but delayed woven bone remodeling into lamellar bone and reduced intrinsic material properties in a rat fracture model. Extending the dosing interval of intermittent ibandronate treatment appeared to reduce the suppression of callus remodeling caused by ibandronate, which would have delayed healing after osteotomy.
