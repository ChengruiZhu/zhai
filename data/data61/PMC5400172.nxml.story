Subjects included a subset of ACL injured patients participating in a randomized clinical trial to compare single- and double bundle ACLR using quadriceps autograft. Subjects were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of injury to ALC, as determined by a fellowship trained radiologist on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans performed within 6 weeks of injury (Kendall’s tau-b for Inter-observer reliability = 0.75). ACLR outcomes were measured 24 months after surgery and included PROs (International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC-SKF) and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)) as well as in vivo joint kinematics during downhill running. In vivo joint kinematics were assessed while subjects performed downhill treadmill running (3.0 meters/second, 10° slope) within a Dynamic Stereo X-ray system (DSX). Knee kinematics were determined using a validated method for matching DSX images to tibiofemoral bone models obtained from subject specific computed tomography scans. A subset of joint kinematic variables (side-to-side differences for peak internal rotation, range of internal/external rotation, peak adduction and range of abduction/adduction) were evaluated in this study. These variables were selected based on the proposed function of the ALC for restraining internal knee rotation. The PROs and knee kinematics were compared between groups with and without ALC injury using independent t-tests. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05.
