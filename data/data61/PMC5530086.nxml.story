The expression of macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1) of early gastric cancer treated using endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and its correlation with prognosis were investigated. One hundred and forty-seven patients with early gastric cancer (less than 20 mm in diameter) were recruited and assigned into an observation group (75 cases) or a control group (72 cases), according to treatment. The control group was treated with a radical resection by the conventional laparotomy approach and the observation group was treated by EMR. Differences in operative outcomes and prognosis were compared between the two groups. Complete lesion resection rates of the two groups were 100%. The amount of bleeding, operation time and postoperative complication rates in the observation group were each significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.05). The serum MIC-1 levels in the two groups were reduced, with the observation group being significantly lower than that of the control group (P<0.05). The progression-free survival was significantly prolonged and the recurrence rate was significantly lower in the observation group compared to the control group, with the difference being statistically significant (P<0.05). In conclusion, EMR treatment of early gastric cancer was observed to be safe and effective in this study and can reduce the expression level of serum MIC-1 after the operation. EMR can also increase the survival period and reduce the recurrence rate, and MIC-1 can be used as an important index to predict the prognosis of the disease.
