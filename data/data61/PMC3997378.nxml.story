The Countdown to 2015 country profiles present, in one place, comprehensive evidence to enable an assessment of a country’s progress in improving reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health. Profiles are available for each of the 75 countries that together account for more than 95% of all maternal and child deaths. The two-page profiles are updated approximately every 2 years with new data and analyses. Profile data include demographics, mortality, nutritional status, coverage of evidence-based interventions, within-countries inequalities in coverage, measures of health system functionality, supportive policies and financing indicators. The main sources of data for the coverage, nutritional status and equity indicators are the US Agency for Internal Development (USAID)-supported demographic and health surveys and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)-supported multiple indicator cluster surveys. Data on coverage are first summarized and checked for quality by UNICEF, and data on equity in intervention coverage are summarized and checked by the Federal University of Pelotas. The mortality estimates are developed by the Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation and the Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group. The financing data are abstracted from datasets maintained by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Assistance Committee, and the policies and health systems data are derived from a special compilation prepared by the World Health Organization. Associated country profiles include equity-specific profiles and one-page profiles prepared annually that report on the 11 indicators selected by the Commission on Information and Accountability for Women’s and Children’s Health.
