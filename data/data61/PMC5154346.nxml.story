Serum biomarkers have not been fully incorporated into clinical use for the diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The recent discovery of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which have been reported in a variety of cancer types, suggested a promising new class of biomarkers for tumour diagnosis. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether the levels of circulating lncRNAs could be used as a tumour marker to discriminate between clear cell RCC (ccRCC) patients and healthy controls. Serum samples were collected from 71 ccRCC patients including 62 age- and sex-matched healthy controls and 8 patients with benign renal tumours. Eighty-two cancer-associated lncRNAs were assessed by reverse transcription and quantitative polymerase chain reaction in paired tissues and serum. A 5-lncRNA signature, including lncRNA-LET, PVT1, PANDAR, PTENP1 and linc00963, were identified and validated in the training set and testing set, respectively. The receiver operating characteristic curves for this serum 5-lncRNA signature were 0.900 and 0.823 for the two sets of serum samples. Moreover, five-minus-one lncRNA signatures demonstrated that none of the lncRNAs had a higher area under the curve than the others in either set. A risk model for the serum 5-lncRNA signature also determined that benign renal tumours can be distinguished from ccRCC samples. This work may facilitate the detection of ccRCC and serve as the basis for further studies of the clinical value of serum lncRNAs in maintaining surveillance and forecasting prognosis.
