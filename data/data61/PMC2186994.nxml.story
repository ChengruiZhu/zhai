Mouse thymidine kinase (tk-) C3H L (H-2k) cells transformed by the technique of DNA-mediated gene transfer with the herpes simplex virus tk gene together with the BALB/c H-2Ld gene express H-2Ld molecules indistinguishable from their counterparts on spleen cells. An established cloned cell line (8-5) was used to assess the function of the H-2Ld antigen in determining the specificity of alloreactive as well as anti-vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) cytotoxic T cells (CTL). Both anti-H-2d and anti-H-2Ld CTL displayed a cytotoxic effect against 8-5 cells but not a control cell line transformed with the tk gene only (tk+ cells). Further evidence that 8-5 cells express H-2Ld was provided by the finding that monoclonal anti-H-2Ld but not H-2Dd antibodies blocked target cell lysis by the effector cells. Both BALB/c (H-2d) and DBA/2 (H-2d) animals generated anti-VSV CTL that lysed infected 8-5 but not tk+ cells. To further establish that H-2Ld controlled the specificity of the effector cells, a monoclonal antibody directed against H-2Ld was shown to inhibit lysis of infected 8-5 target cells. To determine whether other H-2d-encoded gene products could serve as restricting antigens for anti-VSV CTL in BALB/c animals, unlabeled VSV infected 8-5 cells were tested for their ability to block lysis of 51chromium-labeled P815 (H-2d)-infected target cells. The 8-5-VSV inhibitor cells inhibited lysis to a slightly lesser extent than unlabeled P815-VSV cells, indicating that H-2Ld plays a major if not exclusive role in restricting anti-VSV CTL in H-2d animals.
