Most living organisms on earth present biological rhythms that play a fundamental role in the coordination of their physiology and behavior. The discovery of the molecular circadian clock gives important insight into the mechanisms involved in the generation of these rhythms. Indeed, this molecular clock orchestrates the rhythmic transcription of clock-controlled genes involved in different aspects of metabolism, for example lipid, carbohydrate, and xenobiotic metabolisms in the liver. However, we show here that the circadian clock could also exert its function through the coordination of mRNA translation. Namely, the circadian clock influences the temporal translation of a subset of mRNAs by controlling the expression and activation of translation initiation factors, as well as the clock-dependent rhythmic activation of signaling pathways involved in their regulation. These rhythmically translated mRNAs are mainly involved in ribosome biogenesis, an energy consuming process, which has to be gated to a period when the cell resources are less limited. Moreover, the role of the circadian oscillator in this process is highlighted by its direct regulation of the transcription of ribosomal protein mRNAs and ribosomal RNAs. Thus our findings suggest that the circadian clock exerts a major role in coordinating transcription and translation steps underlying ribosome biogenesis.
