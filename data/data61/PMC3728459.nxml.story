The present study was performed to evaluate the relationship between dietary quality indices including the Diet Quality Index-International (DQI-I), Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI), and Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI) and glycemic status in Korean patients with type 2 diabetes. A total of 110 consecutive outpatients with type 2 diabetes who visited 2 university hospitals in Seoul and Seongnam from April 2004 to November 2006 were enrolled as subjects. At the time of enrollment, anthropometric parameters, dietary habits, experience of exercise, and metabolic parameters were obtained. Experienced registered dietitians collected one-day dietary intake using the 24-hour recall method. The mean scores for DQI-I, AHEI, and HDI were 68.9 ± 8.2, 39.4 ± 8.9, and 5.0 ± 1.3, respectively. After adjustment for age, body mass index, and energy intake, DQI-I and HDI were found to have a significant correlation with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (r = -0.21, p < 0.05; r = -0.28, p < 0.05), fasting plasma glucose (r = -0.21, p < 0.05; r = -0.23, p < 0.05), and postprandial 2-h glucose (r = -0.30, p < 0.05; r = -0.26, p < 0.05, respectively). However, AHEI did not have a significant correlation with HbA1c. In conclusion, the DQI-I and HDI may be useful tools in assessing diet quality and adherence to dietary recommendations in Korean patients with type 2 diabetes. Future research is required to determine whether the dietary quality indices have predictive validity for dietary and glycemic changes following diet education in a clinical setting.
