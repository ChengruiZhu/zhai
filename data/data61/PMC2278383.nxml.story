Most mammalian transcription factors and transcriptional co-activators are believed to regulate the activities of numerous genes fulfilling multiple functions. This pleiotropic role has recently been confirmed directly for several individual factors by large-scale mapping studies aimed at generating comprehensive catalogues of their binding sites in the genome. Until now, all transcription factors, for which such studies have been performed, were found to regulate hundreds or even thousands of genes. We demonstrate, here, that the transcriptional co-activator CIITA (class II transactivator) is an exception to this rule. CIITA is a key regulator of the immune system because it controls the transcription of genes coding for Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecules, which are cell-surface molecules that present peptide antigens to T lymphocytes. To address the possibility that CIITA might exert more widespread functions, we have performed extensive genome-wide searches to establish a comprehensive list of CIITA-regulated genes. Surprisingly, we found that CIITA regulates only a small number of genes, most of which code for proteins implicated directly or indirectly in MHC-mediated antigen presentation. CIITA is thus remarkably dedicated for the regulation of a unique set of functionally related genes constituting a genetic module devoted to a single biological process.
