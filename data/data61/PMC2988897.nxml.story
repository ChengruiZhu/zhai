The development of a primary hepatic tumor associated with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) has been rarely reported. This report describes a rare case of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) that accompanied tumor infiltrative lymphocytes (TIL) and AIH-like features. Moreover, multiple early gastric cancers were recognized in synchrony. An 81-year-old male was admitted due to liver dysfunction. His laboratory data on admission showed an elevation of immunoglobulin G and a positive titer of antinuclear antibody. Biological tests for HBV and HCV were negative. Computed tomography showed a well-enhanced hepatic tumor and gastrointestinal fiberscopy revealed two early gastric cancers with mucosal invasion. Biopsies were obtained from the background liver and the hepatic tumor. Histologically, the tumor revealed adenocarcinoma and the liver showed piecemeal necrosis and interface hepatitis with lymphoplasmacytic infiltration. The patient underwent hepatectomy and distal gastrectomy. Finally, he was diagnosed to have a mass forming type ICC and early gastric cancers. Moreover, prominent TIL in the ICC was revealed. An analysis of the infiltrating lymphocytes by immunohistochemical staining suggested that there was a difference in the local immune response between the tumor and the background liver. Review of the literature showed that there are only three reports of ICC associated with AIH, if including the current case.
