Osteoclasts resorb bone by pumping of H+ into a compartment between the cell and the bone surface. Intracellular pH (pHi) homeostasis requires that this acid extrusion, mediated by a vacuolar-type H+ ATPase, be complemented by other acid-base transporters. We investigated acid- extrusion mechanisms of single, freshly isolated, neonatal rat osteoclasts. Cells adherent to glass coverslips were studied in the nominal absence of CO2/HCO3-, using the pH-sensitive dye BCECF and a digital imaging system. Initial pHi averaged 7.31 and was uniform throughout individual cells. Intrinsic buffering power (beta 1) decreased curvilinearly from approximately 25 mM at pHi = 6.4 to approximately 6.0 mM at pHi = 7.4. In all polygonally shaped osteoclasts, and approximately 60% of round osteoclasts (approximately 20% of total), pHi recovery from acid loads was mediated exclusively by Na-H exchange. In these pattern-1 cells, pHi recovery was 95% complete within 200 s, and was blocked by removing Na+, or by applying 1 mM amiloride, 50 microM ethylisopropylamiloride (EIPA), or 50 microM hexamethyleneamiloride (HMA). The apparent K1/2 for HMA ([Na+]o = 150 mM) was 49 nM, and the apparent K1/2 for Na+ was 45 mM. Na-H exchange, corrected for amiloride-insensitive fluxes, was half maximal at pHi 6.73, with an apparent Hill coefficient for intracellular H+ of 2.9. Maximal Na-H exchange averaged 741 microM/s. In the remaining approximately 40% of round osteoclasts (pattern-2 cells), pHi recovery from acid loads was brisk even in the absence of Na+ or presence of amiloride. This Na(+)-independent pHi recovery was blocked by 7-chloro- 4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol (NBD-Cl), a vacuolar-type H+ pump inhibitor. Corrected for NBD-Cl insensitive fluxes, H+ pump fluxes decreased approximately linearly from 96 at pHi 6.8 to 11 microM/s at pHi 7.45. In approximately 45% of pattern-2 cells, Na+ readdition elicited a further pHi recovery, suggesting that H+ pumps and Na-H exchangers can exist simultaneously. We conclude that, under the conditions of our study, most neonatal rat osteoclasts express Na-H exchangers that are probably of the ubiquitous basolateral subtype. Some cells express vacuolar-type H+ pumps in their plasma membrane, as do active osteoclasts in situ.
