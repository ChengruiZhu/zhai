Fatty liver is a major complication of obesity and of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It carries a high risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer. In fatty liver, triglycerides accumulate to high levels in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. Triglycerides are degraded by lipolysis, which has been most studied in fat cells where its three steps are catalyzed by different enzymes. The second step, hydrolysis of diglyceride to a monoglyceride, can be mediated by hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). Patients with genetic deficiency of HSL have fatty liver. In this study, we found that systemic HSL deficient mice developed fatty liver with aging. To study the mechanism of steatosis, we made liver-specific HSL-deficient mice. Surprisingly, these mice had normal liver fat content. We then studied mice with HSL deficiency in adipose tissue. Adipose HSL-deficient mice developed hepatic steatosis to a similar extent as mice with systemic HSL deficiency, showing that adipose HSL deficiency is sufficient to cause fatty liver. Furthermore, like reported HSL-deficient humans, mice with adipose HSL deficiency had systemic insulin resistance, reduced fat mass and inflammation in fat tissue. Each of these is known to promote hepatic steatosis. Livers of adipose HSL-deficient mice showed low levels of hepatic fatty acid (FA) oxidation, of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion and of triglycerides (TG) hydrolase activity, each of which could contribute to fat accumulation in liver. Tissue-selective genetic alterations may help in identifying and understanding the tissues responsible for complex metabolic phenotypes like fatty liver. Our data suggest that at least in mice, strategies for treatment of fatty liver related to HSL deficiency should concentrate on adipose tissue.
