Ten medical files were registered. There were 7 men and 3 women, with a sex ratio of 2.33. The average age was 46 years (range: 29–62 years). It was about traffic road accidents in all cases. Motorcycle–motorcycle and motorcycle–car collision were most frequent. Average admission delay was 7 h (range: 1.5–24 h). Left side was most reached in 8 cases. According to Garden classification, there was type III cervical fracture in 2 cases, type II in 1 case and type IV in 1 case. According to Ender classification, there was type I trochanteric fracture in 3 cases, type VI in 2 cases and type VII in 1 case. According to AO classification, there was type A shaft fracture in 6 cases (A2 in 4 cases and A3 in 2 cases), type B in 2 cases (B1 in 1 case and B2 in 1 case) and type C in 2 cases (C1 in 1 case and C2 in 1 case). Average surgical delay was 28.7 days (range: 11–61 days). For proximal femoral fracture, Moore prosthesis was used in 1 case, blade plate 130° in 2 cases, long Gamma nail in 4 cases, double screwing in 2 cases and dynamic hip screw in 1 case. For shaft femoral fracture, blade plate 95° was used in 3 cases, low compressive plate in 2 cases. Osseous contention was achieved in 4 cases with long Gamma nail and in 1 case with long blade plate 130°. Nonunion of cervical fracture was achieved in 2 cases. The average osseous healing delay was 5.14 months (range: 3–12 months) for proximal femoral fracture and 5 months (range: 3–8 months) for shaft femoral fractures. According to Friedman and Wyman criteria, functional results were good in 4 cases, average in 4 cases and bad in 2 cases. Regarding implants, healing delay showed no statistic difference between one-implant group and two-implant group (
