Epigenetic abnormalities play important roles in the pathogenesis of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Highly expressed class I histone acetyltransferase (HDAC) and hyper-methylation of the promoter region of tumor suppressor genes have been demonstrated in Hodgkin lymphoma. In this paper, we investigated the synergistic effects of combination treatment of chidamide, a selective HDAC inhibitor, and decitabine, a demethylation agent, for HL cell lines and explored a new strategy for treating HL. The apoptosis rates, cell cycle, mitochondrial transmembrane potentials, epigenetic changes and gene expression of HL cell lines treated with chidamide as a single agent and in combination with decitabine were tested. We found that chidamide inhibited the proliferation of HL cells through increased apoptosis. Interestingly, after combined with decitabine, the inhibition rate and apoptotic death in HL cells were significantly increased. Further studies demonstrated that when combined with decitabine the expression of acetylated histone H3 and H3K9 induced by chidamide in HL cells increased, and also the expression of tumor suppressor genes PU.1 and KLF4, which exert inhibition through apoptosis pathway. Therefore, we could come to a conclusion that chidamide and decitabine can synergistically induce apoptosis of Hodgkin lymphoma cells by up-regulating the expression of PU.1 and KLF4. These results provide a new sight in combining two different epigenetic regulatory agents for treating HL.
