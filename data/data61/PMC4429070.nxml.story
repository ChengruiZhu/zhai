Pattern discovery is one of the most important goals of data-driven research. In the biological sciences hierarchical clustering has achieved a position of pre-eminence due to its ability to capture multiple levels of data granularity. Hierarchical clusteringâ€™s visual displays of phylogenetic trees and gene-expression modules are indeed seductive. Despite its merits, hierarchical clustering is greedy by nature and often produces spurious clusters, particularly in the presence of substantial noise. This paper presents a relatively new alternative to hierarchical clustering known as convex clustering. Although convex clustering is more computationally demanding, it enjoys several advantages over hierarchical clustering and other traditional methods of clustering. Convex clustering delivers a uniquely defined clustering path that partially obviates the need for choosing an optimal number of clusters. Along the path small clusters gradually coalesce to form larger clusters. Clustering can be guided by external information through appropriately defined similarity weights. Comparisons to hierarchical clustering demonstrate the superior robustness of convex clustering to noise. Our genetics examples include inference of the demographic history of 52 populations across the world, a more detailed analysis of European demography, and a re-analysis of a well-known breast cancer expression dataset. We also introduce a new algorithm for solving the convex clustering problem. This algorithm belongs to a subclass of MM (minimization-majorization) algorithms known as proximal distance algorithms. The proximal distance convex clustering algorithm is inherently parallelizable and readily maps to modern many-core devices such as graphics processing units (GPUs). Our freely available software,
