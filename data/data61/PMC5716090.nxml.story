Renal angiomyolipomas are found in up to 80% of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) patients. Although these tumours are usually asymptomatic, lesions >3 cm in diameter are prone to bleeding and up to 10% of TSC patients may experience a massive and potentially fatal retroperitoneal haemorrhage. Diagnosis can be complicated because of the initial lack of symptoms and the fat-poor content of atypical renal angiomyolipomas. After diagnosis, tumour growth and the emergence of new tumours must be monitored. Treatment with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors can reduce tumour size and is indicated in patients with TSC-associated renal angiomyolipomas >3 cm in diameter. Imaging-based assessment of kidney disease is essential to the diagnosis and management of patients with TSC. The aims of imaging studies in this context are to detect and characterize tumours, assess and detect the risk of complications and evaluate the response to treatment, especially in patients treated with mTOR inhibitors. A multidisciplinary expert panel developed a series of recommendations based on current evidence and professional experience for imaging studies in adults and children with TSC-associated renal angiomyolipoma. The recommendations cover radiological diagnosis and follow-up of the classic and atypical or fat-poor TSC-associated renal angiomyolipomas, biopsy indications, minimal requirements for radiological requests and reports and recommended technical features and protocols for computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.
