This study monitored the morphological development of embryo, larvae and juvenile yellowtail kingfish, Seriola lalandi, for their aquaculture. The fertilized eggs obtained by natural spawning were spherical shape and buoyant. Fertilized eggs were transparent and had one oil globule in the yolk, with an egg diameter of 1.35 ± 0.04 mm and an oil globule diameter of 0.32 ± 0.02 mm. The fertilized eggs hatched 67–75 h after fertilization in water at 20 ± 0.5°C. The total length (TL) of the hatched larvae was 3.62 ± 0.16 mm. During hatching, the larvae, with their mouth and anus not yet opened. The yolk was completely absorbed 3 days after hatching (DAH), while the TL of post-larvae was 4.72 ± 0.07 mm. At 40 DAH, the juveniles had grown to 30.44 ± 4.07 mm in TL, body depth increased, the body color changed to a black, yellow, and light gray-blue color, and 3–4 vertical stripes appeared. At 45 DAH, the juveniles were 38.67 ± 5.65 mm in TL and 10.10 ± 0.94 mm in body depth. The fish were green with a light orange color, with 7 faint green-brown stripes on the sides of their body. At 87 DAH, the juveniles had grown to 236.11 mm in TL, 217.68 mm in fork length, and 136.5 g in weight. The fish resembled their adult form, with a light yellow-green body color, loss of the pattern on the sides of their body, and a yellow coloration at the tip of the caudal fin.
