 which is associated with human trachoma (3). The studies were extended beyond folliculosis in monkeys and apes to a similar disease widespread among stock rabbits. Its clinical appearance and microscopic changes resemble the spontaneous malady in simians with some minor differences (1). Like the latter, rabbit folliculosis was also shown to be infectious and contagious. In the present paper a bacteriological investigation of the rabbit affection is described. In the experiments undertaken we followed the method used by Noguchi in his studies on trachoma, that is, the different organisms recovered from normal and affected conjunctivae were inoculated into the conjunctivae of selected, quarantined rabbits. Among the bacteria thus isolated from folliculosis tissue a new species was disclosed that brought about conjunctival reactions apparently indistinguishable either from the disease seen in nature or from the experimental infection induced by inoculation of folliculosis tissue. The organism was specifically active in rabbits whether injected subconjunctivally or instilled into the conjunctival sac. Furthermore, the special bacterium has thus far been cultivated only from folliculosis cases and not from other forms of conjunctivitis nor from normal tissues. Finally, specifically pathogenic strains of the identical microorganism have been recovered from rabbits experimentally infected with the bacterium. A distinctive feature of this bacterium is that it is of the same genus as the microorganisms heretofore designated as
