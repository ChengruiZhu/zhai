Humans consist of a few hundred types of specialized-function cells. Spatial and temporal transcriptional regulation of genes is essential for manifestation of cellular phenotypes. Identification of regulatory regions in the genome is central to understanding the mechanism of cell type–specific gene regulation. Recently developed high-throughput sequencing technology and computational analyses allow genome-wide investigation of the genome's chromatin structure. Using the FAIRE-seq technique, we identified the genome's open chromatin regions, which harbor regulatory elements in adipocytes. Open chromatin regions distal to genes' transcription start sites significantly differ among cell types. Multiple cell type–specific open chromatin regions exist near genes regulated during adipocyte differentiation. Computational motif analysis of adipocyte-specific open chromatin regions revealed enrichment of a binding motif for the NFI transcription factor family. These factors bind to the regulatory elements near adipogenic PPARγ, C/EBPα, and aP2 genes and regulate their expression. Overexpression of NFIA in 3T3-L1 cells resulted in robust induction of these genes and lipid droplet formation without differentiation stimulus and knockdown of NFIA or NFIB significantly suppressed both induction of genes and lipid accumulation during differentiation. Our study demonstrates the utility of FAIRE-seq in providing a global view of regulatory elements and in identifying transcriptional regulators of cellular functions.
