Performing a good echocardiographic examination requires intensive training and highly qualified technical staff personnel, which, in many countries, is represented by the Cardiac Sonographer. Being an operator-dependent diagnostic method, a long debate has been held to help identifying the most appropriate curriculum for the training of this professional profile. Although guidelines for the education of the Cardiac Sonographers have been suggested by the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) several years ago and many scientific publications have given credibility, trust and enhance to this professional profile in Italy, this figure is not yet recognized by the National Health System. It is encouraging that in the last decade, national authorities, such as the SIEC (Societ√† Italiana di Ecografia Cardiovascolare), have expressed interest in recognizing the Cardiac Sonographers as professionals in our country. Per their guidelines, the Cardiocirculatory Physiopathology Cardiovascular Perfusion technicians (TFCPCs) seem to be, among the professionals, the most suitable, due to their educational training and the role they play. Taking inspiration from the positive experience of this professional figure in the USA and in the Anglo Saxon countries, it could aims to be a valid support in terms of cost and quality for the Italian health system.
