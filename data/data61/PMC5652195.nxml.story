In order to improve outcomes after breast cancer treatment, it is essential to understand the mechanisms of action of potential therapeutic agents. The effect of fangchinoline (FAN) on migration and apoptosis of human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells and its underlying mechanisms were investigated. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with different concentrations of FAN, growth inhibition rates were measured by MTT assay and morphological changes of apoptotic cells were observed by Hoechst staining. The wound-healing assay was used to determine of the effect of FAN on the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. ELISA was used to detect the expression of MMP-2 and −9 in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with different concentrations of FAN and western blot analysis was used to quantify expression of NF-κβ and Iκβ proteins in the same cells. Our results showed that FAN significantly inhibited the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells in concentration-dependent manner and it induced MDA-MB-231 cell apoptosis. With the high FAN concentrations and long exposure times, the levels of MMP-2 and −9 decreased and the expression of NF-κβ decreased, while the expression of Iκβ protein increased. Based on these results, the antitumor effects of FAN on breast cancer cells can be explained at least partially by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells.
