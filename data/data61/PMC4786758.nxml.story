The non-invasive diagnostic tool for early detection of endometrial cancer still limited. The etiology of this disease is believed to be associated with disharmony hormone production. One predominant factor that regulate hormone production is microRNA (miRNAs). Some studies reported that miRNAs play a significant role in the process carcinogenesis. We have identified 12 of miRNAs that potentially have a role in controlling endometrial carcinogenesis pathways. Further analysis suggested that these miRNA targeted genes that regulate the early development of endometrial cancer. These genes cluster into several functional groups involving a process of angiogenesis, apoptosis, cell cycle, cell proliferation and p53 pathways. Some of the genes are PTEN, GSK3b, and TP53, which are a tumor suppressor that control the process of growth arrest, DNA Repair, and Apoptosis. Upregulation of the miRNA may obstruct the cell ability to control the cell cycle. This study was found three miRNA that plays a role in the development of endometrial cancer. The hsa-miR-495 and hsa-miR-152 were repressed in endometrial cancer compared to normal tissue. The microRNA regulate genes that control proliferation and cell survival. Moreover, hsa-miR-181d was upregulated to control expression a tumor suppressor gene, PTEN to protect the cancer cell from apoptosis. Further investigation to validate the function of the miRNA is a warrant for developing biomarkers of endometrial carcinoma.
