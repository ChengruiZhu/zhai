Rhythmic brain activity is observed in many neural structures and is an inferred critical component of neural processing. In particular, stimulus induced oscillations in the gamma-frequency band (30–80 Hz) are common in several cortical networks. Many experimental and theoretical studies have established the neural mechanisms by which a population of neurons produce and control gamma-band activity. However, the beneficial role, if any, of gamma activity in neural processing is rarely discussed. It is increasingly apparent that gamma oscillatory power increases with subject attention to a sensory scene. Attention is associated with enhanced performance of discrimination tasks, where relevant stimuli compete with distracters. In this study we explore how gamma-band activity serves to enhance the discrimination of stimuli. We use computational models to show that the gamma rhythmicity in a population of spiking neurons drastically reduces the response variability when a preferred stimulus is present. This drop in response variability enhances stimulus discrimination and increases the overall information throughput in sensory cortex. Our results provide a much-needed link between the dynamics of neural populations and the coding tasks they perform, as well as give insight on why—rather than how—attention mediates gamma activity.
