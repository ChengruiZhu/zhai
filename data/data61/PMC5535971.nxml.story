Oxidative stress is a well-described imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the antioxidant defense system of cells and tissues. The overproduction of free radicals damages all components of the cell (proteins, lipids, nucleic acids) and modifies their physiological functions. As widely described, this condition is a biochemical hallmark of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and may dramatically influence the progression of renal impairment and the onset/development of major systemic comorbidities including cardiovascular diseases. This state is exacerbated by exposure of the body to uremic toxins and dialysis, a treatment that, although necessary to ensure patients’ survival, exposes cells to non-physiological contact with extracorporeal circuits and membranes with consequent mitochondrial and anti-redox cellular system alterations. Therefore, it is undeniable that counteracting oxidative stress machinery is a major pharmacological target in medicine/nephrology. As a consequence, in recent years several new naturally occurring compounds, administered alone or integrated with classical therapies and an appropriate lifestyle, have been proposed as therapeutic tools for CKD patients. In this paper, we reviewed the recent literature regarding the “pioneering” in vivo testing of these agents and their inclusion in small clinical trials performed in patients affected by CKD.
