Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive and life-threatening disease. Understanding of PAH prevalence remains limited, but PAH has been reported as a frequent complication in connective tissue diseases. This study estimated prevalence of PAH in patients with connective tissue diseases and prevalence of idiopathic PAH using a systematic review of the literature. We searched PubMed through May 19, 2012 for all studies on prevalence of PAH in patients with connective tissue diseases or prevalence of idiopathic PAH. To be included, studies had to be in English, have humans as subjects, and determine prevalence within a time interval of up to 2 years. Studies only investigating pediatric patients were excluded. Pooled prevalence estimates were calculated. Twenty studies were identified in the review. Seventeen of the 20 studies reported prevalence of PAH in connective tissue diseases and three reported prevalence of idiopathic PAH. The pooled prevalence estimate of idiopathic PAH was 12 cases per million population (95 % CI 5 cases per million to 22 cases per million) with estimates ranging from 5.9 cases per million population to 25 cases per million population. The pooled prevalence estimate of PAH in patients with connective tissue diseases was 13 % (95 % CI, 9.18 % to 18.16 %) with reported estimates ranging from 2.8 % to 32 %. Prevalence of PAH in patients with connective tissue diseases was substantially higher than that of idiopathic PAH based on pooled prevalence estimates. Comparisons of PAH prevalence in persons with connective tissue disease and idiopathic PAH using a large observational study would be helpful in better assessing relative prevalence.
