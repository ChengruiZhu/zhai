Retinal Müller glial cells have already been implicated in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD is characterized by accumulation of toxic amyloid-β peptide (Aβ); the question we raise is as follows: is P2X7 receptor, known to play an important role in several degenerative diseases, involved in Aβ toxicity on Müller cells? Retinal Müller glial cells were incubated with Aβ for 48 h. Cell viability was assessed using the alamarBlue assay and cytotoxicity using the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay. P2X7 receptor expression was highlighted by immunolabeling observed on confocal microscopy and its activation was evaluated by YO-PRO-1 assay. Hoechst 33342 was used to evaluate chromatin condensation, and caspases 8 and 3 activation was assessed using AMC assays. Lipid formulation rich in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) used in Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 was incubated on cells for 15 min prior to Aβ incubation. For the first time, we showed that Aβ induced caspase-independent apoptosis through P2X7 receptor activation on our retinal model. DHA and EPA are polyunsaturated fatty acids recommended in food supplement to prevent AMD. We therefore modulated Aβ cytotoxicity using a lipid formulation rich in DHA and EPA to have a better understanding of the results observed in clinical studies. We showed that fish oil rich in EPA and DHA, in combination with a potent P2X7 receptor antagonist, represents an efficient modulator of Aβ toxicity and that P2X7 could be an interesting therapeutic target to prevent AMD.
