Standard of care therapies for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) may limit morbidity and mortality due to disease-related complications, but they do not delay disease progression. Tolvaptan, a selective vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist, delays the increase in kidney volume (a surrogate marker for disease progression), slows the decline in renal function, and reduces pain in ADPKD patients with relatively preserved renal function. The most common adverse events of tolvaptan are linked to its aquaretic effect, and rare cases of idiosyncratic hepatitis were observed. Additional ongoing studies will determine whether the benefits are sustained over time, whether they can be observed in patients with advanced kidney disease, and whether they can be translated in terms of quality of life and cost/effectiveness parameters. Tolvaptan is currently approved in Europe and several countries throughout the world. In real-life conditions, selection of patients that would be good theoretical candidates to tolvaptan is a key but complex question. Eligibility criteria slightly differ from one country to another, and several models (based on conventional data, genetics, renal volume) were recently proposed to identify patients with evidence or risk of rapid disease progression. Eligible patients will ultimately make the decision to start tolvaptan, after complete information, consideration, and balancing of benefits, adverse events, and risks.
