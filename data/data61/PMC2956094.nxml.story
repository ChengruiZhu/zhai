HCl-demineralized murine lower incisors were implanted intramuscularly into syngeneic BALB/c mice to induce heterotopic osteogenesis. Implants were exposed at the early, preosteogenic stage (4), or at the later, osteogenic stage (12) to the Moloney sarcoma virus (MSV), which within 3â€“4 days results in a sarcoma. The yield of bone induction was determined by weight of dry bone mass following NaOH hydrolysis of soft tissues. To verify the effect of this sarcoma on orthotopic local femoral bone, the dry mass of the tumor-exposed femora was measured and compared with the weight of MSV-unexposed contralateral controls. MSV-sarcoma or cells involved with their spontaneous rejection have a stimulatory effect on the periosteal membrane of the tumor-adjacent femoral bones, increasing their dry mass on average by 18%. No stimulatory effect on heterotopic bone induction was observed when the MSV sarcoma grew during the early, preosteogenic stage (4 onward), but when the tooth matrix had been exposed to such tumor at the already bone-forming stage, (12 onward), the yield of bone induction was enhanced. Thus, it is postulated that lesions induced by MSV during the early, preosteogenic stage inhibit recruitment of osteoprogenitor cells or degrade Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) released by matrix resorbing inflammatory cells, whereas when acting on already existing bone they have a stimulatory effect.
