UV irradiation is the main factor contributing to skin damages that are associated with an excessive production of matrix-degrading metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and a deficient expression of collagens. To date, red ginseng has been revealed to possess many biomedical effects, such as anti-aging, anti-oxidation, and anti-inflammatory. In this study, we prepared the Korean Red Ginseng extracts treated with enzyme (KRGE) and investigated the effects of dietary KRGE on the formation of wrinkles generated by UVB irradiation in hairless mice. It was found that KRGE inhibited the UVB-induced formation of wrinkles, epidermal thickness, and skin dryness in hairless mice. Further results also showed that KRGE attenuated UVB-induced MMP-1 level, while accelerated procollagen type I, transforming growth factor-Î²1 secretion. Interestingly, the expression of profilaggrin and filaggrin in both the epidermis and dermis were decreased due to UVB exposure and reversed by KRGE. The KRGE 0.06% was prior to KRGE 0.24%. In view of these results, which indicated that KRGE protected skin from UVB-induced photodamages, which may not only mediated by regulating of MMP-1 and procollagen type I, but also by increasing the production of profilaggrin and filaggrin. In conclusion, our results suggest that KRGE may be a promising agent for the treatment of skin photodamages. The challenge of KRGE will be expected as cosmeceuticals and nutraceuticals in order to intervene in aging-related degenerative skin changes.
