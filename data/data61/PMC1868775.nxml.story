In a living cell, DNA both is an information carrier and carries out important structural tasks, such as organizing its replication and distributing the chromosomes to the daughter cells. DNA is frequently depicted as an antiparallel double-stranded helix, but DNA may rather be viewed as having a dynamically changing structure. This is because in performing most of these tasks, it is necessary for the DNA helix to become single-stranded locally, or unwound, thereby creating “bubbles” in the double strand, much as what happens when a twisted rope with two strands is untwisted. In the cell, this happens by the aid of the enzymatic machinery, but it may also be observed in experiments when a gradual increase in temperature produces bubbles. Our calculations in producing a melting map are based on temperature changes, but may be viewed as a map of bubble formation tendencies along the genome. In DNA, an opening bubble does not open one base at a time, but rather as a cooperative event, in that several base pairs act in concert to form a bubble, and we use an algorithm that takes this aspect into consideration. We then explore the correlations between the melting map and many known features of the human genome. We also demonstrate the extent of cooperativity, and find that the melting map carries information otherwise not available. Once the melting map is calculated, a number of more detailed studies of relationships to DNA structure and function are made possible, as well as improvements of algorithms for modelling DNA with associated proteins as they occur in the natural cellular environment.
