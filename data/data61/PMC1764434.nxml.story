 Chloroquine (CQ) is a drug that has been widely used for over 40 years for the treatment and prevention of malaria. It is cheap, safe, and, except in areas where resistant malaria parasites exist, effective. However, the spread of resistant malaria parasites in most malarial regions of the world has meant that this drug, and many others, can no longer be relied upon to control disease. New drug candidates are therefore needed, and ideally should be cheap to produce as well as safe and effective. Some research groups are working on potential drug candidates from the aminoquinoline family of compounds, which includes chloroquine. One candidate, AQ-13 (aminoquinoline-13) has already been studied in animal and in vitro experiments, and seemed to be a good candidate for further testing in humans. Therefore, as the first stage in evaluating AQ-13 further, this group of researchers carried out a Phase I trial in healthy humans. The researchers specifically wanted to compare how often people given AQ-13, as compared to those given CQ, had side effects, and to find out how AQ-13 is handled in the body (i.e., how quickly the compound is taken into the bloodstream, gets broken down, and how it affects normal body functions). These sorts of studies do not tell researchers anything about the efficacy of the drug in treating malaria, but the results are absolutely essential before trials can be done that do test efficacy in people with malaria. 126 healthy volunteers were recruited into the study, and each received capsules containing a different dosage of either AQ-13 or CQ. Side effects data were collected for four weeks after the drugs were given. The most common side effects experienced by volunteers in the trial were headache, light-headedness, dizziness, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Overall, the frequencies of such events were roughly similar among people receiving AQ-13 and those receiving CQ, but due to the small numbers of participants in the trial, it is not possible to say whether any observed differences in frequency of side effects between the two groups are meaningful or not. The data collected in this trial also showed that both AQ-13 and CQ were absorbed into the bloodstream in a similar way, but AQ-13 was absorbed more slowly than CQ. On ECG testing, both compounds increased the QT interval (part of the heart's electrical cycle, and used as a measure of heart function), particularly at high dosage levels, and volunteers given CQ experienced a greater increase in QT interval than those receiving AQ-13. No volunteers experienced any symptoms related to heart function. The researchers concluded that on the basis of these data, AQ-13 could proceed to further trials to evaluate the drug's efficacy in treating clinical malaria.
