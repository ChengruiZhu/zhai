Teeth, hair follicles, and skin ducts (including mammary and sweat glands) are initially formed in the embryo as slight thickenings of a flat epithelium that are called placodes. These then invaginate to form dimples or pits that make the characteristic structures found in the adult. While some invagination mechanisms are well-studied and it is recognized that invagination is one of the basic motifs needed to construct the body, the physical events that lead placodes to invaginate are unclear. Here, we analyzed the events required to form tooth placodes and identified a novel mechanism: we showed that the superficial layer of the placode contracts to pucker the underlying epithelium, ultimately forcing it deep into the underlying mesenchyme. We demonstrated that the superficial tissue generates contractile forces and that the mechanical tension deforms nuclei in this tissue. This allowed us to map the tension not only in developing teeth, but also in hair follicles and mammary glands, revealing similar patterns of nuclear distortion in different tissues and suggesting the existence of a shared mechanism of invagination. We also labelled individual cells and tracked them in real time, showing that the tissue contracts via cell intercalation, with some cells remaining anchored to the basal layer of the epithelium while trying to migrate toward the placode centre. Overall, our results describe the dynamic rearrangements that take place during tooth placode formation and suggest that similar processes occur in other organs that are formed by invagination of stratified placodes.
