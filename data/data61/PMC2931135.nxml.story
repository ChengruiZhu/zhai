Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a clinical entity characterized by massive loss of urinary protein leading to hypoproteinemia and edema. This prospective cross sectional study was performed on 44 children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS). The objectives were to study the clinical and biochemical parameters at the time of diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome and to study the histopathological distribution of different subtypes of INS and drug response pattern. There were 29 (66%) males and 15 females (34%). The mean age of NS was 4.87Â±3.24 years. Facial edema was found in 42 (95%), microscopic hematuria in 10 (23%), gross hematuria in 2 (4.5%), and hypertension in 5 (11.2%) of patients. In 17 children who underwent biopsy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was the most common pathologic finding (41%). Other subtypes included minimal change in three (18%), membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis in 1(5.8%), diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis in 2 (11.6%), membranous glomerulonephritis in 1 (5.8%), and diffuse mesangial proliferation in 3 (17.5%) of cases. At the time of hospital admission, peritonitis were present in five (11.4%), pneumonia and upper respiratory infection (sinusitis) in eight (18%), cellulitis in two (4.5%). Among 44 children with NS, 29 (66%) were steroid sensitive cases, nine (20.5%) were steroid resistant and six (13.5%) were steroid dependent. Among patients with steroid sensitive NS, 37% were without relapsers, 38.8% frequent relapsers and 26.4% were infrequent relapsers. These results suggest that there are differences between season of incidence, response to treatment with corticosteroid and pathologic findings in our study and other studies in Iran and other countries.
