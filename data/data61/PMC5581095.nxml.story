Breast cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed and death-related cancers in women worldwide. Mammography is routinely used for screening and invasive examinations such as painful tissue biopsies were recommended for patients with abnormal screening outcomes. However, a considerable proportion of these cases turn out to be benign lesions. Thus, novel non-invasive approach for discriminating breast cancer from benign lesions is desirable. Herein, we applied a high-throughput ultra performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS) analysis to determine the oxidative DNA damage biomarker, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2â€²-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) in urine samples from 60 patients with early-stage breast cancer (stage I, II), 51 patients with benign breast diseases and 73 healthy volunteers. We demonstrated that the concentration of urinary 8-oxodG in patients with early-stage breast cancer was significantly higher not only than that in healthy controls, but also than that in patients with benign breast diseases, whereas no significant difference of urinary 8-oxodG level was observed between benign breast diseases group and healthy control group. Moreover, there was significant difference between early-stage breast cancer group and non-cancerous group which consisted of benign breast diseases patients and healthy controls. Besides, logistic regression analysis and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were also performed. Our findings indicate that the marked increase of 8-oxodG in urine may serve as a potential biomarker for the risk estimation, early screening and detection of breast cancer, particularly for discriminating early-stage breast cancer from benign lesions.
