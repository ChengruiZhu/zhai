Anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies were raised against three protective monoclonal antibodies, each with specificity for the variable antigen type (VAT) of a clone of Trypanosoma rhodesiense. The IgG1 fractions of each were pooled and administered to BALB/c mice 3-4 wk before homologous challenge. The course of primary parasitemia was altered in 19 of 30 anti-Id-treated animals. The immunity was manifested as either: (a) complete protection, (b) reduced parasitemia, or (c) selection against parasites bearing the original VAT. The three idiotypes (Id) were found in variable levels in serum during the course of infection in control animals. However, in all anti-Id-treated mice that displayed immunity, one Id in particular (7H11) was detectable much earlier in infection and in higher levels than in control mice or anti-Id-treated, nonimmune mice. Six of nine mice treated with the anti- 7H11 Id alone also displayed immunity, manifested in this case exclusively as selection against parasites bearing the original VAT. The effect was again associated with the more rapid appearance of the Id after infection. Specificity of the anti-Id-induced immunity was supported by the failure of anti-7H11 Id treatment to alter the course of infection with a heterologous clone of T. rhodesiense. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the antigen-independent induction of antimicrobial immunity using anti-Id antibodies.
