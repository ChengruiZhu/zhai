The chemokines are a large family of cytokines that control the recruitment of leukocytes in immune and inflammatory responses. We describe the isolation of a novel murine CC chemokine that, based on its biological and structural features, we have named monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-5. MCP-5 mapped to the CC chemokine cluster on mouse chromosome 11 and was most closely related to human MCP-1 in structure (66% amino acid identity). Purified recombinant MCP-5 protein was a potent chemoattractant for peripheral blood monocytes, was only weakly active on eosinophils at high doses, and was inactive on neutrophils. MCP-5 induced a calcium flux in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, but not in purified murine eosinophils or neutrophils. Consistent with these results, MCP-5 induced a calcium flux in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells transfected with human and murine CCR2, a CC chemokine receptor expressed on monocytes. MCP-5 did not induce a calcium flux in HEK-293 cells transfected with CCR1, CCR3, or CCR5. Constitutive expression of MCP-5 mRNA was detected predominantly in lymph nodes, and its expression was markedly induced in macrophages activated in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, MCP-5 expression was upregulated in the lungs of mice following aerosolized antigen challenge of sensitized mice, and during the host response to infection with
