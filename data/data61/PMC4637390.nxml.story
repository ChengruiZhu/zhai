Adult male Albino rats were randomised into four equal groups (seven rats in each group). In group 1 (sham group) the rats underwent the same anaesthetic and surgical procedure as the control group except for ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery; group 2 (control group) rats were subjected to regional ischaemia for 25 minutes by ligation of LAD coronary artery and reperfusion for 2 hours; group 3 (control vehicle group) rats received (normal saline) vehicle of valsartan via IP injection and were subjected to regional ischaemia for 25 minutes by ligation of LAD coronary artery and reperfusion for two hours; group 4 (valsartan treated group) rats were pretreated with valsartan 10 mg/kg IP 30 minutes before ligation of LAD coronary artery. At the end of the experiment, blood samples were taken by direct cardiac puncture for the measurement of plasma levels of troponin T (cTnT) and serum levels for both malondialdehyde MDA and glutathione GSH. After blood sampling, the heart was removed and divided into two parts; the apex was used for histopathological examination, and the remaining part was used for the measurement of cardiac tissue levels of tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 10 (IL-10), cysteine aspartic acid-protease 3 (caspase-3), and BCL2-associated X protein (BAX), after removal of the remaining blood clots and aorta.
