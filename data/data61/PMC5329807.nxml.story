The association between GSTP1 A>G polymorphism and chemosensitivity of osteosarcoma is controversial according to previously published studies. We conducted this meta-analysis to further investigate the role of GSTP1 A>G genetic variation in response to chemotherapy resistance in patients with osteosarcoma. Using the electronic databases of Pubmed, Wanfang and CNIK were searched to find the studies related to the GSTP1 A>G polymorphism and chemosensitivity of osteosarcoma. The genotype of AA, AG and GG were extracted from the chemotherapy sensitivity and chemotherapy resistance group. The association between GSTP1 A>G polymorphism and chemosensitivity was calculated by STATA11.0 software. The correlation between GSTP1 A>G polymorphism and chemotherapy response was assessed by odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (95%CI). Four studies with 681 cases were finally included in this meta-analysis. The pooled data indicated that there was no significant association between GSTP1 A>G polymorphism and chemosensitivity in patients with osteosarcoma [Homozygous genetic model (GG vs AA): OR=0.53, 95%CI: 0.25-1.12, P=0.10; recessive genetic model (GG vs GA+AA): OR=0.61, 95%CI:0.34-1.11,P=0.11; and dominant genetic model (GG+AG vs AA): OR=0.67, 95%CI:0.42-1.07,P=0.10]. No correlation between GSTP1 A>G polymorphism and chemosensitivity was found according to this present meta-analysis. However, the small number of cases in each included study and significant statistical heterogeneity among the trials means the conclusion should be regarded as conservative.
