 gene product merlin is a tumour suppressor, which in addition to inhibiting cell proliferation regulates cell morphology. The morphogenic properties of merlin may play a role in tumour suppression, as patient-derived tumour cells demonstrate cytoskeletal abnormalities. However, it is still unclear how these functions are linked. The N-terminal FERM-domain of merlin is highly homologous to the oncogenic protein ezrin, while the C-termini are less conserved, suggesting that the opposite effect of the proteins on proliferation could be mediated by their distinct C-terminal regions. In this study we characterize the role of the most C-terminal residues of merlin in the regulation of proliferation, cytoskeletal organization, phosphorylation and intramolecular associations. In addition to the two full-length merlin isoforms and truncating mutations found in patients, we focused on the evolutionally conserved C-terminal residues 545-547, also harbouring disease-causing mutations. We demonstrate that merlin induces cell extensions, which result from impaired retraction of protrusions rather than from increased formation of filopodia. The residues 538-568 were found particularly important for this morphogenic activity. The results further show that both merlin isoforms are able to equally inhibit proliferation, whereas C-terminal mutants affecting residues 545-547 are less effective in growth suppression. This study demonstrates that the C-terminus contains distinct but overlapping functional domains important for regulation of the morphogenic activity, intramolecular associations and cell proliferation.
