The microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) promotes melanocyte differentiation and cell cycle arrest. Paradoxically, MITF also promotes melanoma survival and proliferation, acting like a lineage survival oncogene. Thus, it is critically important to understand the mechanisms that regulate MITF activity in melanoma cells. SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling enzymes are multiprotein complexes composed of one of two related ATPases, BRG1 or BRM, and 9-12 associated factors (BAFs). We previously determined that BRG1 interacts with MITF to promote melanocyte differentiation. However, it was unclear whether SWI/SNF enzymes regulate the expression of different classes of MITF target genes in melanoma. In this study, we characterized SWI/SNF subunit expression in melanoma cells and observed down-regulation of BRG1 or BRM, but not concomitant loss of both ATPases. Re-introduction of BRG1 in BRG1 deficient SK-MEL5 cells enhanced expression of differentiation specific MITF target genes and resistance to cisplatin. Down-regulation of the single ATPase, BRM, in SK-MEL5 cells inhibited expression of both differentiation specific and pro-proliferative MITF target genes and inhibited tumorigenicity in vitro. Our data suggest that heterogeneous SWI/SNF complexes composed of either the BRG1 or BRM subunit promote expression of distinct and overlapping MITF target genes and that at least one ATPase is required for melanoma tumorigenicity.
