Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is considered to be a necessary, but not sufficient, causal agent of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). All forms of KS are characterized by the proliferation of spindle-shaped cells, and most (>90%) spindle cells from KS lesions are latently infected with KSHV. During KSHV latency, only a few viral genes are expressed. Among those latent genes, the ORF 73 gene encodes the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA), which is critical for the establishment and maintenance of the latent KSHV infection. Much evidence suggests that many cytokines can increase the frequency and aggressiveness of KS. In this study, a microarray analysis of KS and normal tissues revealed that multiple cytokines and cytokine receptors are regulated by KSHV latent infection. Of special interest, IL-22R1 transcript level was found to be down-regulated in the KS tissue. To study the possible regulation of IL-22R1 by LANA, the IL-22R1 promoter was constructed and found to contain a LANA-binding site (LBS). LANA was demonstrated to down-regulate IL-22R1 expression via direct binding to the LBS located within the IL-22R1 promoter region. Furthermore, KSHV latently infected cells showed an impaired response to IL-22 stimulation. These results suggest that LANA can regulate host factor expression by directly binding to a cis-acting element within the factor's promoter to benefit latent viral infection and suppression of the antiviral immune response.
