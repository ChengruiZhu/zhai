Conventional radiography has shown limitation in acquiring image of the ATM region, thus, computed tomography (CT) scanning has been the best option to the present date for diagnosis, surgical planning and treatment of bone lesions, owing to its specific properties. Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate images of simulated bone lesions at the head of the mandible by multislice CT. Material and methods: Spherical lesions were made with dental spherical drills (sizes 1, 3, and 6) and were evaluated by using multislice CT (64 rows), by two observers in two different occasions, deploying two protocols: axial, coronal, and sagittal images, and parasagittal images for pole visualization (anterior, lateral, posterior, medial and superior). Acquired images were then compared with those lesions in the dry mandible (gold standard) to evaluate the specificity and sensibility of both protocols. Statistical methods included: Kappa statistics, validity test and chi-square test. Results demonstrated the advantage of associating axial, coronal, and sagittal slices with parasagittal slices for lesion detection at the head of the mandible. Results: There was no statistically significant difference between the types of protocols regarding a particular localization of lesions at the poles. Conclusions: Protocols for the assessment of the head of the mandible were established to improve the visualization of alterations of each of the poles of the mandible's head. The anterior and posterior poles were better visualized in lateral-medial planes while lateral, medial and superior poles were better visualized in the anterior-posterior plane.
