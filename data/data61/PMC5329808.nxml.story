Intra-abdominal adhesions are the most frequently occurring postoperative complication following abdomino-pelvic surgery. Abdominal and pelvic surgery can lead to peritoneal adhesion formation causing infertility, chronic pelvic pain, and intestinal obstruction. Laparoscopy today is considered the gold standard of care in the treatment of several abdominal pathologies as well as in a wide range of vascular diseases. Laparoscopy has several advantages in comparison to open surgery. These include rapid recovery times, shorter hospitalisation, reduced postoperative pain, as well as cosmetic benefits. The technological improvements in this particular surgical field along with the development of modern techniques and the acquisition of specific laparoscopic skills have allowed for its wider utilization in operations with fully intracorporeal anastomoses. Postoperative adhesions are caused by aberrant peritoneal healing and are the leading cause of postoperative bowel obstruction. The use of anti-adherence barriers is currently being advocated for their prevention. The outcome of the investigation showed adhesion formation inhibition without direct detrimental effects on anastomotic healing. Poor anasto-motic healing can provoke adhesions even in the presence of anti-adhesion barriers. This review gives a short overview on the current evidence on the pathophysiology and prevention of peritoneal adhesions.
