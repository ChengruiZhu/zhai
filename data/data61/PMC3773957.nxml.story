Oxidative stress, an imbalance between reactive oxygen species production and antioxidative defense activity, is believed to have a role in the development and pathogenesis of nasal polyps (NPs). Based on this assumption, several known oxidants and antioxidants have been studied in patients with NPs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between oxidative stress parameters with a more valid and reliable method in patients with NPs. Seventy-three patients with NPs, septal deviations and middle concha hypertrophies were recruited. Patients were divided into two groups; group 1 (n = 38) consisted of patients with NPs, and group 2 (n = 35) included patients with septal deviations and middle concha hypertrophies. Polyp specimens were taken from all patients who underwent endoscopic surgery for NPs. Control specimens were obtained from patients who underwent an operation for septoplasty or middle concha hypertrophy. Blood and tissue samples were obtained to assess total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant status (TAS) and oxidative stress index (OSI). Compared to group 2, group 1 had significantly higher TOS and OSI and lower TAS levels both in serum and tissue samples (p < 0.001 for all). In group 1, tissue TOS and OSI levels were significantly higher, and TAS levels were significantly lower than in serum (p < 0.001 for all), whereas no significant difference was found in TOS, OSI and TAS levels either in serum or tissue samples in group 2 (p = 1.0; p = 1; p = 0.208, respectively). In group 1, serum OSI levels were significantly correlated with age (r = 0.442, p = 0.005). Our study demonstrated that oxidative stress, both in serum and tissues in patients with NPs, was higher than in patients without NPs. Our study differs from previous studies in that we used a more reliable method that measures both TOS and TAS.
