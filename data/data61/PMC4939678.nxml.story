Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tumors has been heralded as a promising tool to identify ‘actionable’ abnormalities susceptible to therapies targeting these mutated genes. Inhibiting the oncoprotein expressed from a single dominant mutated gene (oncogene) forms the basis for the success of most of the targeted gene therapies approved in the last several years. The well over 20 FDA-approved kinase inhibitors for cancer treatment are examples [Janne et al.: Nat Rev Drug Discov 2009;8: 709–723]. These and other similar agents in development might prove effective therapies for tumors originating from tissues other than those for which these drugs are currently approved. Finding such mutations in tumors of patients through NGS is being aggressively pursued by patients and their oncologists. For identified mutated tumor suppressor genes (TSG) the challenge is really the opposite. Rather than inhibiting the action of an oncoprotein, targeting would involve restoring the activity of the wild-type (WT) TSG function [Knudson: Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1971;249: 912–915]. Here, a case is reported that illustrates the implications of a mutated TSG (BRIP1) identified by NGS as potentially actionable. In such cases, measuring allelic mutation frequency potentially allows for the identification of tumors where the loss of heterozygosity of a TSG exists. Without substantial loss of expression of the WT TSG product, it would seem very unlikely that ‘replacing’ a WT TSG product that is not a lost product would be a useful therapy.
