Today, electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs) are widely used as a replacement to portal films for patient position verification, but the image quality is not always optimal. The general aim of this study was to optimize the acquisition parameters of an amorphous silicon EPID commercially available for clinical use in radiation therapy with the view to avoid saturation of the system. Special attention was paid to selection of the parameter corresponding to the number of rows acquired between accelerator pulses (NRP) for various beam energies and dose rates. The image acquisition system (IAS2) has been studied, and portal image acquisition was found to be strongly dependent on the accelerator pulse frequency. This frequency is set for each “energy — dose rate” combination of the linear accelerator. For all combinations, the image acquisition parameters were systematically changed to determine their influence on the performances of the Varian aS500 EPID system. New parameters such as the maximum number of rows (MNR) and the number of pulses per frame (NPF) were introduced to explain portal image acquisition theory. Theoretical and experimental values of MNR and NPF were compared, and they were in good agreement. Other results showed that NRP had a major influence on detector saturation and dose per image. A rule of thumb was established to determine the optimum NRP value to be used. This practical application was illustrated by a clinical example in which the saturation of the aSi EPID was avoided by NRP optimization. Moreover, an additional study showed that image quality was relatively insensitive to this parameter.
