Lung injury is characterized by diffuse lung inflammation, alveolar-capillary destruction, and alveolar flooding, resulting in respiratory failure. Polydexyribonucleotide (PDRN) has an anti-inflammatory effect, decreasing inflammatory cytokines, and suppressing apoptosis. Thus, we investigated its efficacy in the treatment of lung injury, which was induced in rats using lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Rats were randomly divided into three groups according to sacrifice time, and each group split into control, lung injury-induced, and lung injury-induced + PDRN-treated groups. Rats were sacrificed 24 h and 72 h after PDRN administration, according to each group. Lung injury was induced by intratracheal instillation of LPS (5 mg/kg) in 0.2 mL saline. Rats in PDRN-treated groups received a single intraperitoneal injection of 0.3 mL distilled water including PDRN (8 mg/kg), 1 h after lung injury induction. Percentages of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive, cleaved caspase-3-, -8-, and -9-positive cells, the ratio of Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) to B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and expressions of inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-Î±, interleukin-6) were decreased by PDRN treatment in the LPS-induced lung injury rats. Therefore, treatment with PDRN reduced lung injury score. This anti-apoptotic effect of PDRN can be ascribed to the enhancing effect of PDRN on adenosine A
