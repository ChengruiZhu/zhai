Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a monocyte-derived protein cytotoxic or cytostatic for some tumor cell lines. Here we show that highly purified E. coli-derived recombinant human TNF stimulated the growth of human FS- 4 diploid fibroblasts. Stimulation of cell growth was demonstrable at a TNF concentration of 10 pg/ml (3 X 10(-13) M). Maximal stimulation was attained at TNF concentrations of 10 ng/ml (3 X 10(-10) M) or higher. Growth-stimulatory activity of TNF was inhibited by an mAb neutralizing the cytotoxic activity of TNF. Growth stimulation was not inhibited by another mAb specific for TNF, lacking neutralizing activity for the cytotoxic activity of TNF. Growth stimulation by TNF was more marked and more sustained in the presence of greater than or equal to 10% FCS than in medium with less than or equal to 5% FCS. Addition of TNF to confluent FS-4 cultures also produced a marked stimulation of cell growth in the presence of fresh FCS, while a much less marked stimulation was seen in the absence of FCS. Stimulation of confluent cultures by TNF in serum-free medium was enhanced by insulin, suggesting that insulin or insulin-like growth factor(s) in the serum can act synergistically with TNF in producing growth stimulation. While the growth-stimulatory effects of TNF and insulin were synergistic, the actions of TNF and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were less than additive, suggesting that TNF and EGF may activate identical or similar pathways. We conclude that stimulation of cell growth is probably a physiological function of TNF, and that the cytotoxic and cytostatic actions of TNF may be the result of an anomalous growth signal transduction in neoplastic cells lacking the constraints of normal growth control mechanisms.
