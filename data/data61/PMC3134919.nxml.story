A developmental model of epidemiological transition for elderly suicide rates with four sequential stages has been developed to simultaneously explain cross-national variations in elderly suicide rates, trends over time for elderly suicide rates and age-associated trends in suicides rates reported in the literature. This model was supported by demonstration of a curvilinear (inverted U-shaped curve) relationship between elderly suicide rates and socio-economic status fitting the quadratic equation Y = A + BX - CX2 (where Y is the suicide rate, X is the socio-economic status and A,B, and C are constants) in both sexes. However, this relationship was derived from a cross-sectional study and, therefore, only an association can be inferred. One way to substantiate this further would be to examine the above curvilinear relationship between suicide rates and socio-economic status in a series of younger age-bands because a large part of the epidemiological transition hypothesis was contingent upon the impact of socio-economic status, through a series of mechanisms, on life expectancy. It was hypothesized that the curvilinear (inverted U-shaped curve) relationship between suicide rates and socio-economic status would be absent in younger age-bands and may be present in the younger age-bands closer to the older age-bands (i.e. 45-54 years and 55-64 years).
