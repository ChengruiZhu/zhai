Two novel methods for detecting cardiac quiescent phases from B-mode echocardiography using a correlation-based frame-to-frame deviation measure were developed. Accurate knowledge of cardiac quiescence is crucial to the performance of many imaging modalities, including computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA). Synchronous electrocardiography (ECG) and echocardiography data were obtained from 10 healthy human subjects (four male, six female, 23â€“45 years) and the interventricular septum (IVS) was observed using the apical four-chamber echocardiographic view. The velocity of the IVS was derived from active contour tracking and verified using tissue Doppler imaging echocardiography methods. In turn, the frame-to-frame deviation methods for identifying quiescence of the IVS were verified using active contour tracking. The timing of the diastolic quiescent phase was found to exhibit both inter- and intra-subject variability, suggesting that the current method of CTCA gating based on the ECG is suboptimal and that gating based on signals derived from cardiac motion are likely more accurate in predicting quiescence for cardiac imaging. Two robust and efficient methods for identifying cardiac quiescent phases from B-mode echocardiographic data were developed and verified. The methods presented in this paper will be used to develop new CTCA gating techniques and quantify the resulting potential improvement in CTCA image quality.
