The disulfiram and copper complex (DSF:Cu) has emerged as a potent radiosensitising anti-cancer agent. The ability of copper to stabilise DSF in a planar conformation and to inhibit DNA replication enzymes stimulated our investigation of the effect of DSF:Cu on cell cycle regulation. Flow cytometry and immunoblotting were used to assess the effect of DSF:Cu on cell cycle progression of the neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-BE(2c) and the glioma cell line UVW. Treatment with 0.1 and 0.3 μM DSF:Cu inhibited DNA synthesis in SK-N-BE(2c) and UVW cells, respectively. The increased potency of ionising radiation treatment induced by DSF:Cu and/or gemcitabine was determined by clonogenic assay. Treatment with 0.3 μM DSF:Cu resulted in greater radiation kill, exemplified by dose enhancement factor values of 2.64 and 2.84 in SK-N-BE(2c) and UVW cells, respectively. Although DSF:Cu failed to sensitise S phase cells to irradiation, we observed that DSF:Cu radiosensitisation was potentiated by the S phase-specific cytotoxic drug gemcitabine. The efficacy of the combination treatment consisting of DSF:Cu, gemcitabine and ionising radiation was schedule-dependent. Together, these results describe cell cycle specific radiosensitisation by DSF:Cu. The well-established toxicity profiles of DSF and gemcitabine should facilitate their evaluation as a combination treatment in patients undergoing radiotherapy.
