Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor can be found in more than 80% of patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma and is associated with shorter survival. In this work, we evaluated the feasibility of adding nimotuzumab to chemoradiation in locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Twenty-three patients with clinically staged T3-4 or any node-positive disease were enrolled. They were scheduled to receive one cycle of induction chemotherapy followed by intensity-modulated radiotherapy, weekly administration of nimotuzumab and concurrent chemotherapy. Results showed that all patients received a full course of radiotherapy, 19(82.6%)patients completed the scheduled neoadjuvant and concurrent chemotherapy, and 22(95.7%) patients received =6 weeks of nimotuzumab. During the period of concurrent chemoradiation and nimotuzumab, grade 3-4 toxicities occurred in 14(60.9%) patients: 8 (34.8%) had grade 3-4 oral mucositis, 6(26.1%) had grade 3 neutropenia, and 1(4.3%) had grade 3 dermatitis. No acne-like rash was observed. With a median follow-up of 24.1 months, the 2-year progression-free survival and overall survival were 83.5% and 95.0%, respectively. In conclusion, concurrent administration of chemoradiation and nimotuzumab was well-tolerated with good compliance. Preliminary clinical outcome data appear encouraging with favorable normal tissue toxicity results comparing with historical data of concurrent chemoradiation plus cetuximab.
