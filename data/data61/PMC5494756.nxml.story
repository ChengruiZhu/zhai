We studied the relationship between the polymorphisms of −800G/A and +915G/C in transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) gene and lung cancer susceptibility. The sequence-specific primer polymerase chain reaction (PCR-SSP) technique was used to test 156 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients that were selected as the observation group and 156 patients with pneumonia and tuberculosis that were selected as the control group (age and gender 1:1 proximal matching principle) and the polymorphisms of the first exon −800G/A and +915G/C TGF-β1 genes. The expression of TGF-β1 levels in peripheral blood was detected using ELISA. The proportion of −800G/A gene AA subtype and A allelic gene in the observation group was significantly higher than that in the control group, while the proportion of +915G/C gene CC subtype and C allelic gene was also significantly higher than that in the control group (P<0.05). The cancer risk [odds ratio (OR)] of patients with A allelic gene in −800G/A gene was 4.8 (95% CI=2.563–6.537, P<0.05), while the cancer risk (OR) of patients with C allelic gene in +915G/C gene was 4.7 (95% CI=2.317–5.864, P<0.05). The serum TGF-β1 expression levels of −800G/A gene AA subtype in the observation group was significantly higher than the GG type, GA type and the control group, while the TGF-β1 level of +915G/C gene CC subtype was significantly higher than the GG type, GC type and the control group (P<0.05). Therefore, the polymorphisms of −800G/A and +915G/C in TGF-β1 gene are closely related to the lung cancer susceptibility.
