In clinic, strontium ranelate (SrR) is a useful drug to treat osteoporosis by orally taken method, but some side effect appeared in recent years. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of SrR on cells by direct application, to study the possibility of local application of this drug. Qualitative ALP staining, quantitative ALP activity assay, alizarin red staining, realtime PCR and westernblot assay were used to evaluate the osteogenesis ability of SrR under normal or osteogenic induction environment of ovariectomy bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (OVX-BMSCs). The angiogenesis ability of SrR was studied by immunofluorescence staining of CD31 and vWF of OVX-BMSCs under angiogenesis induction environment, transwell, tubeformation and realtime PCR assay of HUVECs. Signaling pathway of PI3K/AKT/mTOR was also studied. The result demonstrated that SrR could enhance proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of OVX-BMSCs. The osteogenesis effect of SrR has been proved by the better performed of ALP activity, alizarin red staining and the remarkable up-regulation of ALP, Col-I, Runx2, OCN, BMP-2, BSP, OPG of the OVX-BMSCs, and reduction of RANKL. In addition, SrR promotes angiogenesis differentiation of both OVX-BMSCs and HUVECs. Higher intensity of immunostaining of CD31 and vWF, better result of transwell and tubeformation assay could be observed in SrR treated group, and increasing mRNA levels of VEGF and Ang-1 in the OVX-BMSCs, VEGF in HUVECs were learnt. Signaling pathway assay showed that PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway was involved in this SrR triggered angiogenesis procedure. The thrombosis marker ET-1, PAI-1 and t-PA were up-regulated, but no significant differences for low concentration (<0.5mM). The concentration between 0.25-0.5mM may be more appropriate for local application, and locally application of SrR could be considered as a promising way for bone regeneration.
