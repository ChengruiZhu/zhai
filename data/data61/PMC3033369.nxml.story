The treatment of HCV infection poses a major global health-care challenge today. The current standard of care, combination therapy with interferon and ribavirin, works in only about half of the patients treated. Because no alternatives are available yet for patients in whom combination therapy fails, identifying ways to improve response to combination therapy is critical. Increasing exposure to ribavirin does improve response but is associated with the severe side-effect, anemia. One way to maximize treatment response therefore is to increase ribavirin exposure to levels just below where anemia becomes intolerable. A second way is to supplement combination therapy with growth hormones, such as erythropoietin, that increase the production of red blood cells (erythrocytes) and compensate for ribavirin-induced anemia. Rational optimization of combination therapy thus relies on a quantitative description of ribavirin-induced anemia, which is currently lacking. Here, we develop a model of the population dynamics of erythrocytes in individuals exposed to ribavirin that quantitatively describes ribavirin-induced anemia. Model predictions capture several independent observations of ribavirin-induced anemia in HCV patients undergoing combination therapy, estimate the threshold ribavirin exposure beyond which anemia becomes intolerable, suggest guidelines for the usage of growth hormones, and facilitate rational optimization of therapy.
