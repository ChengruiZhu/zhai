Influenza viruses are respiratory pathogens and can cause severe disease. The best protection against influenza is provided by annual vaccination. These vaccines are produced in embryonated chicken eggs or using continuous animal cell lines. The latter processes are more flexible and scalable to meet the growing global demand. However, virus production in cell cultures is more expensive. Hence, further research is needed to make these processes more cost-effective and robust. We studied influenza virus replication dynamics to identify factors that limit the virus yield in adherent Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. The cell cycle stage of MDCK cells had no impact during early infection. Yet, our results showed that the influenza virus RNA synthesis levels out already 4 h post infection at a time when viral genome segments are exported from the nucleus. Nevertheless, virus release occurred at a constant rate in the following 16 h. Thereafter, the production of infectious viruses dramatically decreased, but cells continued to produce particles contributing to the hemagglutination (HA) titer. The majority of these particles from the late phase of infection were deformed or broken virus particles as well as large membranous structures decorated with viral surface proteins. These changes in particle characteristics and morphology need to be considered for the optimization of influenza virus production and vaccine purification steps. Moreover, our data suggest that in order to achieve higher cell-specific yields, a prolonged phase of viral RNA synthesis and/or a more efficient release of influenza virus particles is required.
