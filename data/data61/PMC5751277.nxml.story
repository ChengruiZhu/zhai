Given the importance of the extracellular medium during tissue formation, it was wise to develop an artificial structure that mimics the extracellular matrix while having improved physico-chemical properties. That is why the choice was focused on gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA), an inexpensive biocompatible hydrogel. Physicochemical and mechanical properties were improved by the incorporation of nanoparticles developed from two innovative fabrication processes: High shear fluid and low frequencies/high frequencies ultrasounds. Both rapeseed nanoliposomes and nanodroplets were successfully incorporated in the GelMA networks during the photo polymerization process. The impact on polymer microstructure was investigated by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and enzymatic degradation investigations. Mechanical stability and viscoelastic tests were conducted to demonstrate the beneficial effect of the functionalization on GelMA hydrogels. Adding nanoparticles to GelMA improved the surface properties (porosity), tuned swelling, and degradability properties. In addition, we observed that nanoemulsion didn’t change significantly the mechanical properties to shear and compression solicitations, whereas nanoliposome addition decreased Young’s modulus under compression solicitations. Thus, these ways of functionalization allow controlling the design of the material by choosing the type of nanoparticle (nanoliposome or nanoemulsion) in function of the application.
