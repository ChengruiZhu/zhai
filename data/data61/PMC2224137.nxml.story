 are typical cilia, but no ciliary rootlets connect their bases. 2. The "neuromotor fibrils" are composed of filaments 21 mµ in diameter. At the point of junction of the filaments with the peripheral ciliary fibrils a granular structure 65 to 90 mµ in diameter is seen which has dense central and peripheral zones separated by a less dense layer. Information on the interconnection of organelles is expanded. 3. A system of subpellicular fibrils is described. The external fibrillar system described by others could not be found. 4. The motorium is shown to be a mass of intertwining rootlet filaments. 5. The micronucleus is shown to have a spongy, dense material in a less dense material, all of which is surrounded by a double-layered membrane. 6. The double-layered macronuclear membrane contains annuli whose outside diameter is 70 mµ; the macronuclear bodies are sometimes closely applied to the membrane. In the macronuclear reorganization bands, the solution plane is a fine network, while the reconstruction plane is devoid of structure at the level of resolution observed. 7. The mitochondria are composed of tubules, only occasionally oriented, usually embedded in a surrounding material of lower density. 8. Microbodies whose diameters are 250 to 350 mµ are frequently observed in close association with mitochondrial surfaces. 9. The food vacuoles, contractile vacuoles, and ciliary vacuoles are bounded by single-layered membranes. In the food vacuoles, the bacteria are surrounded by membranes individually or in small groups. 10. Cytoplasmic rods localized in the oral region, and cytoplasmic granules dispersed at random, are described. No typical ergastoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum, or Golgi material was observed.
