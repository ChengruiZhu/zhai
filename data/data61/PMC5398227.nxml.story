 transcripts and P-gp protein in the brain, liver, and kidney after experimental stroke. P-glycoprotein has been shown to increase in brain endothelial cells following hypoxia in vitro or after exposure to proinflammatory cytokines. Using a rat model of ischemic stroke, we hypothesized that P-gp expression will be increased in the brain, liver, and kidney in response to neuroinflammation following ischemic stroke. Adult Sprague Dawley rats underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 90 minutes and were killed at 4, 14, 24, and 48 hours postreperfusion onset to determine the time course of P-gp expression. To mimic ischemia occurring at the blood-brain barrier, rat brain endothelial (RBE4) cells were subjected to hypoxia and low glucose (HLG) for 16 hours. Immunoblotting analyses showed P-gp increases in brain and liver following 90-minute MCAO, as well as in cultured RBE4 cells after 16-hour HLG treatment, but fluctuated in the kidney depending on the time point. The relative roles of each isoform in the protein expression were analyzed with quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Ischemic stroke leads to significant increases in P-gp levels not only in the brain but also in the liver. The increase in P-gp could dramatically reduce the bioavailability and efficacy of neuroprotective drugs. Therefore, P-gp represents a big hurdle to drug delivery to the ischemic brain.
