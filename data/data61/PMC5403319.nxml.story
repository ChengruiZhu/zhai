Hypoxia occurs in a wide range of solid tumors, and is strongly associated with radio-resistance of malignant tumors. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of endostatin combined with ionizing radiation (IR) on hypoxic conditions. A total of 24 mice bearing SKOV3 ovarian carcinoma were divided into three groups. Following injection with pEgr-1-endostatin plasmid for 12 h, the mice in the endostatin-IR-treated group were exposed to 300 cGy/min X-ray for 48 h, and the IR-treated group was exposed to the same condition. Then, the expression of endostatin, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1Î± and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, ELISA, immunohistochemistry and western blotting. In addition, the tumor microvessel density (MVD) was examined by immunohistochemistry analysis of cluster of differentiation 31-positive cells. The results revealed that pEgr-1-endostatin was successfully induced by IR. The level of endostatin messenger RNA in the endostatin-IR-treated group was significantly higher than that in the control and IR-treated groups (F=380.078, P<0.001). Statistical differences were also examined at the protein level by western blotting and ELISA. An obvious increase in MVD was observed in the IR-treated group compared with that in the control group (
