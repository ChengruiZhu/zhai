The aim of the present study was to detect the candidate genes involved in the metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Gene expression profiles of primary and metastatic CRC samples in the GSE14297 and GSE49355 datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Subsequent to processing, Fishers exact test and the metaDE package in R language were applied to screen the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between primary and metastatic CRC samples. In addition, function and pathway enrichment analysis was performed using online tools in the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery resource and common DEGs in GSE14297 and GSE49355 were identified. Their expression values in another dataset, GSE29621, were then collected in order to screen the genes with high standard deviations between primary and metastatic samples, which were considered as candidate metastasis-associated genes. Candidate genes were finally verified by performing survival analysis via the log-rank test. A total of 370 DEGs were screened in GSE14297 and GSE49355, and 77 common DEGs were identified. Upregulated DEGs were mainly enriched in the immune, energy metabolism and drug metabolism-associated functions. Downregulated DEGs were mainly enriched in cell adhesion-associated functions. A total of 12 genes, including the carbonic anhydrase II (
