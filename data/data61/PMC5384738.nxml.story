 spp. Corilagin has anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, antiatherogenic, and antihypertensive effects in various experimental models. In this research, we aimed to investigate for the first time whether corilagin had apoptotic and genomic effects in ovarian cancer treatment in the same study. The potential apoptotic of corilagin was investigated using a WST1 cell proliferation test, caspase 3, and mitochondrial membrane potential JC1 assays in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Genomic changes in expression levels against corilagin treatment were measured using an Illumina human HT-12V4 BeadChip microarray. Bioinformatic data analyses were performed using GenomeStudio and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. The data of our study demonstrated that there were statistically significant time- and dose-dependent increases in caspase 3 enzymatic activity and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in line with decreases in cancer cell proliferation. According to gene-ontology analysis, we found that adherens junctions, antigen processing and presentation, and the phosphatidylinositol signaling system were the most statistically significant networks in response to corilagin treatment on SKOV3 cells, in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The apoptotic and genome-wide effects of corilagin on ovarian cancer cells were examined in detail for the first time in the literature. The results of our study suggest that corilagin might have the potential to be used as a new treatment option for epithelial ovarian cancer.
