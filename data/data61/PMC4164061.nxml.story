Penile squamous cell carcinoma (pSCC) is a rare disease, making it difficult to establish a standard of care, particularly in the advanced stage. We report a case of pSCC with advanced lymph node metastasis treated with multimodal therapy consisting of combination chemotherapy, irradiation, and chemosurgery using Mohs’ zinc chloride-containing paste. An 80-year-old male with a past history of local treatment for penile cancer presented with a large painful inguinal mass with an ulcer and exudates. The patient underwent multimodal treatment with combination chemotherapy, irradiation, and Mohs’ paste. The combination chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and docetaxel. The patient received 50-Gy external-beam radiation therapy to the left inguinal region along with daily local treatment with Mohs’ paste. After the initiation of treatment, the pain and bleeding in the inguinal region considerably ameliorated. The wound became dry and flattened 20 days after the initiation of chemotherapy. A CT scan showed that the tumor had decreased 70% in diameter 1 month after the initiation of chemotherapy. After the first course of chemotherapy, the patient and his family decided not to continue treatment because of socio-economic reasons. The patient underwent no additional treatments; nevertheless, he had no local progression of the inguinal tumors for 8 months. We report a case of successful local control of recurrent inguinal pSCC treated with multimodal therapy. Combination treatment with taxane-based chemotherapy, external-beam radiation therapy, and Mohs’ paste is an option for the management of recurrent pSCC.
