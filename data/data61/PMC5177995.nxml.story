 A 36-year-old patient had signs of intermittent hypertensive derailments, bradycardia, increased norepinephrine excretion in 24-hour urine, an increased metanephrine plasma concentration, and a positive clonidine suppression test. A suspicious mass was detected in an (18)F-DOPA-PET/CT-scan in the left seminal vesicle. Following adrenergic blockade, a robotically assisted laparoscopic left vesiculectomy with negative soft tissue surgical margins was performed. The patient sustained a couple of few months of voiding difficulties of the lower urinary tract and obstruction of the left upper urinary tract after the surgery, which resolved spontaneously with home medical treatment. Two years after the initial treatment, the patient relapsed, which was confirmed by endocrinologic follow-up tests with increased urine catecholamine, a positive clonidine suppression test, as well as an elevated blood pressure. Staging with (18)F-DOPA-PET/CT-scan confirmed the diagnosis of a recurrent PGL. This was followed by subsequent open surgical removal of the suspicious lesion in the seminal fossa. The patient is still recurrence free 15 months after the second surgery. Complications after the second surgery included an intermittent paresthesia of the left leg lasting 3 to 4 months. No other urologic symptoms such as voiding or erectile dysfunction occurred.
