Biological traits often display large amounts of genetic variability as well as genetic correlations among traits. This variability provides the raw material for evolutionary change and may alter the direction of trait evolution under selection. Despite this importance, it is unclear whether the genetic controls of variability in single traits and relationships among multiple traits have related mechanisms. Using the flowering time of a plant species as model, here we performed genetic mapping and identified a locus altering single-trait variability and multi-trait relationships. The effect likely results from the distinct thresholds required by its different alleles to trigger flowering, which can be explained by the interaction among this major locus, the variable genomic backgrounds, and the distinct environments. This view is supported by experiments showing epistatic effects of this major locus on flowering time and expression pattern of the candidate gene. Together, our results show that, at least for traits with major signal integrator genes such as flowering time, the genetic control of single-trait variability and multi-trait relationships may have a common underlying mechanism that may be generalizable to other genes or pathways, mediated by interaction among major loci, genomic backgrounds, and surrounding environments.
