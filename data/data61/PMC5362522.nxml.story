Cholangiocarcinoma is a rare, but highly fatal malignancy. However, the intrinsic mechanism involved in its tumorigenesis remains obscure. An urgent need remains for a promising target for cholangiocarcinoma biological therapies. Based on comparative proteomical technologies, we found 253 and 231 different spots in gallbladder tumor cell lines and cholangiocarcinoma cell lines, respectively, relative to non-malignant cells. Using Mass Spectrometry (MS) and database searching, we chose seven differentially expressed proteins. High Stathmin expression was found in both cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder carcinoma cells. Stathmin expression was validated using immunohistochemistry and western blot in cholangiocarcinoma tissue samples and peritumoral tissue. It was further revealed that high Stathmin expression was associated with the repression of staurosporine-induced apoptosis in the cholangiocarcinoma cell. Moreover, we found that Stathmin promoted cancer cell proliferation and inhibited its apoptosis through protein kinase B (Akt) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. Integrin, Î²1 appears to serve as a partner of Stathmin induction of ERK and Akt signaling by inhibiting apoptosis in the cholangiocarcinoma cell. Understanding the regulation of anti-apoptosis effect by Stathmin might provide new insight into how to overcome therapeutic resistance in cholangiocarcinoma.
