Do mammalian cells employ codon usage alterations in groups of transcripts to control protein translation? Although long documented in prokaryotes, single-cell eukaryotes and protozoa, no convincing evidence has been presented to indicate this is the case in mammals. Nevertheless, many recent studies have asserted that codon usage can deviate from the genomic or transcriptomic background in a functionally impactful manner. For instance, one recent study suggests that mammalian genes associated with specific GO terms show ‘codon adaptation’ towards proliferation and differentiation. We have tested a number of closely related hypotheses by collecting and analyzing a comprehensive, genome-wide set of data that quantifies codons in mRNA as well as anticodons in tRNA transcriptomes in extreme cell conditions in human and mouse. The hypotheses our data test include suggestions that codon usage biases in mammals can be actively regulated to match: (a) most-highly differentially expressed protein coding genes, (b) condition specific GO gene sets, (c) housekeeping genes, (d) genes encoding ribosomal proteins, (e) proliferation-associated protein-coding genes. We found that of the codon usage signal that remains after accounting for gene set sizes and other genomic factors is caused largely by the underlying GC content of the genomes. In other words, codon usage biases postulated to exist within mammalian transcriptomes might be explained by small gene sets or via differences in GC content across the genome.
