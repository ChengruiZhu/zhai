This study was conducted on patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the external auditory canal and temporal bone treated with surgery alone or surgery plus postoperative radiotherapy. It was designed as a retrospective investigation with complete long-term follow-up covering the years from 1983 to 2008. The setting was a tertiary referral centre. Forty-one consecutive cases underwent surgery involving en bloc lateral or subtotal temporal bone resection, parotidectomy and neck dissection plus radiotherapy in advanced cases. The Pittsburgh staging system 7 was adopted. No cases were lost to follow-up, which ranged from 2 to 220 months, while for survivors ranged from 60 to 220 months and included clinical examinations and imaging. Outcome was expressed as NED (no evidence of disease), DOC (dead of other causes), DOD (dead of disease), AWD (alive with disease), disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). Results were expressed with raw data and Kaplan Meyer curves. Patients with T1 and T2 disease had a DFS of 67% and a DSS of 92%. For T3 and T4 cases, the DFS was 41% and DSS was 48%. All treatment failures were due to local recurrences. The cases classified as T4 because the lesion extended from the cartilage canal to the periauricular soft tissues, or from the anterior wall to the parotid space, had a better outcome than the other T4 cases: this different prognosis suggests the need to stage tumours differently. Nodal disease coincided with a worse outcome due to local recurrence.
