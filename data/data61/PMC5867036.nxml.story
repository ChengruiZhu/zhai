Although radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT) has been widely used to treat orthopedic disorders with promising clinical results, rESWT largely relies on clinicians' personal experiences and arbitrary judgments, without knowing relationships between administration doses and effective doses at target sites. In fact, practitioners lack a general and reliable way to assess propagation and distribution of pressure waves inside biological tissues quantitatively. This study develops a methodology to combine experimental measurements and computational simulations to obtain pressure fields from rESWT through calibrating and validating computational models with experimental measurements. Wave pressures at the bottom of a petri dish and inside biological tissues are measured, respectively, by attaching and implanting flexible membrane sensors. Detailed wave dynamics are simulated through explicit finite element analyses. The data decipher that waves from rESWT radiate directionally and can be modeled as acoustic waves generated from a vibrating circular piston. Models are thus established to correlate pressure amplitudes at the bottom of petri dishes and in the axial direction of biological tissues. Additionally, a pilot simulation upon rESWT for human lumbar reveals a detailed and realistic pressure field mapping. This study will open a new avenue of personalized treatment planning and mechanism research for rESWT.
