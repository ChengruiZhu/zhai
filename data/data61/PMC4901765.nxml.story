Eleven consecutive patients and 13 consecutive shoulders were identified who underwent arthroscopically-assisted core decompression of the proximal humerus AVN by the two senior surgeons from 2004-2013. No patients were excluded. Six males and five females were identified with an average age of 45 years at surgery. Average follow-up length was 2.6 years. Four shoulders underwent synovectomy and core decompression alone. Concomitant procedures included rotator cuff repair in 5, subacromial decompression in 4, distal clavicle excision in 6, and biceps tenodesis in 1 shoulder(s). Radiographically, the majority of shoulders (8) remained stable without progressive sclerosis or collapse. Two shoulders demonstrated progressive sclerosis, and articular collapse was seen in 1 shoulder. The average pre-operative ASES score was 19.3, compared to 44.8 at post-operative follow-up (p=.001). Pre-operative shoulder elevation averaged 156 degrees, while post-operative range of motion averaged 170 degrees (p=.81). The majority of patients had mild or moderate pain pre-operatively, while 4 patients required narcotics for severe pre-operative pain. Visual analogue pain averaged 8.4 pre-operatively, compared to 4.9 at most recent follow-up (p=.0004). While post-operative pain initially improved in all patients, the majority of patients had return of mild, intermittent pain with longer follow-up. Two patients who took narcotics pre-operatively continued to require narcotics at final follow-up. Six shoulders had undergone therapeutic shoulder injections post-operatively. No patient had required repeat surgery.
