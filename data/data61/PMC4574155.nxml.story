The high levels of genetic diversity of the HIV-1 virus grant it the ability to escape the immune system, to rapidly evolve drug resistance, and to circumvent vaccination strategies. However, our knowledge of HIV-1 mutation rates has been largely restricted to in vitro and cell culture studies because of the inherent complexity of measuring these rates in vivo. Here, by analyzing the frequency of premature stop codons, we show that the HIV-1 mutation rate in vivo is two orders of magnitude higher than that predicted by in vitro studies, making it the highest reported mutation rate for any biological system. A large component of this rate is from host cellular cytidine deaminases, which induce mutations in the viral DNA as a defense mechanism. While the HIV-1 genome is hypermutated in blood cells, only a very small fraction of these mutations reach the plasma, indicating that many viruses are defective as a result of the extremely high mutation load. In addition, we find that the HIV-1 mutation rate tends to be higher in patients showing normal disease progression than in those undergoing rapid progression, emphasizing the negative impact on viral fitness of hypermutation by host cytidine deaminases. However, we also observe subpopulations of weakly-mutated viral genomes whose sequence diversity may influence viral pathogenesis. Our work highlights the fine balance for HIV-1 between enough mutation to evade host responses and too much mutation that can inactivate the virus.
