The emergence of Cetacea (whales, dolphins, porpoises) represents a profound transition in the history of life. Living cetaceans have evolved a spectacular array of adaptations in association with their return to aquatic habitats. Aquatic environments impose challenging constraints on sensory systems, including vision, and the cetacean eye exhibits both anatomical and molecular specializations that enhance underwater sight. Most mammals have one photopigment (RH1) for dim-light vision and two photopigments (long wavelength-sensitive opsin [LWS], short wavelength-sensitive opsin [SWS1]) for daytime, color vision. By contrast, cetaceans have an inactivated copy of the gene that encodes SWS1. Here, we show that LWS is also inactivated in several cetacean lineages including the giant sperm whale, Sowerby's beaked whale, and balaenopteroids (rorquals plus gray whale). These cetaceans dive to depths of at least 100 meters where the underwater light field is dominated by dim, blue light. The knockout of both cone pigments renders these taxa rod monochromats, a condition that is previously unknown among mammalian species. Rod opsin remains functional in these taxa and is blue-shifted to increase its sensitivity to the available blue light that occurs in deep water conditions. These results further elucidate the molecular blueprint of modern cetacean species.
