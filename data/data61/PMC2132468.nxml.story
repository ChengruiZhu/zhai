 129: 287â€“298). Pol IIo was concentrated in discrete splicing factor domains, suggesting a possible relationship between CTD phosphorylation and splicing factors, but no evidence beyond immunolocalization data was provided to support this idea. Here, we show that Pol IIo co-immunoprecipitates with members of two classes of splicing factors, the Sm snRNPs and non-snRNP SerArg (SR) family proteins. Significantly, Pol IIo's association with splicing factors is maintained in the absence of pre-mRNA, and the polymerase need not be transcriptionally engaged. We also provide definitive evidence that hyperphosphorylation of Pol II's CTD is poorly correlated with its transcriptional activity. Using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) H5 and H14, which are shown here to recognize phosphoepitopes on Pol II's CTD, we have quantitated the level of Pol IIo at different stages of the cell cycle. The level of Pol IIo is similar in interphase and mitotic cells, which are transcriptionally active and inactive, respectively. Finally, complexes containing Pol IIo and splicing factors can be prepared from mitotic as well as interphase cells. The experiments reported here establish that hyperphosphorylation of the CTD is a good indicator of polymerase's association with snRNP and SR splicing factors, but not of its transcriptional activity. Most importantly, the present study suggests that splicing factors may associate with the polymerase via the hyperphosphorylated CTD.
