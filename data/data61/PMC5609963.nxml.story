Long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21), known as the direct transcriptional target of p53, was found down-regulated in several human solid tumors. However, little is known about the role of lincRNA-p21 in gastric cancer. The expression levels of lincRNA-p21 in tissue samples and cell lines were detected by qRT-PCR. MGC-803 and MKN-45 cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting lincRNA-p21 or control siRNAs to determine the effect of reduced lincRNA-p21 expression on tumorigenesis. We also overexpressed lincRNA-p21 in MGC-803 cells. Cell proliferation was measured by CCK-8 and Ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assays. Migration and invasion abilities of cells were measured by wound healing and transwell assay. We demonstrated that lincRNA-p21 was significantly reduced in gastric cancer tissues (p<0.001) compared with that in normal tissues and this lower level of lincRNA-p21 was significantly correlated with higher invasion depth grade (p=0.024), more distant metastasis (p=0.009) and advanced TNM stage (p=0.011). Further study revealed that knock down of lincRNA-p21 could promote malignant behavior of gastric cancer cells and induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Overexpressing lincRNA-p21 showed opposite effects. Moreover, knocking down lincRNA-p21 could elevate the expression of Yes associated protein (YAP), the core effector of Hippo signaling, by elevating mRNA levels and increasing its nucleus translocation instead of the canonical Hippo pathway. Overexpression experiments verified the regulation role of lincRNA-p21 in YAP expression. Collectively, these data suggest that lincRNA-p21 could serve as a potential biomarker and a vital therapeutic target in gastric cancer.
