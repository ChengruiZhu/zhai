The aim of this study was to determine the relationship of alcohol consumption (reported in four different ways) with other specific disease-related risk factors (that is, smoking, high body mass index, low physical activity and insufficient fruit and vegetables). Data were collected from 2003 to 2015 in South Australia using an on-going monthly chronic disease and risk factor telephone survey of randomly selected persons (18+ years). The proportion of alcohol drinkers and, for those who drank alcohol, the proportion drinking more than one day per week, the proportion drinking on six or more days per week, and the mean alcohol drinks per day were assessed. Logistic regression and linear regression modelling were used on age and sex adjusted data. In total, over 71,000 respondents aged 18 years and older were interviewed (48.8% male). Overall prevalence of alcohol consumption was 81.3%. Trends in the direction promoted by current policies and preventative authorities were apparent with appropriate changes for all four measures for overall and for those underweight, undertaking sufficient activity, consuming <2 serves of fruit per day, consuming <5 serves of vegetables per day and with 3+ total risk factors. This research has provided evidence on the trends in alcohol consumption in relation to a range of other specific modifiable disease-related risk factors. The trends analysis has shown different patterns for each risk factor, and highlights the interplay between the respective modifiable or preventive risk factors.
