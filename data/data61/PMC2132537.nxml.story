We have shown in a variety of human wounds that collagenase-1 (MMP-1), a matrix metalloproteinase that cleaves fibrillar type I collagen, is invariably expressed by basal keratinocytes migrating across the dermal matrix. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that MMP-1 expression is induced in primary keratinocytes by contact with native type I collagen and not by basement membrane proteins or by other components of the dermal or provisional (wound) matrix. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that the catalytic activity of MMP-1 is necessary for keratinocyte migration on type I collagen. To test this idea, we assessed keratinocyte motility on type I collagen using colony dispersion and colloidal gold migration assays. In both assays, primary human keratinocytes migrated efficiently on collagen. The specificity of MMP-1 in promoting cell movement was demonstrated in four distinct experiments. One, keratinocyte migration was completely blocked by peptide hydroxymates, which are potent inhibitors of the catalytic activity of MMPs. Two, HaCaTs, a line of human keratinocytes that do not express MMP-1 in response to collagen, did not migrate on a type I collagen matrix but moved efficiently on denatured type I collagen (gelatin). EGF, which induces MMP-I production by HaCaT cells, resulted in the ability of these cells to migrate across a type I collagen matrix. Three, keratinocytes did not migrate on mutant type I collagen lacking the collagenase cleavage site, even though this substrate induced MMP-1 expression. Four, cell migration on collagen was completely blocked by recombinant tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and by affinity-purified anti–MMP-1 antiserum. In addition, the collagen-mediated induction of collagenase-1 and migration of primary keratinocytes on collagen was blocked by antibodies against the α2 integrin subunit but not by antibodies against the α1 or α3 subunits. We propose that interaction of the α2β1 integrin with dermal collagen mediates induction of collagenase-1 in keratinocytes at the onset of healing and that the activity of collagenase-1 is needed to initiate cell movement. Furthermore, we propose that cleavage of dermal collagen provides keratinocytes with a mechanism to maintain their directionality during reepithelialization.
