The use of cell lines in cancer research is strongly dependent on the avoidance of contaminations, the correct attribution of a cell line to the initial primary tumor and stability. Previous studies have identified expression of melanocytic molecular markers in the widely used breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-435. In the present study the three breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435, were systematically analyzed for mRNA and protein expression of major epithelial (cytokeratin isoforms), mammary (mammaglobin) and melanocytic (melan A and S100-protein) markers. Protein expression was identified by immunocytochemistry and quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine mRNA levels. While MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells unambiguously revealed an epithelial/mammary phenotype, MDA-MB-435 cells were found to exhibit epithelial/mammary and melanocytic features dependent on cell density. Subconfluent cells demonstrated epithelial characteristics only, however, densely growing, confluent cells also expressed melanocytic markers. Consistent with gain of melanocytic features, the expression levels of mammaglobin mRNA decreased in these cells. These results indicate that the three cell lines are primarily of epithelial phenotype, however, MDA-MB-435 cells revealed lineage infidelity in dense cultures with a gain in melanocytic phenotype. These characteristics must be taken into consideration when analyzing cancer-relevant genes and their expression profiles
