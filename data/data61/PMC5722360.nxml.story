With the advent of new detector technology, digital tomosynthesis imaging of the breast has, in the past few years, become a technique intensely investigated as a replacement for planar mammography. As with all other x‐ray–based imaging methods, radiation dose is of utmost concern in the development of this new imaging technology. For virtually all development and optimization studies, knowledge of the radiation dose involved in an imaging protocol is necessary. A previous study characterized the normalized glandular dose in tomosynthesis imaging and its variation with various breast and imaging system parameters. This characterization was performed with x‐ray spectra generated by molybdenum and rhodium targets. In the recent past, many preliminary patient studies of tomosynthesis imaging have been reported in which the x‐ray spectra were generated with x‐ray tubes with tungsten targets. The differences in x‐ray distribution among spectra from these target materials make the computation of new normalized glandular dose values for tungsten target spectra necessary. In this study we used previously obtained monochromatic normalized glandular dose results to obtain spectral results for twelve different tungsten target x‐ray spectra. For each imaging condition, two separate values were computed: the normalized glandular dose for the zero degree projection angle (
