 egg cytoplasm, indirect evidence suggests that nuclei and centrosomes may focus activation within the cell. We have dissected the contribution of these structures to MPF activation in fertilized eggs and in egg fragments containing different combinations of nuclei, centrosomes, and microtubules by following the behavior of Cdc2 (the kinase component of MPF), the regulatory subunit cyclin B, and the activating phosphatase Cdc25. The absence of the entire nucleus–centrosome complex resulted in a marked delay in MPF activation, whereas the absence of the centrosome alone caused a lesser delay. Nocodazole treatment to depolymerize microtubules through first interphase had an effect equivalent to removing the centrosome. Furthermore, microinjection of isolated centrosomes into anucleate eggs promoted MPF activation and advanced the onset of surface contraction waves, which are close indicators of MPF activation and could be triggered by ectopic MPF injection. Finally, we were able to demonstrate stimulation of MPF activation by the nucleus–centriole complex in vitro, as low concentrations of isolated sperm nuclei advanced MPF activation in cycling cytoplasmic extracts. Together these results indicate that nuclei and microtubule asters can independently stimulate MPF activation and that they cooperate to enhance activation locally.
