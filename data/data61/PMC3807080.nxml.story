Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune inflammatory disease of the joints and is caused by both genetic and environmental factors. In the past six years, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified many risk variants associated with RA. However, not all associations reported from GWASs are reproduced when tested in follow-up studies. To establish a reliable set of RA risk variants, we systematically classified common variants identified in GWASs by the degree of reproducibility among independent studies. We collected comprehensive genetic associations from 90 papers of GWASs and meta-analysis. The genetic variants were assessed according to the statistical significance and reproducibility between or within nine geographical populations. As a result, 82 and 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were confirmed as intra- and inter-population-reproduced variants, respectively. Interestingly, majority of the intra-population-reproduced variants from European and East Asian populations were not common in two populations, but their nearby genes appeared to be the components of common pathways. Furthermore, a tool to predict the individualâ€™s genetic risk of RA was developed to facilitate personalized medicine and preventive health care. For further clinical researches, the list of reliable genetic variants of RA and the genetic risk prediction tool are provided by open access database RAvariome.
