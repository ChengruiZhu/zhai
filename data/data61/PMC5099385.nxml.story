Mastocytosis is a disease caused by the accumulation of mast cells (MC) in the skin and/or in other tissues. Both the cutaneous form of the disease (CM) predominating in children and the systemic form (SM) typical for adults are associated with the occurrence of MC mediator-related symptoms. The release of mediators can be induced by physical stimuli and/or specific triggering factors. The routine vaccination program performed in the majority of children in infancy can be considered as an additional factor provoking exacerbation of CM. Conscious of the important role of MC in the innate immunity, we have analysed retrospective data concerning the levels of immunoglobulins, an adaptive factor, in a group of 74 infants and toddlers with CM. The values corresponding to transient hypogammaglobulinaemia of infants (THI) were found in 8 (10.81%) of cases. Classification of the antibody deficiency was done according to the working definitions for clinical diagnosis of primary immunodeficiency of the European Society of Immunodeficiencies (ESID) Registry â€“ version May 11, 2015. Following the retrospective data, the final diagnosis of THI cannot be made due to the young age of the study group. The percentage may significantly exceed the published incidence of THI, i.e. about 0.11%. The results of our study may indicate, importantly, a higher incidence of THI in childhood-onset mastocytosis than in the general paediatric population and strengthen indications for vaccinations. In conclusion, we suggest that THI may be considered as a new aspect of paediatric mastocytosis that requires further investigation.
