 KCl. The whole nucleus was then digested to various degrees with ribonuclease or trypsin, followed by washing and fixation in either osmium tetroxide or potassium permanganate. The nuclear envelope was dissected off, placed on a grid, air dried, and compared with undigested controls in the electron microscope. Some envelopes were dehydrated, embedded in methacrylate, and sectioned. Annuli around "pores" are composed of a substance or substances, at least partially fibrillar, which is preserved by osmium but lost during permanganate fixation. Material within the "pores" is also preserved by osmium but partially lost after permanganate. No evidence of granules or tubules in the annuli was found in air dried mounts although a granular appearance could be seen in tangentially oriented thin sections. Thin sections of isolated envelopes give evidence of diffuse material within the "pores" as well as a more condensed diaphragm across their waists. In whole mounts of the envelope the total density within "pores" is relatively constant from "pore" to "pore." All material within "pores," including the condensed diaphragm, is removable by trypsin digestion. Wispy material from the "pore" structure projects into the nucleus and annular material extends into the cytoplasm. Both annular and diaphragm materials remain with the envelope when it is isolated and are thus considered a part of its structure, not merely evidences of material passing through. There is no evidence of ribonuclease-removable material in any part of the "pore" complex.
