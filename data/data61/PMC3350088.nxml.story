Pathologic complete response (pCR) after NC has been consistently associated with improved outcomes. Residual DCIS after NC does not portray worse prognosis compared to complete eradication of all disease but has clinical implications regarding surgical management. We report a case of pCR of DCIS associated with invasive carcinoma in an HER-2 + tumor after NC plus trastuzumab despite persistence of malignant-appearing microcalcifications mammographically. A 41-year-old Caucasian female presented with a 4 × 4 cm mass in the right breast and a 2.5 cm right axillary node. Mammogram showed a 2.5 cm mass and a 12 cm area of linear pleomorphic, suspicious calcifications in the upper part of the breast. Core biopsy revealed invasive ductal carcinoma and DCIS associated with calcifications (ER 85%, PR 6%, Her2neu 3+ by IHC). Axillary node FNA was positive for malignancy. The patient received doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC) → paclitaxel plus T with complete clinical and radiologic response but no significant change in the microcalcifications. Final pathology showed no residual invasive carcinoma or DCIS despite the presence of numerous ducts with microcalcifications. Documented eradication of DCIS has not been reported following NC when malignant-appearing calcifications persist and this observation may have important clinical implications regarding surgical management.
