Classical views on single neuron computation treat dendrites as mere collectors of inputs, that is forwarded to the soma for linear summation and causes a spike output if it is sufficiently large. Such a single neuron model can only compute linearly separable input-output functions, representing a small fraction of all possible functions. Recent experimental findings show that in certain pyramidal cells excitatory inputs can be supra-linearly integrated within a dendritic branch, turning this branch into a spiking dendritic sub-unit. Neurons containing many of these dendritic sub-units can compute both linearly separable and linearly non-separable functions. Nevertheless, other neuron types have dendrites which do not spike because the required voltage gated channels are absent. However, these dendrites sub-linearly sum excitatory inputs turning branches into saturating sub-units. We wanted to test if this last type of non-linear summation is sufficient for a single neuron to compute linearly non-separable functions. Using a combination of Boolean algebra and biophysical modeling, we show that a neuron with a single non-linear dendritic sub-unit whether spiking or saturating is able to compute linearly non-separable functions. Thus, in principle, any neuron with a dendritic tree, even passive, can compute linearly non-separable functions.
