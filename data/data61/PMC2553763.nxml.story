The birth prevalence of MPS I in England and Wales over the period 1981 to 2003 was 1.07/100,000 births and within Â± 5% of estimates reported in several studies that examined reasonably large populations. The median survival for MPS I patients (including all phenotypes irrespective of various treatments) was found by Kaplan-Meier analysis to be 11.6 years. This result was driven by the relatively poor survival of patients with the Hurler phenotype who, irrespective of any treatments received, had a median survival of 8.7 years; when censoring for receipt of bone marrow transplant (BMT) was implemented median survival of Hurler patients was diminished to 6.8 years. The difference between these survival curves was statistically significant by log rank test and can be attributed to beneficial effects of BMT and or selection of patients with superior prognosis for intervention with BMT. Survival curves for Hurler patients who received and did not receive BMT were very different. Probability of survival at 2 year after BMT was ~68% and was similar to this after 5 years (66%) and ten years (64%); the mean age of Hurler patients at receipt of BMT was 1.33 years (range 0.1 to 3 years). Follow up was insufficient to determine median survival of the milder phenotypes however, unsurprisingly, this was clearly superior to that for Hurler patients.
