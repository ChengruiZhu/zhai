Neutralizing antibodies block infection of cells and thus are considered important to elicit with vaccines. A central problem in HIV-1 vaccine design is that HIV-1 is extremely variable and employs a number of strategies to avoid being recognized by antibodies. Despite this, a subset of infected individuals mounts potent, cross-reactive neutralizing antibody responses. We developed computational strategies for identifying correlations between mutational patterns in the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (gp120 and gp41) and neutralization phenotypes. We first applied these methods to define mutations that correlated with susceptibility to the potent neutralizing antibody b12, as a means to explore the appropriateness of applying our computational strategies to neutralizing antibody phenotypes within the well-understood context of b12-gp120 interactions. Signature sites of known importance were found. We then defined signatures in a panel of envelope glycoproteins sampled from HIV-1-infected individuals who made either potent or weak neutralizing antibody responses, with the hypothesis that common features of the envelope glycoproteins that elicit good antibodies in natural infection might be useful to incorporate as vaccine immunogens. Signature mutations associated with potent neutralizing antibody responses were concentrated in the coreceptor binding site of gp120 â€“ a key region for HIV-1 entry into cells.
