Physicians’ gender can have an impact on many aspects of patient experience of care. Organization processes through which the influence of gender is exerted have not been fully explored. The aim of this article is to compare primary health care (PHC) organizations in which female or male doctors are predominant regarding organization and patient characteristics, and to assess their influence on experience of care, preventive care delivery, use of services, and unmet needs. In 2010, we conducted surveys of a population stratified sample (N = 9180) and of all PHC organizations (N = 606) in 2 regions of the province of Québec, Canada. Patient and organization variables were entered sequentially into multilevel regression analyses to measure the impact of gender predominance. Female-predominant organizations had younger doctors and nurses with more expanded role; they collaborated more with other PHC practices, used more tools for prevention, and allotted more time to patient visits. However, doctors spent fewer hours a week at the practice in female-predominant organizations. Patients of these organizations reported lower accessibility. Conversely, they reported better comprehensiveness, responsiveness, counseling, and screening, but these effects were mainly attributable to doctors’ younger age. Their reporting unmet needs and emergency department attendance tended to decrease when controlling for patient and organization variables other than doctors’ age. Except for accessibility, female-predominant PHC organizations are comparable with their male counterparts. Mean age of doctors was an important confounding variable that mitigated differences, whereas other organization variables enhanced them. These findings deserve consideration to better understand and assess the impacts of the growing number of female-predominant PHC organizations on the health care system.
