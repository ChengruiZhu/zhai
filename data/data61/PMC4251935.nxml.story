Adeno associated vectors (AAV) have shown considerable promise to treat various genetic disorders in both preclinical and clinical settings mainly because of its safety profile. However, efficient use of AAV to deliver genes in immune-competent sites like muscles and liver requires very high doses which are associated with concomitant cellular immune response against the viral capsids leading to destruction of the transduced cells. Coupled with that, there are enough evidences that at high doses, AAV particles are subjected to increased cellular phosphorylation/uniquitination leading to proteasome mediated degradation and loss of the viral particles. The presence of preexisting immunity against AAV further adds on to the problem which is acting as a major roadblock to efficiently use it as a gene therapy vector in the clinics. To overcome this, rational bioengineering of AAV capsid becomes a prime tool by which specific amino acid residue(s) can be suitably modified/replaced by compatible residue(s) to create vectors having lower host immune response and higher intracellular trafficking rate. This article reviews the various aspects of rationally designing AAV capsids like by site-directed mutagenesis, directed evolution and combinatorial libraries which can create vectors having not only immune evasive property but also enhanced gene expression and transduction capability. One or more combinations of these strategies have strong potential to create novel vectors which will have suitable clinical efficiency even at a low dose.
