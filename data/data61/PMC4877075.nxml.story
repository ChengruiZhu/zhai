Myelin, a membranous sheet that surrounds the axons of neurons and facilitates the transmission of nerve impulses, is formed by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS), and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Failure to myelinate, or demyelination, produces the symptoms of serious diseases such as leukodystrophies and multiple sclerosis. This study identifies a novel and essential regulator of myelin formation in the CNS: the transcriptional activator Krüppel-like factor-6 (Klf6). We show that Klf6 acts as a control point through which pro-myelinating signals regulate the development of oligodendrocytes from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. Growth factors of the gp130 family are known to promote differentiation and survival of oligodendrocytes, via activation of the transcription factor Stat3, but the mechanistic details of how they do it remain unclear. Our findings show that Klf6 is induced in oligodendrocyte progenitors by gp130 growth factors, and promotes differentiation. Furthermore, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in which Klf6 is inactivated do not mature, fail to form myelin, and eventually die. We also uncover that upon gp130 signaling, Klf6 activates the nuclear import factor importin-α5 (Impα5), a key controller of trafficking into the nucleus in the CNS. Notably, inactivation of Impα5 recapitulates the features of silencing Klf6, whereas Impα5 expression can partially rescue differentiation in Klf6-deficient oligodendrocyte progenitors. Finally, inactivation of Stat3 in oligodendrocyte progenitors produces defective Klf6 and Impα5 expression and myelination failure, strongly resembling the features produced by Klf6 inactivation. Collectively, these results establish a connection between gp130-Stat3 signaling and importin-based control of nuclear trafficking, which is essential for myelination in the CNS, and places Klf6 as a key coordinator of these events.
