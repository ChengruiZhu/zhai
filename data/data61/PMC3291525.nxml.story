Cardiac arrhythmias are frequent complications of heart disease and an important cause of morbidity and mortality. The rhythmic activity of the heart relies on the action potential, a bioelectrical signal characterized by complex dynamics involving ion currents and intracellular calcium cycling. When these dynamics become unstable, arrhythmogenic patterns can emerge. A typical example is the beat-to-beat alternation of action potential parameters, a phenomenon called alternans, which represents a well known mechanism precipitating severe arrhythmias. Alternans results from the interaction of action potentials during consecutive beats. Classically, this interaction is investigated by describing the dependence of action potential parameters on previous diastolic intervals and action potential durations. However, experiments have shown that quantitative markers derived in this way are only approximate or even inappropriate to predict alternans. Here, we devised a novel procedure for the reliable prediction of alternans, based on introducing small random variations of pacing intervals followed by signal processing in the frequency domain. Using a biophysical model of the cardiac cell, we demonstrate that our algorithm accurately predicts the onset of alternans during pacing at an accelerating rate or during the application of a drug. Our approach may thus open new perspectives for the clinical evaluation of arrhythmias.
