Transplantation medicine was revolutionized by the introduction of the immunosuppressant drugs cyclosporin A and FK506 that prevent rejection of transplanted organs by the recipient's immune system. These drugs work by inhibiting calcineurin, a conserved protein phosphatase. Calcineurin regulates the immune response by dephosphorylating and activating the members of the NFAT family of transcription factors, which in turn activate genes required for the antigen-dependent stimulation of T-cells. Despite its biological and clinical importance, we have only a limited understanding of how calcineurin and other protein phosphatases interact with their substrates and target specific phosphorylated residues for dephosphorylation. Here, we determined the structure of calcineurin in complex with A238L, a viral peptide inhibitor of its function. This study shows that the viral peptide inhibits calcineurin not by targeting its active site but rather by occupying two critical substrate-binding regions of calcineurin (distant from each other and from the active site), thereby preventing its interaction with protein substrates. These findings allow us to present the first computational model of calcineurin bound to a phospho-substrate at its active site. Furthermore, by elucidating the structural basis for one particular mode of substrateâ€“calcineurin interaction, this study reveals that both this viral peptide and immunosuppressant drugs inhibit calcineurin by blocking substrate access to a single critical region of the enzyme.
