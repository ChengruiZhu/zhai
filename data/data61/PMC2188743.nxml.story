Endothelins are peptides, originally isolated from endothelial cells, with potent vasoactive and mitogenic properties. In this study, we demonstrate that human macrophages synthesize and secrete endothelins. Cultured human macrophages were found by immunocytochemistry to stain positively for endothelin 1 and endothelin 3. Their capability to produce and release these peptides was confirmed by a combination of reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassays, specific for endothelin 1 and 3, respectively. Immunoreactive peptides were identified both in cellular extracts and in macrophage-conditioned medium. The secretion of endothelin 1, but not of endothelin 3, from macrophages could be stimulated 6-10-fold by lipopolysaccharide or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Northern blot analysis of total macrophage RNA using an endothelin 1 cDNA probe revealed induction of endothelin mRNA in PMA-treated macrophages. Furthermore, immunoreactive endothelin 1 and 3 were found in U937 cells, a human promonocytic line, and in freshly isolated human monocytes. In contrast, no immunoreactive endothelin was detected in cell extracts from human neutrophils and lymphocytes. The expression of endothelins in tissue macrophages was demonstrated in paraffin sections of human lung using immunohistochemistry. In conclusion, the finding that human macrophages produce endothelins suggests an important role for these peptides in the microenvironment of tissue macrophages. Macrophage-derived endothelins may have an essential function in blood vessel physiology, and aberrant production may contribute to vessel pathology.
