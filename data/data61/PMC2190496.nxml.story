The effect of specific antigen on the development of physical interactions between lymph node lymphocytes (LNL) obtained from animals which had been immunized to that antigen and macrophages was examined. We found that the presence of antigen, either limited to the macrophage () or free in the medium, profoundly increased the degree of ) or free in the medium, profoundly increased the degree of Mphi-LNL interaction observed. This enhanced interaction was dependent on the coincidence in the cultures of Mphi bearing antigen and LNL from animals specifically immunized to that antigen. Although antigen-independent interactions developed equally well between syngeneic and allogeneic combinations of lymphocytes and macrophages, antigen mediated interactions required that macrophages and lymphocytes be syngeneic. Prolongation of antigen- mediated Mphi-LNL interactions resulted in the induction of LNL DNA synthesis, initially involving those lymphocytes physically associated with antigen-bearing Mphi. These studies are interpreted to indicate that physical interaction between immune lymphocytes and antigen- bearing Mphi represents a morphological correlate of the functional activation of immune lymphocytes. Further, it is suggested that the physical events involved in lymphocyte proliferation may proceed sequentially from antigen-independent reversible binding of lymphocytes by macrophages to prolonged antigen-stabilized interaction eventuating in the triggering of specifically immune lymphocytes.
