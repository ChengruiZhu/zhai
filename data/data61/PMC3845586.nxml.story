Glioma-related edema (GRE) is a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality from glioma. GRE is a complicated process involving not only peritumoral edema but also the water content of the tumor body. In terms of etiology, this condition derives from both GRE in the untreated state and GRE secondary to clinical intervention, and different cell types contribute to distinct components of GRE. Peritumoral edema was previously believed to loosen glioma tissue, facilitating tumor-cell invasion; however, the nutrition hypothesis of the tumor microecosystem suggests that tumor cells invade for the sake of nutrition. Edema is the pathologic consequence of the reconstructed trophic linkage within the tumor microecosystem. Glioma cells induce peritumoral brain edema via an active process that supplies a suitable niche for peritumoral invasive cells, suggesting that glioma-related peritumoral brain edema is determined by the invasive property of tumor cells. There are differences between pivotal molecular events and reactive molecular events in the development of GRE. Molecular therapy should target the former, as targeting reactive molecular events will produce undesired or even adverse results. At present, brain glioma angiogenesis models have not been translated into a new understanding of the features of brain images. The effect of these models on peritumoral brain edema is unclear. Clinical approaches should be transformed on the basis of new knowledge of the molecular mechanism underlying GRE. Exploring clinical assessment methods, optimizing the existing control strategy of GRE, and simultaneously developing new treatments are essential.
