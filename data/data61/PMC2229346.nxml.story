Inactivation of both brain and cardiac Na+ channels is modulated by activation of protein kinase C (PKC) but in different ways. Previous experiments had shown that phosphorylation of serine 1506 in the highly conserved loop connecting homologous domains III and IV (LIII/IV) of the brain Na+ channel alpha subunit is necessary for all effects of PKC. Here we examine the importance of the analogous serine for the different modulation of the rH1 cardiac Na+ channel. Serine 1505 of rH1 was mutated to alanine to prevent its phosphorylation, and the resulting mutant channel was expressed in 1610 cells. Electrophysiological properties of these mutant channels were indistinguishable from those of wild-type (WT) rH1 channels. Activation of PKC with 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) reduced WT Na+ current by 49.3 +/- 4.2% (P < 0.01) but S1505A mutant current was reduced by only 8.5 +/- 5.4% (P = 0.29) when the holding potential was -94 mV. PKC activation also caused a -17-mV shift in the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation of the WT channel which was abolished in the mutant. Thus, phosphorylation of serine 1505 is required for both the negative shift in the inactivation curve and the reduction in Na+ current by PKC. Phosphorylation of S1505/1506 has common and divergent effects in brain and cardiac Na+ channels. In both brain and cardiac Na+ channels, phosphorylation of this site by PKC is required for reduction of peak Na+ current. However, phosphorylation of S1506 in brain Na+ channels slows and destabilizes inactivation of the open channel. Phosphorylation of S1505 in cardiac, but not S1506 in brain, Na+ channels causes a negative shift in the inactivation curve, indicating that it stabilizes inactivation from closed states. Since LIII/IV containing S1505/S1506 is completely conserved, interaction of the phosphorylated serine with other regions of the channel must differ in the two channel types.
