Metastasis is the leading cause of breast cancer fatalities. To develop new therapeutic strategies, the mechanisms underlying breast cancer invasion and metastasis need to be further investigated. Peptidylprolyl isomerase (cyclophilin)-like 2 (PPIL2) is a U-box-type E3 ubiquitin ligase belonging to the cyclophilin family. Proteins within this family are the major cytosolic binding proteins of the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine A (CsA). Although PPIL2 has been reported to potentially be involved in cell migration, its role in breast cancer is still unclear. Herein, we demonstrate that PPIL2 suppressed metastasis in a breast cancer model by altering cell morphology and suppressing the epithelialâ€“mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Moreover, elevated PPIL2 inhibited EMT and breast cancer invasion by interacting with the classical EMT transcription factor, SNAI1, to enhance its ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Furthermore, PPIL2 protein level and stability was upregulated after CsA treatment, indicating that PPIL2 might be involved in CsA-mediated repression of EMT in breast cancer. Analysis of tissue samples taken from breast cancer patients showed a significant correlation between the expression of PPIL2 and the degree of cancer invasion and metastasis. In summary, these results would shed light on a potential clinical use of CsA in breast cancer patients.
