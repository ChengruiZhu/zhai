 through the inhibition of HDAC activity. Additionally, B1 caused disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential and induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in a dose- and time-dependent manner, which consequently led to cell apoptosis. We also observed that B1 inhibited cancer cell migration and angiogenesis-related signal expression, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and pro-matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -9 (pro-MMP-2/9). Gelatin zymography suggested that B1 decreased pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-9 activity. Transcription factors, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), are vital players in the many steps of carcinogenesis. B1 showed significant dose-response inhibitory effects on cytoplasmic expression and nuclear translocation of both phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) and NF-κB. It has been well documented that reactivated telomerase confers cancer cells the ability to repair DNA. Real-time PCR results indicated that B1 inhibited STAT3 and NF-κB mRNA expression and telomerase activity. Taken together, our results demonstrated that B1 exerted significant inhibitory effects on HDAC, telomerase activities, oncogenic STAT3 and NF-κB expression. The inhibition of the intricate crosstalk between STAT3 and NF-κB may be a major factor in the molecular action mechanism of B1. The multiple targeting effects of B1 render it a potential new drug for lung cancer therapy.
