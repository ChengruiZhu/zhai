Frog rod outer segments contain approximately 0.25 mol of GTP and 0.25 mol of ATP per mol of rhodopsin 3 min after their isolation from the retina. UTP and CTP are present at 10-fold and 100-fold lower levels, respectively. Concentrations of GTP and ATP decline in parallel over the next 4 min to reach relatively stable levels of 0.1 mol per mol of rhodopsin. Illumination reduces the concentration of endogenous GTP but not ATP. This light-induced decrease in GTP can be as large as 70% and has a half-time of 7 s. GTP is reduced to steady intermediate levels during extended illumination of intermediate intensity, but partially returns to its dark-adapted level after brief illumination. The magnitude of the decrease increases as a linear function of the logarithm of continuous light intensity at levels which bleach between 5 X 10(2) and 5 X 10(6) rhodopsin molecules/outer segment per second. This exceeds the range of intensities over which illumination causes decreases in the cyclic GMP content and permeability of isolated outer segments (Woodruff and Bownds. 1979. J. Gen. Physiol. 73:629-653). Thus, over 4 log units of light intensity, a sensitivity control mechanism functions to make extended illumination less effective in stimulating a GTP decrease. GTP levels in dark-adapted outer segments are sensitive to changes in calcium concentration in the suspending medium. If the external calcium concentration is reduced to 10(-8) M, GTP concentration is lowered to the same level caused by saturating illumination, and the GTP remaining is no longer light-sensitive. Lowering calcium concentration to intermediate levels between 10(-6) and 10(-8) M reduces GTP to stable intermediate levels, and the GTP remaining can be reduced by light. Restoration of millimolar calcium drives synthesis of GTP, but not of ATP, and GTP lability towards illumination is again observed. These calcium-induced changes in GTP are diminished by the addition of the divalent cation ionophore A23187. Lowering or raising magnesium levels does not influence the GTP concentration. These data raise the possibility that light activates either a calcium transport mechanism driven by the hydrolysis of GTP, or some other calcium-sensitive GTPase activity of unknown function. Known light-dependent reactions involving cyclic nucleotide transformations and rhodopsin phosphorylation appear to account for only a small fraction of the light-induced GTP decrease.
