G protein coupled chemokine receptors are proteins embedded in the cell membrane. They play essential roles in the human immune system. Moreover, chemokine receptors are also involved in various diseases including cancer metastasis and HIV infection leading to AIDS. In case of the chemokine receptors CXCR4, CCR5, and CCR2, recent studies revealed that the proteins associate to so-called dimers, consisting of two receptors. This dimerization was shown to regulate protein function. Consequently, the association of chemokine receptors increasingly gained attention for modern drug design. However, structural information about chemokine receptor dimers is scarce due to experimental limitations. Here, we present first atomistic insight into chemokine receptor dimer structures consisting of either two equal receptors (homodimers) or of two different receptors (heterodimers). To this end, we employed thousands of molecular dynamics simulations of the receptor association process. The simulations revealed similar homodimerization patterns for the closely related receptors CCR5 and CCR2, and pinpointed the dimerization hotspots on both proteins. Cholesterol was found to differentiate the association patterns between CXCR4 and the related CC chemokine receptors, indicating that both heterodimerization and the interplay with cholesterol play important roles in fine-tuning chemokine-related signaling pathways.
