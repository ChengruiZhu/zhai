The patch-clamp technique is used to investigate divalent ion block of the large-conductance K+ channel from Chara australis. Block by Ba2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and Pt(NH3)4(2+) from the vacuolar and cytoplasmic sides is used to probe the structure of, and ion interactions within, the pore. Five divalent ion binding sites are detected. Vacuolar Ca2+ reduces channel conductance by binding to a site located 7% along the membrane potential difference (site 1, delta = 0.07; from the vacuolar side); it also causes channel closures with mean a duration of approximately 0.1- 1 ms by binding at a deeper site (site 2, delta = 0.3). Ca2+ can exit from site 2 into both the vacuolar and cytoplasmic solutions. Cytoplasmic Ca2+ reduces conductance by binding at two sites (site 3, delta = -0.21; site 4, delta = -0.6; from the cytoplasmic side) and causes closures with a mean duration of 10-100 ms by binding to site 5 (delta = -0.7). The deep sites exhibit stronger ion specificity than the superficial sites. Cytoplasmic Ca2+ binds sequentially to sites 3-5 and Ca2+ at site 5 can be locked into the pore by a second Ca2+ at site 3 or 4. Ca2+ block is alleviated by increasing [K+] on the same side of the channel. Further, Ca2+ occupancy of the deep sites (2, 4, and 5) is reduced by K+, Rb+, NH4+, and Na+ on the opposite side of the pore. Their relative efficacy correlates with their relative permeability in the channel. While some Ca2+ and K+ sites compete for ions, Ca2+ and K+ can simultaneously occupy the channel. Ca2+ binding at site 1 only partially blocks channel conduction. The results suggest the presence of four K+ binding sites on the channel protein. One cytoplasmic facing site has an equilibrium affinity of 10 mM (site 6, delta = -0.3) and one vacuolar site (site 7, delta less than 0.2) has low affinity (greater than 500 mM). Divalent ion block of the Chara channel shows many similarities to that of the maxi-K channel from rat skeletal muscle.
