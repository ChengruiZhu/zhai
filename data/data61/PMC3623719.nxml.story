DNA sequencing is used routinely within biology to reveal the genetic information of living organisms. In recent years, technological advances have led to the availability of high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequencing machines (‘sequencers’). In 2011, Life Sciences released a new sequencer, the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM). This is the first sequencer to measure changes in pH rather that emitted light to register sequencing reactions. Consequently, this unique technology is both cost-effective and advertised to have high accuracy, making it attractive for many laboratories. However, every sequencing technology introduces unique errors and biases into the resulting DNA sequences, and understanding PGM-specific characteristics is crucial to determining suitable applications for this new technology. We comprehensively examine the types of errors and biases in PGM-sequenced data across several experimental variables, including chip density, template kit, template DNA and across two machines. Using statistical approaches, we quantify the influence of experimental variables, as well as DNA sequence-specific effects, and find that the PGM has two types of technology-specific errors. We also find that the accuracy of the PGM is poorer than that of light-based technologies, and we make recommendations for this technology as well as provide statistical models for overcoming PGM sequencing errors.
