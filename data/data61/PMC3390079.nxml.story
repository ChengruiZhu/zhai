We report the management of a patient with secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) and severe pulmonary hypertension. A 65-year-old male with recently diagnosed atrial septal defect was referred to our centre for decompensated right heart failure with rest and exercise induced dispnea and severe pulmonary hypertension. Right heart catheterization confirmed a mean pulmonary pressure of about 55 mmHg and a Qp/Qs of 2.7. An occlusion test with a compliant large balloon demonstrated partial fall of pulmonary arterial pressure. The implantation of a home-made fenestrated Amplatzer ASD Occluder (ASO) was planned in order to decrease left-to-right shunt and promote further decrease of pulmonary arterial pressure in the long-term. Thus, by means of mechanical intracardiac echocardiography study with a 9F 9 MHz UltraIce catheter (Boston Scientific Corp.), we selected a 34 mm ASO for implantation. Four millimeter fenestration was made inflating a 4 mm non-compliant coronary balloon throughout the waist of the ASO, which was successfully implanted under intracardiac echocardiography. After six months, a decrease of pulmonary arterial pressure to 24 mmHg and full compensated right heart failure was observed on transthoracic echocardiography and clinical examination. This case suggests that transcatheter closure with home-made fenestrated ASD in elderly patients with severe pulmonary hypertension is feasible.
