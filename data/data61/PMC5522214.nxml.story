In order to refine the location and metastasis-risk density of 16 lymph node stations of gastric cancer for neoadjuvant radiotherapy, we retrospectively reviewed the initial images and pathological reports of 255 gastric cancer patients with lymphatic metastasis. Metastatic lymph nodes identified in the initial computed tomography images were investigated by two radiologists with gastrointestinal specialty. A circle with a diameter of 5 mm was used to identify the central position of each metastatic lymph node, defined as the LNc (the central position of the lymph node). The LNc was drawn at the equivalent location on the reference images of a standard patient based on the relative distances to the same reference vessels and the gastric wall using a Monaco® version 5.0 workstation. The image manipulation software Medi-capture was programmed for image analysis to produce a contour and density atlas of 16 lymph node stations. Based on a total of 2846 LNcs contoured (31–599 per lymph node station), we created a density distribution map of 16 lymph node drainage stations of the stomach on computed tomography images, showing the detailed radiographic delineation of each lymph node station as well as high-risk areas for lymph node metastasis. Our mapping can serve as a template for the delineation of gastric lymph node stations when defining clinical target volume in pre-operative radiotherapy for gastric cancer.
