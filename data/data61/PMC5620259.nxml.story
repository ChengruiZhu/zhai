Because patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) are usually diagnosed at an advanced stage and current serum tumor markers have limited diagnostic efficacy, there is an urgent need to identify reliable diagnostic biomarkers. To better define the diagnostic potential of microRNAs (miRNAs) for CRC, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of reported circulating CRC miRNA markers. After a systematic literature review, we selected 30 candidate miRNAs and used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to examine their expression in a training cohort of 120 plasma samples (CRC vs healthy controls (HC) = 60:60). Expression data was confirmed in a validation cohort of 160 plasma samples (CRC vs HC = 80:80). We ultimately identified 5 dysregulated circulating miRNAs (miR-15b, miR-17, miR-21, miR-26b, and miR-145), of which miR-21 and miR-26b proved to have the best diagnostic performance in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. Based on these results, we propose a novel blood-based diagnostic model, integrating 5 CRC-related miRNAs and serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), which provides better diagnostic performance than the combined 5 miRNAs, CEA alone, or any single miRNA. We propose that the novel CRC diagnostic model presented here will be useful for overcoming the limitations faced by current non-invasive diagnostic strategies.
