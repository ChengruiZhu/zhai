The recognition of antigenic peptides by cytotoxic T-cells is one of the crucial steps during the adaptive immune response. Thus a detailed understanding of this process is not only important for elucidating the mechanism behind T-cell signaling, but also for various emerging new medical applications like T-cell based immunotherapies and designed bio-therapeutics. However, despite the fast growing interest in this field, the mechanistic basis of the immune response is still largely unknown. Previous qualitative studies suggested that the T-cell receptor (TCR) Vα/Vβ-interdomain angle plays a crucial role in epitope recognition as it predetermines the relative position of its antigen-recognizing CDR1-3 loops and thus TCR specificity. In the manuscript we present a systematic bioinformatic analysis of the structural characteristics of bound and unbound TCR molecules focusing on the Vα/Vβ-angle. Our results demonstrate the importance of this angle for signaling, as several distinct Vα/Vβ-angle based structural clusters could be observed and larger angle flexibilities exist for unbound TCRs than for bound TCRs, providing quantitative proof for a two-step locking mechanism upon epitope recognition. In this context, we could identify a unique rotational point, which allows a quantitative, yet intuitive description of all observed angle variations and the structural changes upon epitope binding.
