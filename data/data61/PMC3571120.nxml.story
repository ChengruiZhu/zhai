Urinary incontinence (UI) is a common condition in women which can be caused by the weakening or dysfunction of pelvic floor muscles as a result of ageing, pregnancy or obesity. Prevalence of UI is higher in women than that of diabetes, depression and hypertension but rates are difficult to establish because there is evidence of a reluctance to seek help and assumptions that symptoms are normal and untreatable. Women can become increasingly depressed and isolated. The first line of treatment for UI is pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) and effectiveness has been shown in over 50 randomised controlled trials. However, there are gaps in research about motivation and adherence to exercise. Research about mobile participatory healthcare has identified the role of technology in addressing problems with adherence. There has been an increase in the use of smart phones to access the internet and in the number of health related applications but there is a lack of research about how individuals interact with this new technology and a lack of understanding about effectiveness of different elements of the technology. Mobile phone apps have been developed to support women in PFMT. The approaches used to promote exercise include; improving incontinence symptoms, strengthening muscles after pregnancy and increasing sexual sensation. The apps have features such as; reminders, counts and graphs to show progress, and timers for contractions. Research will be undertaken in Moray, North East Scotland to increase understanding of the experience of community dwelling women in using apps for PFMT. This study forms part of doctoral research which will also include an explanatory randomised controlled trial and post-trial interviews.
