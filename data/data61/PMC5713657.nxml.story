Effects of ad-libitum access to high [HIGH; 1.62 Mcal/kg of dry matter (DM)] or adequate (CON; 1.35 Mcal/kg of DM) dietary energy for 8 wk on mesenteric (MAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissue transcript profiles were assessed in non-pregnant non-lactating Holstein dairy cows using a 13,000-sequence annotated bovine oligonucleotide microarray. Statistical analysis revealed 409 and 310 differentially expressed genes (DEG) due to tissue and diet. Bioinformatics analysis was conducted using the Dynamic Impact Approach (DIA) with the KEGG pathway database. Compared with SAT, MAT had more active biological processes related to adipose tissue accumulation (adiponectin secretion) and signs of pro-inflammatory processes due to adipose tissue expansion and macrophage infiltration (generation of ceramides). Feeding the HIGH diet led to changes in mRNA expression of genes associated with cell hypertrophy (regucalcin), activation of adipogenesis (phospholipid phosphatase 1), insulin signaling activation (neuraminidase 1) and angiogenesis (semaphorin 4G, plexin B1). Further, inflammation due to HIGH was underscored by mRNA expression changes associated with oxidative stress response (coenzyme Q3, methyltransferase), ceramide synthesis (N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase 1), and insulin signaling (interferon regulatory factor 1, phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1, retinoic acid receptor alpha). Activation of ribosome in cows fed HIGH indicated the existence of greater adipocyte growth rate (M-phase phosphoprotein 10, NMD3 ribosome export adaptor).
