Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents the reference imaging modality for image guided adaptive brachytherapy (IGABT) of cervix cancer. Accurate interpretation of pre-treatment MRI is required for proper understanding of the tumor extent and topography at IGABT. Planning and optimal timing of the application begins already before treatment, and may need to be adapted during external beam irradiation (EBRT) according to additional clinical and/or radiological findings. The level of MRI utilization in IGABT depends on the infrastructural capabilities of individual centers, ranging from no use at all to repetitive imaging during EBRT and each IGABT fraction. In this article, we summarize the role of different imaging modalities and practical aspects of MRI interpretation in cervix cancer IGABT, concentrating on the systematic evaluation of post-insertion images. MRI with the applicator in place from the radiation oncologistâ€™s perspective should begin with immediate identification of eventual complications of the application procedure and assessment of the implant adequacy, followed by appropriate corrective measures in case of adverse findings. Finally, the tumor extent, topography, and treatment response should be evaluated in the context of initial clinical and radiological findings to allow for an appropriate selection and delineation of the target volumes.
