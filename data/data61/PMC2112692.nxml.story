An efficient method has been devised to introduce lipid molecules into the plasma membrane of mammalian cells. This method has been applied to fuse lipid vesicles with the apical plasma membrane of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. The cells were infected with fowl plague or influenza N virus. 4 h after infection, the hemagglutinin (HA) spike glycoprotein of the virus was present in the apical plasma membrane of the cells. Lipid vesicles containing egg phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and an HA receptor (ganglioside) were then bound to the cells at 0 degrees C. More than 85% of the vesicles were released by external neuraminidase at 0 degrees C or by simply warming the cells to 37 degrees C for 10 s, probably because of the action of the viral neuraminidase at the cell surface. However, when the cells were warmed to 37 degrees C in a pH 5.3 medium for 30 s, 50% of the bound vesicles could no longer be released by external neuraminidase. This only occurred when the HA protein had been cleaved into its HA1 and HA2 subunits. When we used influenza N virus, whose HA is not cleaved in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, cleavage with external trypsin was required. The fact that the HA protein has fusogenic properties at low pH only in its cleaved form suggests that fusion of the vesicles with the plasma membrane had taken place. Further confirmation for fusion was obtained using an assay based on the decrease of energy transfer between two fluorescent phospholipids in a vesicle upon fusion of the vesicle with the plasma membrane (Struck, D. K., D. Hoekstra, and R. E. Pagano. 1981. Biochemistry, 20:4093-4099).
