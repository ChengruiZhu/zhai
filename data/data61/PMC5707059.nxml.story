Adenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas (ASCP) is an uncommon variant of exocrine pancreatic malignancies, characterized by a histological admixture of adenomatous and squamous cell elements. This cancer is characterized by a poorly differentiated histology and a poorer clinical outcome compared to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Unlike PDAC, that is characterized by a low microvascular density (MVD) and collapsed vasculature, no data are available about angiogenesis in ASPC. Immunohistochemical evaluation of MVD and trypatse-positive mast cells (MCs) were performed on a single case of ASCP compared to PDAC. Moreover, the levels of angiopoietin-1 and -2 (Ang-1, Ang-2), receptor tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin and epidermal growth factor homology domain-2 (Tie-2), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1A), miR-21-5p, miR-181a-5p, miR-122-5p, and miR-27a-3p were evaluated by real-time PCR. Higher number of tryptase-positive MCs and MVD are observed in the ASCP case compared to PDAC one. Lower levels of miR-122-5p and higher expression of VEGFA, HIF1A and Ang-2 genes were observed in ASCP. Furthermore, lower Ang-1 and Tie-2 transcript levels and higher increases of miR-21-5p, miR27a-3p and miR-181a-5p levels were found in the rarest form of pancreatic carcinoma. Our data demonstrate an important angiogenic activity in ASCP with a putative role of miR-21-5p, miR-181a-5p, miR-122-5p and miR-27a-3p in the regulation of this process.
