Retinoic acid (RA) is the most active metabolic product of vitamin A. The embryonic heart is particularly sensitive to inappropriate RA levels, with cardiac outflow tract (OFT) defects among the most common RA-induced malformations. However, the mechanisms underlying these RA-induced defects are not understood. Cyp26 enzymes facilitate degradation of RA and thus are required to limit RA levels in early development. Here, we present evidence that loss of Cyp26 enzymes induces cardiac OFT defects through two mechanisms. First, we find that Cyp26-deficient zebrafish embryos fail to add later-differentiating ventricular cardiac progenitors to the OFT, with some of these progenitors instead contributing to the nearby arch arteries. Second, Cyp26-deficient embryos cannot maintain the integrity of the nascent heart tube, with ventricular cells within the heart tube losing their polarity and being extruded. Our data indicate that excess expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9, an enzyme that degrades the extracellular matrix, underlies both the cardiac progenitor addition and heart tube integrity defects seen in Cyp26-deficient embryos. Our findings highlight perturbation of the extracellular matrix as a major cause of RA-induced cardiac OFT defects that specifically disrupt ventricular development at later stages than previously appreciated.
