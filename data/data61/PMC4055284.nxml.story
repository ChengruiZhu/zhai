The determinants of influenza spatial spread are not fully understood, in part due to the insufficient geographic resolution of incidence data. We address this using a fine-grained private sector electronic health database of insurance claims data from health encounters in the US during 2009. We used physician diagnoses codes to generate a dataset of the weekly number of office visits with diagnosed influenza-like illness for 271 US locations. Applying statistical and mathematical models to these disease data, we find that the main autumn wave of the 2009 pandemic in the US was remarkably spatially structured. Its onset in the South Eastern US precipitated a slow radial spread that took 3 months to diffuse across the country. These patterns were replicated by models that included short-distance spatial transmission between nearby locations and increased transmission rates when school was in session. Our results contrast with previous modelling studies that indicated that environmental factors, population sizes, and long-distance transmission events (air traffic) are major determinants in disease spread. We conclude that the 2009 pandemic autumn wave spread slowly because transmissibility of the influenza virus was relatively low and children (who travel long distance far less than adults) were the predominant sources of infection.
