The early post-operative course after hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome has not been thoroughly characterized or correlated to factors that may influence recovery. The aim of this study was to report on early pain, function and attitudes towards rehabilitation and to determine predictors of early recovery after hip arthroscopy. Sixty-two patients reported pre-operative pain, iHOT-12 (hip functional score), psychological status and other baseline characteristics. Pain, iHOT-12, hip flexion and several other outcomes were measured through 6 weeks post-operative. Baseline characteristics were correlated with outcomes using univariate and multivariable models. Pain relief started on post-operative day 1 and consistently improved throughout the 6 weeks of follow-up. The average patient’s pain was reduced from a pre-operative level of 5/10 to 2/10 by 6 weeks post-operative. Similarly, iHOT-12 improved from 33/100 to 57/100 whereas hip flexion increased by 9° by 6 weeks post-operative. At 2 weeks post-operative, pre-operative anti-inflammatory usage was associated with greater improvement in pain and swelling; pre-operative opioid usage with poorer patient-reported helpfulness of and adherence to rehabilitation; and higher ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) score and lower procedure time with improvement of the pre-operative pain complaint. At 6 weeks, greater depression was associated with lower post-operative pain reduction but greater pre-operative pain complaint improvement. Continuous passive motion usage was associated with increased hip flexion. Pain improved from pre-operative by Day 1 after hip arthroscopy, and early functional improvements were seen by 6 weeks post-operative. Pre-operative anti-inflammatory and opioid usage, depression, race, ASA score, procedure time and continuous passive motion usage were significantly associated with study outcomes.
