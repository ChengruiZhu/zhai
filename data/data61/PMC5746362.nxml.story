4-Nonylphenol (4-NP) is a known endocrine disrupting chemical and a persistent environmental contaminant. However, the 4-NP caused mechanism of reproductive toxicity still remains largely unknown in birds. In this study, female chickens (Hy-Line Variety White) were dosed via oral gavage in the early laying period with 0, 50, 100, and 200 mg 4-NP/kg/d for 60 days. Food intake and weight increase were monitored in this organism to investigate chicken growth and development. Moreover, pathological changes of reproductive organs, serum hormone, and mRNA changes on the HPOA were detected. The results showed that gonad development and maturity were retarded in female chickens, and the circulating concentrations of sex hormones were disordered in 4-NP-treated chicken. In 4-NP exposed animals, the mRNA expressions of GnRH and PRLH in hypothalamus and FSH and LH in pituitary were significantly unregulated by 4-NP. In addition, expressions of FSHR and LHR were down-regulated in ovaries of the 4-NP-treatment group, while the levels of stAR, P450scc, P450arom, 3β-HSD, and 17β-HSD were up-regulated in ovaries. Furthermore, expression of ERα in the ovaries of chicken was up-regulated, however, no significant change was observed for ERβ expression. Our results suggest that granulosa cells were an important target and severely disturbed by 4-NP.
