To date, due to the rarity, tumor biology and carcinogenesis of small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA), the disease has been explored insufficiently and immunophenotyping and molecular characterization have not been finalized. This knowledge gap consecutively leads to an overt lack of diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations. In the current study, we provide our experience with the treatment of SBA, and demand for cross-national data pooling to enable unlimited information transfer and higher powered study. A comprehensive database of all patients with SBA was established and consecutively reviewed for clinicopathohistological data, information concerning preoperative evaluation, surgical and chemotherapeutical treatment, as well as outcome parameters. Patients underwent curative intended surgery (42.4%; n=14), adjuvant chemotherapy (CTX) following resection (36.4%; n=12) or palliative care (21.2%; n=7). The majority of patients were diagnosed at an advanced disease stage (pT3, 36.4%; pT4, 39.4%) and the duodenum was the most common tumor site (57.1%; n=20). Complete surgical resection was achieved in 88.5% of patients, while postoperative complications occurred in 19.4%. Within a mean follow-up period of 31.4 months, 17 patients succumbed to the disease following a median survival time of 11 months. Mean overall survival (OS) was 47.4, 25.3 and 9.8 months for surgically, surgically and chemotherapeutically and palliatively treated patients, respectively. Early surgical resection remains the mainstay in the treatment of localized SBA, since it is associated with a prolongation of OS. The role of neoadjuvant and adjuvant CTX has not yet been defined. Thus, since no consensus exists on the adequate treatment of these malignancies, we demand an international collaboration and cross-national data pooling to pave the way for the implementation of evidence-based standard care operating procedures.
