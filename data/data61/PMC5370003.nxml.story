Growing evidence has shown that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can serve as prospective markers for survival in patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma. However, most studies have explored a limited number of lncRNAs in a small number of cases. The objective of this study is to identify a panel of lncRNA signature that could evaluate the prognosis in colorectal adenocarcinoma based on the data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Altogether, 371 colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) patients with complete clinical data were included in our study as the test cohort. A total of 578 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs) were observed, among which 20 lncRNAs closely related to overall survival (OS) in COAD patients were identified using a Cox proportional regression model. A risk score formula was developed to assess the prognostic value of the lncRNA signature in COAD with four lncRNAs (LINC01555, RP11-610P16.1, RP11-108K3.1 and LINC01207), which were identified to possess the most remarkable correlation with OS in COAD patients. COAD patients with a high-risk score had poorer OS than those with a low-risk score. The multivariate Cox regression analyses confirmed that the four-lncRNA signature could function as an independent prognostic indicator for COAD patients, which was largely mirrored in the validating cohort with rectal adenocarcinoma (READ) containing 158 cases. In addition, the correlative genes of LINC01555 and LINC01207 were enriched in the cAMP signaling and mucin type O-Glycan biosynthesis pathways. With further validation in the future, our study indicates that the four-lncRNA signature could serve as an independent biomarker for survival of colorectal adenocarcinoma.
