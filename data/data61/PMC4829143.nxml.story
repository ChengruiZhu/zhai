, has been shown to have anticancer properties. However, the effects of magnobovatol on VSMCs are unknown. In the present study, we examined the effects of magnobovatol on the PDGF-BB-induced migration of mouse and human VSMCs, as well as the underlying mechanisms. Magnobovatol significantly inhibited the PDGF-BB-induced migration of mouse and human VSMCs without inducing cell death (as shown by MTT assay and wound healing assay). Additionally, we demonstrated that magnobovatol significantly blocked the PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of the PDGF receptor (PDGF-R), Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 by inhibiting the activation of the PDGF-BB signaling pathway. Moreover, in both mouse and human VSMCs, magnobovatol inhibited PDGF-induced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 expression at the mRNA and protein level, as well as the proteolytic activity of MMP-2 (as shown by western blot analysis, RT-PCR, gelatin zymography and ELISA). In addition, the sprout outgrowth formation of aortic rings induced by PDGF-BB was inhibited by magnobovatol (as shown by aortic ring assay). Taken together, our findings indicate that magnobovatol inhibits VSMC migration by decreasing MMP-2 expression through PDGF-R and the ERK1/2 and Akt pathways. Our data may improve the understanding of the anti-atherogenic effects of magnobovatol in VSMCs.
