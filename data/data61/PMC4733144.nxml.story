HIV infection has become a chronic illness when successfully treated with combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). The long-term health prognosis of aging with controlled HIV infection and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) remains unclear. In this review, we propose that, almost 20Â years after the introduction of cART, a change in research focus is needed, with a greater emphasis on chronicity effects driving our research strategy. We argue that pre-emptive documentation of episodes of mild neurocognitive dysfunction is needed to determine their long-term prognosis. This strategy would also seek to optimally represent the entire HAND spectrum in therapeutic trials to assess positive and/or negative treatment effects on brain functions. In the first part of the paper, to improve the standard implementation of the Frascati HAND diagnostic criteria, we provide a brief review of relevant quantitative neuropsychology concepts to clarify their appropriate application for a non-neuropsychological audience working in HIV research and wanting to conduct randomized clinical trials on brain functions. The second part comprises a review of various antiretroviral drug classes and individual agents with respect to their effects on HAND, while also addressing the question of when cART should be initiated to potentially reduce HAND incidence. In each section, we use recent observational studies and randomized controlled trials to illustrate our perspective while also providing relevant statistical comments. We conclude with a discussion of the neuroimaging methods that could be combined with neuropsychological approaches to enhance the validity of HIV neurology (neuroHIV) treatment effect studies.
