Humans have numerous senses, wherein vision, hearing, smell, taste, and touch are considered as the five conventionally acknowledged senses. Triggered by light, sound, or other physical stimulations, the sensory organs of human body are excited, leading to the transformation of the afferent energy into neural activity. Also converting other signals into electronical signals, graphene‐based film shows its inherent advantages in responding to the tiny stimulations. In this review, the human‐like senses and reflexes of graphene‐based films are presented. The review starts with the brief discussions about the preparation and optimization of graphene‐based film, as where as its new progress in synthesis method, transfer operation, film‐formation technologies and optimization techniques. Various human‐like senses of graphene‐based film and their recent advancements are then summarized, including light‐sensitive devices, acoustic devices, gas sensors, biomolecules and wearable devices. Similar to the reflex action of humans, graphene‐based film also exhibits reflex when under thermal radiation and light actuation. Finally, the current challenges associated with human‐like applications are discussed to help guide the future research on graphene films. At last, the future opportunities lie in the new applicable human‐like senses and the integration of multiple senses that can raise a revolution in bionic devices.
