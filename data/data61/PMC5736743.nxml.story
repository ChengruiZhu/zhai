Associating Liver Partition and Portal vein ligation for Staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) is a novel method to prevent post-hepatectomy hepatic failure. We present a case of periductal infiltrating intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma undergone ALPPS, that was conducted as intraoperative choice instead of conducting preoperative portal vein embolization (PVE). A 65-year-old male patient was to undergo extended right posterior sectionectomy, but the operation plan was changed to conduct right hepatectomy with/without bile duct resection due to invasion of the right hepatic duct. After deciding to conduct ALPPS, we stopped further perihilar dissection and liver was transected. The right portal vein was ligated and Surgicel was densely packed between the transected hemilivers. There was rapid regeneration of the left liver on computed tomography follow-up, thus the second-stage right hepatectomy was conducted 10 days after the first-stage operation. Bile duct resection (BDR) was not performed due to heavy perihilar adhesion and inflammation, but fortunately tumor-negative bile duct resection margin was achieved after meticulous dissection. This patient recovered uneventfully and discharged nine days after the second-stage right hepatectomy. Thereafter he underwent concurrent chemoradiation therapy. He is doing well so far without evidence of tumor recurrence for 20 months after operation. In conclusion, this case suggests that ALPPS may be applied to an unexpected situation requiring PVE, but ALPPS is not recommend for treatment of perihilar malignancy requiring BDR.
