Keratin 5 (K5) is present in the basal layer of a stratified squamous keratinized and non-keratinized epithelium. K5 and K14 have been demonstrated in the mucosa and tumors of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx, and in the mitotic active basal cells of a stratified squamous epithelium. The aim of the present study was to assess K5 expression in squamocellular carcinoma with various localizations in the head and neck. A total of 13 biopsy fragments were included from patients diagnosed with squamocellular carcinoma of the larynx area (n=2), pharynx (n=2), hard palate (n=1), tongue (n=2), submandibular (n=1), lip (n=1), gingival sulcus (n=1), nasal pyramid (n=1), maxilla (n=1) and zygomatic (n=1). The immunohistochemical staining for K5 was evaluated according to the following score criteria: 0 (0% positive cells); 1 (<10% positive cells); 2 (10â€“30% positive cells); and 3 (>30% positive cells). K5 expression was observed in all squamocellular carcinomas included in the present study with scores between 1 and 3. For well- and moderately-differentiated histopathological types, a maximum score of 3 was recorded for all of the cases, not including the laryngeal area, which presented a score of 2. The following scores were identified in the regions of the poorly differentiated carcinomas: Jaw, 3; gingival sulcus, 2; and tongue and submandibular area, 1. These observations may aid with an improved stratification of head and neck squamocellular carcinoma, thus improving the diagnosis and treatment strategies for this type of cancer.
