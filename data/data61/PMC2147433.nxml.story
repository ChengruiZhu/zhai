 Nuclei of calf thymus and liver and of rat liver were isolated in sucrose media and a number of their properties studied in relation to those of corresponding nuclei isolated in non-aqueous media with a view to determining their capacity to retain soluble components. The best preparations of sucrose nuclei were obtained from calf thymus. Cytochrome oxidase measurements and DNA/N ratios were far less sensitive than microscopic examination as indicators of purity when rat liver and calf thymus nuclei were compared. No satisfactory preparation of calf liver nuclei was obtained, contamination with whole cells having been appreciable; such preparations, nevertheless, could be used to advantage in the tests undertaken. DNA content of thymus nuclei isolated in sucrose was much the same as that of non-aqueous ones, pointing to a retention of soluble protein under aqueous conditions of isolation. That this net retention of protein was not due to the impermeability of the nuclear membrane was shown by the hydrolysis of the DNA upon addition of some crystalline DNAase to a sucrose suspension of nuclei. A comparative study of liver and thymus nuclei isolated in aqueous and non-aqueous media with respect to the soluble enzymes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, adenosine deaminase, and nucleoside phosphorylase yielded the following results: 1. Lyophilization of sucrose-isolated nuclei and their extraction with the organic solvents used in the non-aqueous procedure did not inactivate any of the enzymes tested. In the case of thymus the reverse was true, there being a marked increase in activity of all the enzymes studied. 2. In thymus, nucleoside phosphorylase and adenosine deaminase were active to approximately the same extent in nuclei isolated by either procedure. Glucose phosphate dehydrogenase alone was more active in sucrose-isolated nuclei, pointing to the possibility of an adsorption of this enzyme. 3. In rat liver nuclei isolated in sucrose, lyophilization and treatment with organic solvents revealed only the presence of some dehydrogenase. 4. The washing out of soluble enzymes was most markedly demonstrated in the case of calf liver. Only traces of the nucleoside enzymes were found in the sucrose-isolated nuclei, and in the case of the dehydrogenase only a half of that present in the non-aqueous nucleus remained. The main conclusions drawn were as follows:â€” 1. In sucrose media the nuclear membrane is ineffectual in preventing the inward or outward diffusion of protein. 2. The extent to which soluble proteins are retained by a nucleus isolated in sucrose appears to depend upon internal structural factors, such as the concentration of DNA in the nucleus. 3. With respect to determining the composition of nuclei in terms of soluble components, the sucrose isolation procedure is considered to be of indifferent merit and hence invalid for such a type of analysis.
