Alteration of miRNAs and dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) underlies vascular inflammation. PUFAs are known to be incorporated into the cell membrane of monocytes/macrophages or endothelial cells, the major cellular players of vascular diseases, thereby affecting cellular signal transduction. Nevertheless, there are no investigations concerning the PUFA impact on miRNA expression by these cells. With regard to the key role miRNAs play for overall cellular functionality, this study aims to elucidate whether PUFAs affect miRNA expression profiles. To this end, the monocyte/macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and the endothelial cell line TIME were enriched with either docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; n3-PUFA) or arachidonic acid (AA; n6-PUFA) until reaching a stable incorporation into the plasma membrane and, at least in part, exposed to an inflammatory milieu. Expressed miRNAs were determined by deep sequencing, and compared to unsupplemented/unstimulated controls. Data gained clearly show that PUFAs in fact modulate miRNA expression of both cell types analyzed regardless the presence/absence of an inflammatory stimulator. Moreover, certain miRNAs already linked to vascular inflammation were found to be affected by cellular PUFA enrichment. Hence, vascular inflammation appears to be influenced by dietary fatty acids, inter alia, via PUFA-mediated modulation of the type and amount of miRNAs synthesized by cells involved in the inflammatory process.
