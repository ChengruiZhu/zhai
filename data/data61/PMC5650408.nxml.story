The long-term outcome of 228 patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) who underwent preoperative chemotherapy followed by hepatectomy Â± RFA were retrospectively analyzed. Stratified by chemotherapy response, patients were divided into responding (n=129) and non-responding groups (n=99). Patients who underwent hepatectomy-RFA had a greater number of metastases (median of 4 vs. 2, p=0.000), a higher incidence of bilobar involvement (66.7% vs. 49.1%, p=0.014) and longer chemotherapy cycles (median of 6 vs. 4, p=0.000). In the responding group, the median overall survival (OS) and recurrence free survival (RFS) of hepatectomy-RFA and the hepatectomy alone subgroups were comparable (38.6 months vs. 43.2 months, p=0.824; 8.2 months vs. 11.4 months, p=0.623). In the non-responding group, the median OS and RFS of patients treated with hepatectomy-RFA were significantly shorter (18.5 months vs. 34.2 months, p=0.000; 5.1 months vs. 5.9 months, p=0.002). RFA was identified as the unfavorable independent factor for both OS (HR=3.60, 95%CI=1.81-7.16, p=0.039) and RFS (HR=1.70, 95%CI=1.00-2.86, p=0.048) in non-responsive patients. Local recurrence rate after hepatectomy-RFA was higher in the non-responding group (48.1% vs. 23.6%, p=0.018). Non-response to preoperative chemotherapy may be a contraindication to hepatectomy-RFA in patients with CRLM.
