Epidemiological and experimental findings suggest that the development of gastric cancer (GC) is regulated by steroid hormones. In postmenopausal women and older men, the majority of steroid hormones are produced locally in peripheral tissue through the enzymatic conversion of steroid precursors. Therefore, using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, the mRNA expression of genes encoding steroidogenic enzymes, including steroid sulfatase (STS), hydroxy-delta-5-steroid dehydrogenase 3 beta- and steroid delta-isomerase 1 (HSD3B1), 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 7 and aromatase (CYP19A1), was investigated in primary tumoral and adjacent healthy gastric mucosa from 60 patients with GC. Furthermore, the mRNA levels for estrogen receptor α, estrogen receptor β (ESR2) and androgen receptor (AR), along with their coregulators, including proline, glutamate and leucine rich protein 1, CREB binding protein, nuclear receptor coactivator 1 (NCOA1), nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCOR1) and nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group F member 1 (NR2F1), were investigated. Additionally, the association between the mRNA expression of these genes and the clinicopathological features of patients with GC was examined. Significantly decreased levels of STS, HSD3B1, ESR2, AR, NCOA1 and NCOR1 mRNA, in addition to significantly increased levels of CYP19A1 mRNA were demonstrated in tumoral tissue samples compared with adjacent healthy gastric tissue samples. Deregulated expression of these genes in the analyzed tissue samples was associated with certain clinicopathological features of GC, such as age and localization of the tumor. The results of the current study suggest that all of the genes analyzed are expressed in tumoral and adjacent healthy gastric mucosa. In addition, the results indicate that abnormal expression of STS, ESR2, AR, NCOA1 and NCOR1 may serve a role in the development and progression of GC, and may be associated with specific clinicopathological features in patients with GC.
