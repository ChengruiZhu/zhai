We report the case of an 82-year-old female diagnosed with HER2-negative, hormone receptor (HR)-positive metastatic breast cancer. Upon biochemical disease progression of the initially HR-receptor positive disease under anti-hormonal treatment with tamoxifen and letrozole, she received combination chemotherapy with paclitaxel/gemcitabine. Due to her suffering from severe toxicity, therapy was switched to nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine. From April 22, 2013, to July 15, 2013, the patient received 5 cycles of nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine as a 30-min infusion every 3 weeks, with excellent biochemical responses to treatment. Tumor marker levels as well as bilirubin were reduced to baseline levels. Chemotherapy with nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine was well tolerated. At a follow-up visit immediately after the end of chemotherapy, the patient reported well-being and presented with a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) of 100%. At the last follow-up in October 2013, she was alive with multiple metastatic sites in the liver and bone metastases in the spine without risk of fracture and a KPS of 90%. She has received palliative single agent chemotherapy with capecitabine (14/7 regimen, 1,500 mg b.i.d.) since August 2013 and continued to show a good biochemical treatment response at the last follow-up in October 2013. Since August 2013, the patient has also received denosumab (120 mg sc, q4w) for her metastatic bone disease. As of July 2014, treatment has not been changed and the patient reports her well-being.
