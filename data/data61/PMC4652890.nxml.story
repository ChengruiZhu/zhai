The number of robots in our surroundings is increasing continually. They are used to rescue humans, inspect hazardous terrain or clean our homes. Over the past few decades, they have become more autonomous, safer and cheaper to build. Every autonomous robot needs to navigate in sometimes complex environments without colliding with obstacles along its route. Nowadays, they mostly use active sensors, which induce relatively high energetic costs, to solve this task. Flying insects, however, are able to solve this task by mainly relying on vision. Any agent, both biological and technical, experiences an apparent motion of the environment on the retina, when moving through the environment. The apparent motion contains entangled information of self-motion and of the distance of the agent to objects in the environment. The later is essential for collision avoidance. Extracting the relative distance to objects from geometrical apparent motion is a relatively simple task. However, trying to accomplish this with biological movement detectors, i.e. movement detectors found in the animal kingdom, is tricky, because they do not provide unambiguous velocity information, but are much affected also by the textural properties of the environment. Inspired by the abilities of insects, we developed a parsimonious algorithm to avoid collisions in challenging environments solely based on elementary motion detectors. We coupled our algorithm to a goal direction and then tested it in cluttered environments. The trajectories resulting from this algorithm show interesting goal-directed behavior, such as the formation of a small number of routes, also observed in navigating insects.
