Parameter estimation is a problem of central importance and, perhaps, the most laborious task in biophysical modeling of neurons and neural networks. An emerging trend is to treat parameter estimation in this context as yet another statistical inference problem, which can be tackled using well-established methods from Computational Statistics. Inspired by these recent advances, we adopted a self-organizing state-space-model approach augmented with an adaptive sampling algorithm akin to the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy in order to estimate a large number of parameters in a number of Hodgkin-Huxley-type models of single neurons. Parameter estimation was based on noisy electrophysiological data and involved the maximal conductances, reversal potentials, levels of noise and, unlike most mainstream work, the kinetics of ionic currents in the examined models. Our main conclusion was that parameters in complex, conductance-based neuron models can be inferred using the aforementioned methodology, if sufficiently informative priors regarding the unknown model parameters are available. Importantly, the use of an adaptive algorithm for sampling new parameter vectors significantly reduced the variance of parameter estimates. Flexibility and scalability are additional advantages of the proposed method, which is particularly suited to resolve high-dimensional inference problems.
