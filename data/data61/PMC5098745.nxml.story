Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) is the bypassing agent used in the first-line hemostatic therapy for acquired hemophilia A (AHA); however, the occurrence of thrombotic complications in rFVIIa-treated AHA patients was recently reported to be 2.9–6.5%. Therefore, the investigation of the proper administration of rFVIIa for AHA is needed. In the present study, we retrospectively investigated the clinical features of AHA with regards to the use of rFVIIa (presence or absence of use and total amount) in 7 AHA patients encountered in our department for 7 years between January 2008 and December 2014. Ages were 63–89 years old (median: 79 years old), and there were 5 male and 2 female patients. The coexistence of cardiovascular risk factors and arteriosclerotic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cerebral infarction were present in 6 patients. Anemia progressed to less than 7 g/dL of hemoglobin and required red blood cell transfusion in 5 patients, showing “severe” hemorrhage. Factor VIII inhibitors were removed by immunological treatments in 6 patients. As a hemostatic therapy, rFVIIa was used in 4 patients. rFVIIa was not administered or was administered at a very low dose (20 mg) to 3 and 1 patient, respectively, and bleeding stopped as inhibitor titers decreased and disappeared in these patients. Inhibitors did not disappear in 1 patient and the control of hemostasis became poor and was accompanied by intestinal hemorrhage. Although a large amount of rFVIIa (265 mg in total) was administered, the patient bled to death. Therefore, bleeding may be stopped without the administration of rFVIIa in some AHA cases, while the dose of rFVIIa is not necessarily related to hemostatic effects in other cases. Since the main aim of AHA treatments is the removal of inhibitors, caution is needed to ensure that more than the necessary amount of rFVIIa is not administered.
