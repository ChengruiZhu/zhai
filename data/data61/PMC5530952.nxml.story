All-cause mortality, MACE, and major clinical microvascular events occurred in 2265 (20%), 2166 (19%), and 807 (7%) participants respectively, during a median follow-up of 9.9 (inter-quartile interval 5.6–10.9) years. The adjusted hazard ratios [95% CI] of death, MACE, and major clinical microvascular events were each greater in patients with baseline microvascular disease (1.43 [1.20–1.71], 1.64 [1.37–1.97], and 4.74 [3.86–5.82], respectively), macrovascular disease (1.43 [1.30–1.57], 2.04 [1.86–2.25], and 1.26 [1.06–1.51]) or both (2.01 [1.65–2.45], 2.92 [2.40–3.55], and 6.30 [4.93–8.06]) compared with those without these conditions. No interaction was observed between baseline microvascular and macrovascular disease for these events. The addition of microvascular disease (change in c-statistic [95% CI] 0.005 [0.002–0.008], p = 0.02) or macrovascular disease (0.005 [0.002–0.007], p < 0.0001) considered separately or together (0.011 [0.007–0.014], p < 0.0001) improved the discrimination and the classification (integrated discrimination improvement (IDI): 0.013 [0.010–0.016], p < 0.001; net reclassification improvement (NRI): 0.021 [0.011–0.032], p < 0.001) of the risk of all-cause mortality. Microvascular disease improved discrimination (0.009 [0.003–0.014]) and classification (IDI: 0.008 [0.006–0.010]; NRI: 0.011 [0.001–0.020]) of MACE. Baseline macrovascular disease modestly enhanced IDI (0.002 [0.001–0.002]) and NRI (0.041 [0.002–0.087]), but not discrimination, of major clinical microvascular events.
