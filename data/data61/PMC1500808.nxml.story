The impact of diversity loss on the stability of ecosystems is a central issue in ecology. In today's world the continuous reduction in number of species, subspecies, and locally adapted populations, often with anthropogenic causes, turns it into a matter with increased significance for the scientific community. However, a longstanding debate about the importance of variability of a system for its stability has evoked many theoretical and empirical studies. Here the authors introduce a new approach using experimental bacterial microcosms to address this question. For this study stability is defined as nonstochastic, reproducible population dynamics. The authors started with a low-diversity population and let it diversify until an adaptive event occurred. The superior genotype gradually out-competed all other competitors resulting in a selective sweep. This adaptive event served as reference “state” to test the resilience of the system. The authors investigated the reproducibility of the dynamic with competition experiments by gradual disassembly of the community. Their findings showed an increase in fitness of the superior genotype and less variation among replicate experiments with increasing complexity (number of competitors) of the system. The main implication of this study is that diversity buffers against stochastic effects.
