 1. The course of typhus infection in cotton rats has been described, and a relationship between the dose administered and the time of death has been demonstrated. 2. Rather incomplete pathological studies indicated that typhus in the cotton rat is an acute infection primarily involving mesothelial tissue, and tissues of mesothelial origin. Depending somewhat upon the route of infection, rickettsiae were most easily demonstrated in smears from liver, brain, and pericardial and peritoneal exudates. By subinoculation into the yolk sacs of fertile eggs, rickettsiae were readily isolated from these sources and, with rather less facility, from blood. 3. Although relatively large numbers of rickettsiae were found necessary to produce lethal infections, the susceptibility of the cotton rat as measured by the development of an immunizing infection proved to be very high. The supporting data suggest that cotton rats might be suitable for the isolation of new strains. 4. Contrary to the earlier report (1), age was not found to influence markedly the susceptibility of the cotton rat to lethal infection with any of the strains studied. 5. Comparative studies indicated that cotton rats were just as susceptible to murine infection as white mice and more susceptible to Breinl infection than the latter animal. The susceptibility of cotton rats and of guinea pigs to Breinl infection was found to be about the same. Comparative studies in these animals were not made with other strains. 6. No toxic activity of rickettsial suspensions could be demonstrated for cotton rats, although suspensions of infected cotton rat livers were shown to be toxic for mice. 7. A method has been described by which three strains of
