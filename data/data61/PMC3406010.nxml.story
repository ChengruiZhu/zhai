Introgression is a process by which genetic material from one species becomes infiltrated into another, genetically distinct species. Introgression usually occurs via sexual reproduction: individuals of two species mate and produce a hybrid offspring, then the offspring repeatedly backcross with one of the parental species. Introgression has long been recognized as a key process in evolution, as it may contribute to speciation, diversification, and adaptation to new environments. The importance and prevalence of introgression has been well established in plant and animal systems, and in this study we use a fungal model system, Neurospora, to study the introgression at the genomic level. We gathered genomic data from six genomes, and by comparative genomics we revealed genetic transfer of DNA regions of unprecedentedly large sizes, covering over 50% of the mating-type chromosomes, and used phylogenetic analyses to reveal the origin and direction of the transfer. Introgression was found solely on the mating-type chromosomes, which contradicts theoretical predictions for sex-determining chromosomes. We argue that this unexpected pattern is due to the fact that fungi do not have differentiated sexes (female/male) and thereby are free from sex-biased evolutionary forces. Instead, we suggest that introgression between fungal species may result in reinvigoration of genomic regions exposed to suppressed recombination.
