The development of mouse submandibular gland (SMG) begins at embryonic day 11.5–12 (E11.5–12), during which successive rounds of epithelial clefting and branching create complex epithelial tree-like structures. Homeobox genes regulate place-dependent morphogenesis, including epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, and control the expression patterns of signaling molecules. The Barx2 containing Homeobox exerts several key roles in development. Some studies have shown that the Barx2 plays important roles in the epithelial-mesenchymal interactions of organogenesis. However, the mechanisms of Barx2 associated with the development of SMG are obscure. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time the exact spatial and temporal Barx2 expression pattern in SMG epithelial tissue during development using immunohistochemical staining and Real-Time quantitative PCR. Barx2 was expressed in the nucleus of the epithelial cells located in the proliferative and differentiative regions of the developing SMG during the early development stages (E11.5–E13.5). After the E14.5-time period, the expression gradually decreased, and at E16.5, expression mostly disappeared despite the fact that evidence of cytodifferentiation, such as the appearance of proacinar cells, distinct lumen formation, and secretory products, was beginning to be observed. Results of Real-Time PCR demonstrated that the amount of
