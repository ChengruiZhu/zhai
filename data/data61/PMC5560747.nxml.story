Significant efforts have been devoted in recent years to the development of machine learning models to support different stages of drug development process. Given the enormous size of the chemical universe, such models could offer a complementary and cost-effective means to experimental determination of drug-target interactions, toward prioritization of the most potent ones for further verification in the laboratory. In order to demonstrate the benefits of the prediction models in practical application cases, we carefully evaluated the predictive power of a well-established machine learning model in filling the gaps in existing profiling studies and prediction of target interactions for a new drug candidate. As a specific case study, we focused on kinase inhibitors, which form the largest class of new drugs approved for cancer treatment, but are also known to have wide multi-target activities contributing both to their therapeutic and toxic responses. The high agreement observed between the predicted and experimentally-measured drug-target bioactivities under the implemented rigorous validation setup demonstrates the potential of the machine learning approach, not only for filling the gaps in existing drug-target interaction maps, but also toward off-target interaction prediction for investigational drugs, and finding potential new uses for already approved drugs (drug repurposing).
