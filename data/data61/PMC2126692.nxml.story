. In addition to the ultimate curative results obtained with single doses within the curative range, it is important to consider the marked therapeutic action with smaller single doses, as shown by the rapid regression and healing of the clinical lesions of the acute infections produced by all five species of trypanosomes together with a marked improvement in the general physical state of the animal. Moreover, large single doses, above those of the so called curative range, caused no disturbance of a toxic nature and were apparently well borne. A system of repeated dose therapy may be employed with advantage in the treatment of both initial and relapsed infections in rabbits, especially in those instances in which there is induration or even necrosis of tissues with weakness and emaciation of the animal host. The factor of time of repetition or the spacing of doses is in our experience as important as that of size of the dose employed and depends upon the rate, degree, and duration of action of the particular dose of the drug in question. Since the amide of -arsonic add apparently possesses the power of tissue penetration to a marked degree, it is desirable to give the second dose within a short time after the first in order that it may have a full opportunity for the immediate and complete development of its action. The repetition of small doses such as 0.15 gm. per kilo of body weight on successive or alternate days has given successful results as regards both the immediate regression and healing of lesions and ultimate permanent cures in severe, chronic infections. It is possible, however, to administer increasingly large doses, if this is necessary, since infected as well as normal rabbits exhibit a remarkable tolerance to repeated large doses of the drug. The therapeutic activity of small doses administered intramuscularly is quite comparable with that observed after similar doses given intravenously, as indicated by the rate of regression and healing of clinical lesions, while such effects proceed somewhat more slowly after subcutaneous injections. Permanent cures have been obtained in
