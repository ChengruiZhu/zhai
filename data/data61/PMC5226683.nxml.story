The contribution of epistasis to human biology and complex trait architecture has been subject to intense debate. Despite statistical methods to detect interaction, allele frequencies and study designs have limited our power to address this question. Rather than a statistically-motivated approach, we developed a reverse pathway genetic approach to detect epistasis in in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Instead of traditional pathway analysis—exploiting unbiased genetic results to identify biological pathways important for pathophysiology—we hypothesized that the reverse approach of leveraging a specific biological pathway to uncover novel aspects of genetic architecture could be fruitful. We drew on knowledge from Mendelian disorders of the Ras/MAPK pathway (RASopathies) associated with ASD to inform our analyses. First, we implemented an epistasis screen in idiopathic ASD for SNPs that interact with the Ras/MAPK pathway, allowing us to detect genome-wide enrichment in epistasis signal as well as specific interacting loci. Second, we performed modifier mapping within RASopathies and identified overlapping signals with our first approach. Finally, we took the top overlapping region and experimentally demonstrated dysregulated expression in iPSC-derived neural cells from RASopathy subjects. Together, our results establish a human genetics motivated reverse-pathway strategy, which can be applied broadly to study epistasis.
