Chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia is a common bleeding risk in cancer patients and limits chemotherapy dose and frequency. Recent data from mouse and human platelets revealed that activation of protein kinase A/G (PKA/PKG) not only inhibited thrombin/convulxin-induced platelet activation but also prevented the platelet pro-coagulant state. Here we investigated whether or not PKA/PKG activation could attenuate caspase-dependent apoptosis induced by the anti-cancer drugs ABT-737 (the precursor of navitoclax) and thymoquinone (TQ), thereby potentially limiting chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia. This is particularly relevant as activation of cyclic nucleotide signalling in combination chemotherapy is an emerging strategy in cancer treatment. However, PKA/PKG-activation, as monitored by phosphorylation of Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), did not block caspase-3-dependent platelet apoptosis induced by the compounds. In contrast, both substances induced PKA activation themselves and PKA activation correlated with platelet inhibition and apoptosis. Surprisingly, ABT-737- and TQ-induced VASP-phosphorylation was independent of cAMP levels and neither cyclases nor phosphatases were affected by the drugs. In contrast, however, ABT-737- and TQ-induced PKA activation was blocked by caspase-3 inhibitors. In conclusion, we show that ABT-737 and TQ activate PKA in a caspase-3-dependent manner, which correlates with platelet inhibition and apoptosis and therefore potentially contributes to the bleeding risk in chemotherapy patients.
