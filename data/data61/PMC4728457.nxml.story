We recently developed Kochi Oxydol-Radiation Therapy for Unresectable Carcinomas (KORTUC) as a strategy to increase intratumoral oxygen concentrations and degrade antioxidant enzymes such as peroxidase and catalase. We then developed KORTUC II, which uses sodium hyaluronate containing hydrogen peroxide as a radiosensitizer. KORTUC II requires twice-weekly administration to sustain its effects, but decreasing the frequency of radiosensitizer injections to once-weekly would reduce the burden on the patients and the physicians. The goal of this study was thus to develop a new formulation of KORTUC (New KORTUC) that only requires once-weekly administration. We performed experimental studies using a mouse tumor model and biodegradable hydrogel. C3H/He mice were allocated to control, KORTUC, or hydrogel groups. At 72 h after injection, each tumor was irradiated with a 6 MeV electron beam to a total dose of 30 Gy. During a 62-day observation period, changes in tumor volume and survival rates were assessed in each group. Tumor growth rate was slowest in the hydrogel groups. These data suggest that hydrogel could represent a useful adjunct as a long-acting radiosensitizer in place of sodium hyaluronate. New KORTUC, which contains hydrogen peroxide and hydrogel, exerted a radiosensitizing effect that persisted beyond 72 h following injection of the agent. Use of this new formulation allows radiosensitizer injections to be performed once-weekly with good effect.
