Schizophrenia is a disorder caused by multiple genetic and environmental variables. Despite the disease's heterogeneous causes, current hypotheses suggest that dysfunction of dopamine signaling in the brain is one of the final common pathways involved. One gene that may be involved encodes the protein kinase Akt, which is regulated by hormones, growth factors, and neurotransmitter receptors. In this study, we examined the potential molecular mechanisms linking Akt dysregulation to cortical hypodopaminergia, and ultimately to the pathology of schizophrenia. Using transgenic technology, we generated a mouse model with defective neuronal Akt signaling. Neurochemical and behavioral phenotypes associated with schizophrenia include decreases in prefrontal dopamine signaling and deficits in sensorimotor gating, two phenotypes we observed in our transgenic animals. Further, we observed that impaired cortical Akt activity significantly enhanced norepinephrine transporter function. Interestingly, we found that by blocking this transporter, we could reverse the cortical hypodopaminergia and behavioral deficits seen in our transgenic mice. The norepinephrine transporter is a presynaptic membrane protein that is critical for maintaining both norepinephrine and cortical dopamine homeostasis. Taken together, this work supports the potential for targeting both Akt and the norepinephrine transporter for treating dopamine-related mood disorders.
