Influenza, or the flu, is a significant public health burden in the U.S. that annually causes between 3,000 and 49,000 deaths. Predictions of influenza, if reliable, would provide public health officials valuable advanced warning that could aid efforts to reduce the burden of this disease. For instance, medical resources, including vaccines and antiviral drugs, can be distributed to areas in need well in advance of peak influenza incidence. Recent applications of statistical filtering methods to epidemiological models have shown that accurate and reliable influenza forecast is possible; however, many filtering methods exist, and the performance of any filter may be application dependent. Here we use a single epidemiological modeling framework to test the performance of six state-of-the-art filters for modeling and forecasting influenza. Three of the filters are particle filters, commonly used in scientific, engineering, and economic disciplines; the other three filters are ensemble filters, frequently used in geophysical disciplines, such as numerical weather prediction. We use each of the six filters to retrospectively model and forecast seasonal influenza activity during 2003â€“2012 for 115 cities in the U.S. We report the performance of the six filters and discuss potential strategies for improving real-time influenza prediction.
