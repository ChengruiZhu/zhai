Of the 652 naive patients who started ART, 164 changed regimens. The majority had HIV-1 infection (n=158). The mean age was 43.9 years (standard deviation±14.3), with a male predominance of 57.9%. Regimens with efavirenz were the most common amongst HIV-1 patients (50%) followed by lopinavir/r (22%). In HIV-2 patients, lopinavir/r (n=3) regimens were most prevalent. First ART regimens had a mean duration of 12.1 months. There was no difference between NNRTI (59.8%) and protease inhibitor (40.2%) schemes regarding durability. Adverse reactions were the major cause of ART switching (55.5%) followed by therapy resistance (12.1%). Age was inversely related to durability (p=0.007 Mann-Whitney, Phi coefficient −0.161) and associated with the appearance of adverse reactions (p=0.04, Chi-square). Younger patients had a reduced risk of adverse reactions by 27%. Adverse reactions increased the risk of inferior durability by 40%. Psychiatric symptoms (28.4%) were the most prevalent, all attributed to efavirenz. The year of ART initiation was associated with different durability rates (p=0.005, Mann-Whitney). Patients started on ART before the year 2010 reduced the probability of inferior ART duration by 25.8%. After second-line ART regimens, TCD4+ counts>500 cell/µL were increased by 38% and favourable virologic outcome achieved in 84%.
