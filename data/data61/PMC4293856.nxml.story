This case highlights the use of a custom-made distractor (Synthes GmbH, Oberdorf, Switzerland), used to increase bone height prior to rehabilitation with implant placement, in a patient following excision of an ameloblastoma and reconstruction of her mandible with a fibular flap. A 27-year-old patient had her mandible reconstructed following wide resection of an ameloblastoma. Although a 2.0 LOCK reconstruction plate (Synthes GmbH, Oberdorf, Switzerland) was used for fixation of the fibular bone, the vertical deficiency between the reconstructed segment and the occlusal plane made oral rehabilitation impossible. To overcome this, the fibular bone segment was vertically distracted following a latency period of 4 days. Distractor was left in place for 20 weeks for bone consolidation. Following device removal implants were placed. The novelty of this approach included fixation of the lower arm of the distractor on the LOCK plate. The distractor was unidirectional with two arms of different length. The lower arm composed of a 2.0 mini-plate to fit exactly on the 2.0 LOCK plate whereas the upper arm used a standard 1.5 mini-plate. Advantages of this custom-made distractor included: (i) No need for removal of the reconstruction plate, (ii) no need for an extraoral surgical approach, and (iii) no need for additional drilling to fit the lower arm of the distractor. Technical details and limitations are presented.
