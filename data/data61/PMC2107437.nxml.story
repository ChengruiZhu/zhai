C-labeled amino acids had 10â€“20 times more acid-precipitable radioactivity associated with them than polysomes from adult kidneys similarly labeled. Between 3 and 6 days after birth the rate incorporation of labeled amino acids by polyribosomes from neonatal kidneys declined sharply to only twice the value found for adult kidneys. There was no change in the shape of the polyribosome profile with increasing age, but before birth few, if any, ribosomes were bound to membranes compared with 20% 2 days after birth and between 20 and 30% in the adult. Total protein represented less than 10% of the wet weight in the fetal kidney but increased to 17% of the wet weight in the adult kidney. There was a steady decline in the concentration of RNA and DNA with respect to dry weight throughout kidney development. DNA concentration declined more rapidly than RNA concentration, so that the milligram to milligram ratio of RNA to DNA increased. In males the RNA/DNA ratio was stable at 1.3 at 40 days after birth; but in females the decline in DNA concentration was more protracted, and at 200 days after birth the RNA/DNA ratio was only 0.99. Thus, total nucleic acids show only gradual changes in concentration throughout development of the kidney, but a sharp change in the synthetic activity of the ribosomes and in their binding to membranes occurs in kidneys soon after birth.
