Polyamines have been widely investigated as potential biomarkers for various types of cancers, including lung cancer, which is one of the most common causes of death from cancer worldwide. This study was carried out to evaluate the value of polyamines that serve as early diagnostic and cancer progression markers as well as drug evaluation for lung cancer (squamous cell carcinoma of lung, SCCL). SCCL was induced in Wistar rats by intratracheal instillation of 3-methylcholanthrene and treated with three different anti-cancer drugs, Aidi injections, fluorouracil, and a combination of them. After carcinogenesis for 28, 70 and 98 days and therapy for 28 and 56 days, the polyamine levels in plasma of SCCL, healthy and treated rats were determined using a UHPLC-MS/MS assay base on the means of targeted metabolomics. Results showed that increased N-acetylputrescine, cadaverine and 1,3-diaminopropane levels were associated with progression of SCCL. The levels of cadaverine and 1,3-diaminopropane returned to normal after administration of the three different kinds of anticancer drug. In addition, the suitability of using N-acetylputrescine, cadaverine and 1,3-diaminopropane as biomarkers was confirmed by PLS-DA and ROC analysis. It can provide an innovative and effective way for the clinical diagnosis, prevention and treatment of lung cancer, and stimulate a theoretical basis for the design and development of new anticancer drugs. At the same time, this increased the clinical options for polyamines as cancer biomarkers.
