A seven years old male patient admitted with the complaints of limitation in the right knee joint and difficulty in walking. Physical and radiological examinations of the patient were performed, and patient hospitalized with CPD preliminary diagnosis. The right knee joint flexion and extension range of motions were significantly limited when compared with left knee joint. Range of motion of knee flexion was 100° and limitation of extension was 30°. Also the patient had difficulty in walking due to weakness of extensor mechanism. The patella located laterally to the lateral femoral condyle, and it was in fixed position by palpation. Reduction of patella wasn’t achieved by passive flexion and extension of knee. The patella was sited laterally to the lateral femoral condyle in anteroposterior (AP) knee radiography. And in tangential radiography; it was seen that the patella dislocated to the lateral side. And also, there was insufficiency in the development of patellar femoral surface, and trochlear dysplasia was observed. According to these physical and radiological findings patient was operated with the diagnosis of CPD and modified Roux-Goldthwait surgical technique was performed. Postoperatively patient followed in long leg cast that is performed in 30° knee flexion and internal rotation. Any complications were not seen at the follow-up of patient.
