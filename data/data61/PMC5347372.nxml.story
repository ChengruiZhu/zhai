In order to survive, many organisms must not only be able to detect the presence of a chemical compound, but also in which direction that compound increases or decreases in concentration. For example, bacteria cells prefer to move towards areas with high sugar concentrations. The process by which cells determine the direction of a chemical gradient is called “Gradient Sensing”. Of particular interest is the gradient sensing capability of yeast cells. These cells have been observed detecting the direction of extremely shallow gradients, which produce only a 2% difference in the number of molecules across the cell. Because the molecular-level noise is much larger than this signal, it is unclear what noise-reduction mechanism the cell employs to reduce the noise and detect the signal. We developed a 3D computational simulation platform to calculate and study the exact positions of molecules during this process. Our platform utilizes High Performance Computing clusters and GPGPUs. We find that, of the two prevailing models in the literature, neither time-averaging nor receptor endocytosis sufficiently reduces molecular noise for yeast cells to reliably detect chemical gradients before they initiate polarized growth. This finding implies yeast must possess a mechanism for reorienting the direction of growth after cell polarization has occurred. We also find the cell membrane and similarly, any other physical barrier nearby the cell can improve the cell’s likelihood of detecting the gradient. Our simulation methods and results will be applicable in other areas of research.
