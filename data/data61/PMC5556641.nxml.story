Lymphangiogenesis plays an important role in cancer metastasis. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) migrate to the site of tumorigenesis and in turn promote the metastasis. However, whether BMMSCs involve in the lymphangiogenesis of lung cancer is unclear. Jinfukang has clinically been used for the treatment of non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in China. In this study, to investigate the involvement of BMMSCs in lymphangiogenesis in lung cancer, and evaluate the inhibitory effect of Jinfukang on the lymphangiogenesis, chimeric mice were prepared by transplanting bone marrow from green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic mice (C57BL/6-EGFP) into irradiated C57BL/6 mice. Then, the chimeric mice were injected subcutaneously with freshly prepared Lewis lung carcinoma cell suspension to make lung tumor model, and the model mice were further orally administrated with Jinfukang once per day for 3 weeks. Four weeks after the bone marrow transplantation, GFP-positive cells primarily existed in bone marrow of acceptor mice, and three more weeks after, Lewis lung carcinoma cells formed a tumor mass in chimeric mice. Observation of GFP-positive cells revealed that BMMSCs transferred into the lung tumor. Immunofluorescent analyses of lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor-1 (LYVE-1), a lymphatic endothelium marker, demonstrated a part of lymphatic endothelial cells in lung cancer were derived from BMMSCs, and those lymphatic endothelial cells contributed to the lung tumor lymphangiogenesis. Furthermore, Jinfukang treatment resulted in a significant reduction of the average weight of the tumor mass in chimeric mice, and displayed a significant lower number of LYVE-1 positive cells. The present results suggest that BMMSCs transfer to tumor, differentiate into lymphatic endothelial cells, and involve in the lymphangiogenesis in lung cancer of mice. Jinfukang inhibits the lung tumor mass via suppression of the BMMSCs transformation and lung tumor lymphangiogenesis. Our findings might provide the potential for the cancer therapies.
