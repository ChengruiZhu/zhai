This study sought to compare the extent and pattern of burden experienced by relatives of two different patient groups, one with affective disorders and the other with schizophrenia. Cross-sectional assessment of family burden using the Pai and Kapur's Interview Schedule was done in 78 patients with either bipolar disorder or recurrent major depression and 60 patients with schizophrenia diagnosed according to DSM-III. The inter-rater reliability of the interview schedule for burden was also undertaken prior to the assessment of burden in the main study sample. Doth groups were similar with regard to sociodemographic variables, duration of illness and dysfunction of patient except for lower mean age and greater number of single patients in schizophrenia group. The extent of both objective and subjective burden was significantly more in relatives of schizophrenics. The pattern of burden was, however, almost similar in both the groups. Burden was principally fell in the areas of family routine, family leisure, family interaction and finances. The emotional health of the family was relatively untouched and the impact on physical health of the caring relatives due to burden of care was almost negligible. Various sociodemographic and clinical variables related to burden as well as the implication of the findings of the study are discussed.
