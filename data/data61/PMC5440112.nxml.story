Recent research shows that energy metabolism can strongly influence proteostasis and thereby affect onset of aging and related disease such as Parkinson’s disease (PD). Changes in glycolytic and proteolytic activities (influenced by diet and development) are suggested to synergistically create a self-reinforcing deleterious cycle via enhanced formation of triose phosphates (dihydroxyacetone-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate) and their decomposition product methylglyoxal (MG). It is proposed that triose phosphates and/or MG contribute to the development of PD and its attendant pathophysiological symptoms. MG can induce many of the macromolecular modifications (e.g. protein glycation) which characterise the aged-phenotype. MG can also react with dopamine to generate a salsolinol-like product, 1-acetyl-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinaline (ADTIQ), which accumulates in the Parkinson’s disease (PD) brain and whose effects on mitochondria, analogous to MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), closely resemble changes associated with PD. MG can directly damage the intracellular proteolytic apparatus and modify proteins into non-degradable (cross-linked) forms. It is suggested that increased endogenous MG formation may result from either, or both, enhanced glycolytic activity and decreased proteolytic activity and contribute to the macromolecular changes associated with PD. Carnosine, a naturally-occurring dipeptide, may ameliorate MG-induced effects due, in part, to its carbonyl-scavenging activity. The possibility that ingestion of highly glycated proteins could also contribute to age-related brain dysfunction is briefly discussed.
