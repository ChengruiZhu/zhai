Reprogramming of somatic cells to different extents has been reported using different methods. However, this is normally accompanied by the use of exogenous materials, and the overall reprogramming efficiency has been low. Chemicals and small molecules have been used to improve the reprogramming process during somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell generation. We report here the first application of a combined epigenetic and non-genetic approach for reprogramming somatic cells, i.e., DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, and human embryonic stem cell (hESC) extracts. When somatic cells were pretreated with these inhibitors before exposure to hESC (MEL1) extracts, morphological analysis revealed a higher rate of hESC-like colony formation than without pretreatment. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) demonstrated that pluripotency genes were upregulated when compared to those of somatic cells or treated with hESC extracts alone. Overall changes in methylation and acetylation levels of pretreated somatic cells suggests that epigenetic states of the cells have an effect on reprogramming efficiency induced by hESC extracts. KnockOutserum replacement (KOSRâ„¢) medium (KO-SR) played a positive role in inducing expression of the pluripotency genes. hESC extracts could be an alternative approach to reprogram somatic cells without introducing exogenous materials. The epigenetic pre-treatment of somatic cells could be used to improve the efficiency of reprogramming process. Under differentiation conditions, the reprogrammed cells exhibited differentiation ability into neurons suggesting that, although fully reprogramming was not achieved, the cells could be transdifferentiated after reprogramming.
