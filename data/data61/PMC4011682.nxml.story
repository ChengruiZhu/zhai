The neural crest is a highly migratory population of embryonic cells, which requires Wnt signaling at several stages to promote migration and cell fate decisions. Intracellular trafficking of Wnt receptors and associated proteins can affect the timing and intensity of Wnt signaling. An obvious question is whether proton pumps and/or their partner proteins that are associated with intracellular vesicles might have a role in intracellular trafficking, Wnt signaling, and cell migration/adhesion. In this study we demonstrate such a role for Rabconnectin-3a, a protein associated with the vacuolar-ATPase (v-ATPase) proton pump complex. Loss of Rabconnectin-3a in zebrafish embryos disrupts the maturation of endocytic vesicles in neural crest cells, which has two effects: (1) decreasing Wnt signaling in these cells before migration and (2) increasing Wnt signaling after migration. Prior to migration, endosomes that fail to mature reduce Wnt signaling in neural crest cells and disrupt the localization and expression of cadherins, membrane-bound cell adhesion molecules required for these cells to initiate an epithelial-mesenchymal transition. At later stages, however, Wnt receptors accumulate at the membranes of unmigrated neural crest cells due to defective endocytosis, which correlates with high levels of Wnt signaling. Interestingly, Rabconnectin-3a-deficient neural crest cells that fail to migrate become pigment cells, presumably due to elevated Wnt signaling. Rabconnectin-3a may have a conserved role in endosomal maturation, Wnt signaling, and cell migration in many other cell populations.
