 flagella and other materials. The antigen was taken up vigorously, and to an approximately equal extent, by both primary and secondary follicles. The rate of uptake was faster in preimmunized than in virgin adult rats. The bulk of the antigen in follicles was extracellular, and persisted in this location for at least 3 wk. Label was most frequently found at or near the surface of fine cell processes. Many of these were branches of dendritic follicular reticular cells. Such processes interdigitated with equally fine processes of lymphocytes, creating an elaborate meshwork. In some cases, antigen was found between lymphocytes which appeared to be in close apposition. Occasionally, a few grains appeared over lymphocyte nuclei and study of serial sections suggested that this probably represented true entry of small amounts of antigen into lymphocytes. The characteristic "tingible body" macrophages (TBM) of germinal centers appeared to play only a secondary role in follicular antigen retention. They showed degrees of labeling over their phagocytic inclusions varying from negligible to moderately heavy. Moreover, follicles lacking or poor in TBM retained antigen just as effectively as those containing numerous TBM. The hypothesis is advanced that TBM may be derived from monocytes that migrate down from the circular sinus. Follicular localization of three other materials was also studied, though not in such detail. These were
