The Cytochrome P450 enzymes are commonly known for their major role in metabolism. Besides its metabolic role, CYP2E1 gene expression has been associated with the onset of diabetic nephropathy. CYP2E1 protein elevation has also been reported to be responsible for the production of reactive oxygen species. The aims of this study were (i) to optimize and validate a targeted proteomic approach for quantitating CYP2E1 and validating it as a suitable clinical test, (ii) to investigate the concurrency between ESI-LCMS-MS quantitated circulating CYP2E1 and gold standard indices in the context of outpatient point-of-care clinical settings involving various groups of diabetic patients and (iii) to investigate the concurrency profile of circulating CYP2E1 protein, CYP2E1 gene expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS). This is a cross sectional study involving three groups of subjects (n = 166): control, pre-diabetes, and diabetes. We optimized a targeted proteomic approach for absolute quantification of CYP2E1. “YPEIEEK” and “GTVVVPTLYDNQEFPDPEK” were the representative peptides of CYP2E1 for our analytical method. Deuterated forms of “YPEIEEK” and “GTVVVPTLYDNQEFPDPEK” were used as internal standards. Lymphocytes were isolated from whole blood, microsomes were prepared, followed by in-solution digestion for production of tryptic peptides. Amounts of “YPEIEEK” and “GTVVVPTLYDNQEFPDPEK” from patients’ samples were calculated from a calibration curve.
