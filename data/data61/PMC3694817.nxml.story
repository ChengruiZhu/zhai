 (GBS) is the leading cause of neonatal invasive diseases and pili, as long filamentous fibers protruding from the bacterial surface, have been discovered as important virulence factors and potential vaccine candidates. The bacterial surface is the main interface between host and pathogen, and the ability of the host to identify molecular determinants that are unique to pathogens has a crucial role for microbial clearance. Here, we describe a strategy to investigate the immunological and structural proprieties of a protective pilus protein, by elucidating the molecular mechanisms, in terms of single residue contributions, by which functional epitopes guide bacterial clearance. We generated neutralizing monoclonal antibodies raised against the protein and identified the epitope region in the antigen. Then, we performed computational docking analysis of the antibodies in complex with the target antigen and identified specific residues on the target protein that mediate hydrophobic interactions at the binding interface. Our results suggest that a perfect balance of shape and charges at the binding interface in antibody/antigen interactions is crucial for the antibody/antigen complex in driving a successful neutralizing response. Knowing the native molecular architecture of protective determinants might be useful to selectively engineer the antigens for effective vaccine formulations.
