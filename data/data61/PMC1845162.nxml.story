Regulation of intracellular signaling depends on the precise operation of molecular switches such as kinases and phosphatases. Disruption of their activities leads to inappropriate cellular proliferation, growth, and survival. Protein kinase B (PKB) is a critical kinase that regulates events downstream of growth factor receptors. It is also involved in human cancer, where its overexpression induces malignant transformation. We studied the molecular mechanisms of PKB's interaction with its upstream regulator, 3-phosphoinositide–dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1). By using a fluorescent probe, we monitored the conformational changes of PKB in cells using Förster resonance energy transfer detected by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. Applying this approach, we show that PKB and PDK1 are found as complexes in the cytoplasm. Despite this proximity to its regulator, we show that PKB remains inactive through an intramolecular interaction of its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and kinase domain. We refer to this inactive state as the “PH-in” conformer. Following growth factor activation, PKB changes conformation to the “PH-out” conformer and is phosphorylated by PDK1. The active “PH-out” conformer dissociates from the plasma membrane to phosphorylate downstream proteins. Our in vivo studies provide a new model for the mechanism of PKB.
