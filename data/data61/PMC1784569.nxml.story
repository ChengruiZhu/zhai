Genito-urinary tract or systemic infections of the gram-negative bacteria in pregnant women, causes abortions, preterm labor, and several other perinatal complications. LPS is the most potent antigenic component of the gram-negative bacterial cell wall and is known to modulate the expression of various proinflammatory cytokines. Here we investigate the role of the soluble form of IL-1 i.e., IL-1beta in the 'minimum dose' of LPS induced pregnancy loss in mice. Uterine cross-sections on each day of the preimplantation period of pregnancy were examined histopathologically for finding out LPS induced changes in the uterine preparation for embryo implantation. The expression of IL-1beta in the various stages of the preimplantation period of pregnancy was studied by RT-PCR in the embryos and the uterine horns of the LPS treated and normal pregnant mice. We found that LPS significantly alters the proliferation of the glandular epithelium, luminal epithelium and stroma during the preimplantation period. We also found large infiltration of macrophages into the uterine horns of the LPS treated animals. The level and pattern of IL-1beta expression in the preimplantation embryos and uterine horns were also altered in LPS treated animals. These observations indicate that LPS can alter the uterine preparation for blastocyst implantation, which could be due to the change in the IL-1beta expression in the uterine horns. However, a change in the expression pattern of IL-1beta in the preimplantation embryos underlines the significance of this molecule in LPS induced pregnancy loss or implantation failure in mouse.
