Titanium (Ti) mesh plates are used as a bone replacement in brain tumor surgeries. In the case of radiotherapy, these plates might interfere with the beam path. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of titanium mesh on the dose distribution of electron fields. Simulations were performed using Monte Carlo BEAMnrc and DOSXYZnrc codes for 6 and 10 MeV electron beams. In Monte Carlo simulation, the shape of the titanium mesh was simulated. The simulated titanium mesh was considered as the one which is used in head and neck surgery with a thickness of 0.055 cm. First, by simulation, the percentage depth dose was obtained while the titanium mesh was present, and these values were then compared with the depth dose of homogeneous phantom with no titanium mesh. In the experimental measurements, the values of depth dose with titanium mesh and without titanium mesh in various depths were measured. The experiments were performed using a RW3 phantom with GAFCHROMIC EBT2 film. The results of experimental measurements were compared with values of depth dose obtained by simulation. In Monte Carlo simulation, as well as experimental measurements, for the voxels immediately beyond the titanium mesh, the change of the dose were evaluated. For this purpose the ratio of the dose for the case with titanium to the case without titanium was calculated as a function of titanium depth. For the voxels before the titanium mesh there was always an increase of the dose up to 13% with respect to the same voxel with no titanium mesh. This is because of the increased back scattering effect of the titanium mesh. The results also showed that for the voxel right beyond the titanium mesh, there is an increased or decreased dose to soft tissues, depending on the depth of the titanium mesh. For the regions before the depth of maximum dose, there is an increase of the dose up to 10% compared to the dose of the same depth in homogeneous phantom. Beyond the depth of maximum dose, there was a 16% decrease in dose. For both 6 and 10 MeV, before the titanium mesh, there was always an increase in dose. If titanium mesh is placed in buildup region, it causes an increase of the dose and could lead to overdose of the adjacent tissue, whereas if titanium mesh is placed beyond the buildup region, it would lead to a decrease in dose compared to the homogenous tissue.
