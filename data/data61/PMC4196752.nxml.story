Obstacles to the progression of DNA replication forks can result in genome rearrangements that are often observed in cancer cells and genomic disorders. Homologous recombination is a mechanism of restarting stalled replication fork that involves synthesis of the new DNA strands switching templates to a second (allelic) copy of the DNA sequence. However, the new strands can also occasionally recombine with nonallelic repeats (distinct regions of the genome that resemble the correct one) and thereby cause the inappropriate fusion of normally distant DNA segments; this is known as faulty template switching. The chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) is already known to be involved in depositing nucleosomes on DNA during DNA replication and repair. We have found that CAF-1 is also involved in the recombination-mediated template switch pathway in response to replication stress. Using both genetic and physical assays that allow the different steps of template switch to be analyzed, we reveal that CAF-1 protects recombination intermediates from disassembly by the RecQ-type helicase Rqh1, the homologue of BLM (people with mutations that affect BLM have Bloom's syndrome, an inherited predisposition to genome instability and cancer). Consequently, the likelihood of faulty template switch is controlled by the antagonistic activities of CAF-1 and Rqh1. We thus identified an evolutionarily conserved interplay between CAF-1 and RecQ-type helicases that helps to maintain genome stability in the face of replication stress.
