Various vaccine treatments against metastatic colorectal cancer have been developed and applied. However, to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy, biomarkers that can predict the effects are needed. It has been reported that various microRNAs (miRNAs) in peripheral blood may be useful as non-invasive biomarkers. In this study, miRNAs influencing the efficacy of vaccine treatment were screened for in a microarray analysis of 13 plasma samples that were obtained from patients prior to vaccine treatment. To validate the screening results, real-time RT-PCR was performed using 93 plasma samples obtained from patients prior to vaccine treatment. Four candidate miRNAs were selected according to the results of the comprehensive analysis of miRNA expression, which were ranked using the Fisher criterion and the absolute value of the log2 ratio in the screening analysis. The validation analysis showed that in the HLA-A*2402-matched patient group (vaccine-treated group), patients with a high expression of plasma miR-6826 had a poorer prognosis than those with a low expression (P=0.048). In contrast, in the HLA-A*2402-unmatched patient group (control group), there was no difference between the patients with high or low plasma miR-6826 expression (P=0.168). Similar results were obtained in the analysis of miR-6875 (P=0.029 and P=0.754, respectively). Moreover, multivariate analysis of the Cox regression model indicated that the expression of miR-6826 was the most significant predictor for overall survival (P=0.003, hazard ratio, 3.670). In conclusion, plasma miR-6826 and miR-6875 may be predictive biomarkers for a poor response to vaccine treatment. Although further clarification is needed regarding the functions of miR-6826 and miR-6875 and their relationship to immune-related molecules, plasma miR-6826 and miR-6875 may be useful negative biomarkers for predicting the efficacy of vaccine treatment.
