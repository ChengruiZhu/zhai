To design and conduct a survey analyzing pre-, intra- and post- hip arthroscopy practice patterns among hip arthroscopists worldwide. A 21-question, IRB-exempt, HIPAA-compliant, cross-sectional survey was conducted via email using SurveyMonkey to examine pre-operative evaluation, intra-operative techniques and post-operative management. The survey was administered internationally to 151 hip arthroscopists identified from publicly available sources. Seventy-five respondents completed the survey (151 ± 116 hip arthroscopy procedures per year; 8.6 ± 7.1 years hip arthroscopy experience). Standing AP pelvis, false profile and Dunn 45 were the most common radiographs utilized. CT scans were utilized by 54% of surgeons at least some of the time. Only 56% of participants recommended an arthrogram with MRI. Nearly all surgeons either never (40%) or infrequently (58%) performed arthroscopy in Tönnis grade-2 or grade-3 osteoarthritis. Surgeons rarely performed hip arthroscopy on patients with dysplasia (51% never; 44% infrequently). Only 25% of participants perform a routine ‘T’ capsulotomy and 41% close the capsule if the patient is at risk for post-operative instability. Post-operatively, 52% never use a brace, 39% never use a continuous passive motion, 11% never recommended heterotopic ossification prophylaxis and 30% never recommended formal thromboembolic disease prophylaxis. Among a large number of high-volume experienced hip arthroscopists worldwide, pre-, intra- and post- hip arthroscopy practice patterns have been established and reported. Within this cohort of respondents, several areas of patient evaluation and management remain discordant and controversial without universal agreement. Future research should move beyond expert opinion level V evidence towards high-quality appropriately designed and conducted investigations.
