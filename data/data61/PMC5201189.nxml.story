This study aimed at characterizing epidemiologic and clinical profiles of breast diseases in Niger during the period of 2010–2013 at the National Hospital of Niamey. Medical records were abstracted for demographic, reproductive, clinical, and treatment information. A process map of patient navigation and barriers to seeking medical care was developed after interviewing 26 local health professionals who encounter and/or manage breast diseases. We identified 245 breast cancers and 122 other breast diseases. Mean age of breast cancer patients was 45.4 (±13.26 years) and that of breast diseases was 31(±12.5 years) with 1/3 of cancers under age 44. Infection-related diseases represented 24% of non-cancers. Male breast diseases represented 4.75% of diseases and 2.05% of cancers. Only 37.1% of cancers had histopathologic confirmation and 90% of cancer patients presented at advanced stages and mastectomy was performed for 66% of breast cancers. Patient and system barriers to care were common in diagnosing and treating breast diseases. Women in Niger have double burden of infectious breast diseases and emerging breast cancer. Younger age and late diagnosis are common features. Reducing barriers to access to care, down-staging of cancer, implementation of clinical guidelines for managing advanced cases are important needs for reducing breast cancer morbidity and mortality in Niger.
