Early growth is an important indicator of health and wellbeing of children and a good predictor of adult health. The objective of this study was to examine trends and determinants of overweight and stunting among infants aged 0 to 23 month(s) over the past decade (1999-2011) in Uruguay. Data were used from four large representative samples of 11,056 infants aged 0-23 month(s), who attended public and private health services in 1999, 2003, 2007, and 2011, using a similar methodology. Linear regression analysis was used for assessing trends in early growth indices and binary logistic regression to estimate the probability of being stunted and overweight. Although prevalence of overweight fell from 12.5% (1999) to 9.5% (2011) and stunting from 13.6% to 10.9% respectively, both rates remained higher than expected. Low birthweight (LBW) was the main predictor of stunting [OR 6.5 (5.6-7.6)] and macrosomia of overweight [6.7 (5.3-8.3)]. We did not observe changes in LBW (7.8-8.8%) or macrosomia (5.9-6.7%) over the last decade. Boys showed increased chance of being overweight [OR 1.2 (1.04-1.3)]. Being stunted doubles the chances of being overweight [OR 2.5 (2.2-3.0)]. Overweight [OR 7.1 (6.1-8.3)], LBW [OR 13.2 (11.0-15.9)], and non-breastfed infants [OR 1.9 (1.7-2.1)] showed rapid weight gain. Uruguay has taken positive steps to decline the prevalence of stunting and overweight but both remain excessively high.
