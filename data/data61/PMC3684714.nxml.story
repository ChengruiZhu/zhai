). However, few studies have identified this effect with vitamin E-bonded polysulfone membranes, and no studies report the same effect on alpha (1) antitrypsin–LDL complex, a new oxidative lipid marker. This prompted us to examine the influence of use of VPS-HA vitamin E-bonded polysulfone high-flux membrane dialyzers on this new oxidative lipid marker. The subjects were 17 patients who had been dialyzed with VPS-HA for 12 months. The subjects’ baseline characteristics were as follows. Their average age was 65.6 ± 13.1 years, comprising 8 males and 9 females; hemodialysis vintage was 83.8 ± 85.4 months. Eight had chronic glomerular nephropathy and five had diabetic nephropathy. The primary outcome was defined as alpha (1) antitrypsin–LDL complex level after 12 months, as a post-study using VPS-HA. Secondary outcomes included triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels. The data were analyzed pre-study and after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months for alpha (1) antitrypsin–LDL complex, and pre-study and post-study for the other indicators. Twelve months after switching to VPS-HA, alpha (1) antitrypsin–LDL complex, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol had significantly decreased. Triglycerides and HDL cholesterol had not significantly changed. Hemodialysis therapy with VPS-HA was shown to decrease alpha (1) antitrypsin–LDL complex, an index of oxidative stress, and also to decrease some lipid markers.
