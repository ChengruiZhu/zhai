Skin wound healing is a complicated process that involves a variety of cells and cytokines. Fibroblasts play an important role in this process and participate in transformation into myofibroblasts, the synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM) and fibers, and the secretion of a variety of growth factors. This study assessed the effects of peptide Ser-Ile-Lys-Val-Ala-Val (SIKVAV)--modified chitosan hydrogels on skin wound healing. We investigated the capability of peptide SIKVAV to promote cell proliferation and migration, the synthesis of collagen, and the secretion of a variety of growth factors using fibroblasts in vitro. We also treated skin wounds established in mice using peptide SIKVAV-modified chitosan hydrogels. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed that peptide-modified chitosan hydrogels enhanced the reepithelialization of wounds compared with negative and positive controls. Massonâ€™s trichrome staining demonstrated that more collagen fibers were deposited in the wounds treated with peptide-modified chitosan hydrogels compared with the negative and positive controls. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the peptide-modified chitosan hydrogels promoted angiogenesis in the skin wound. Taken together, these results suggest that peptide SIKVAV-modified chitosan hydrogels may be useful in wound dressing and the treatment of skin wounds.
