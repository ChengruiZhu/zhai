A novel method to assess left ventricular (LV) mechanical dyssynchrony using three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE) and semi-automated border detection was investigated, which might be superior in prediction of response to cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) compared to traditional measures that rely solely on segmental time-to-contraction. Twenty-eight heart failure patients underwent real-time 3DE before CRT and at 6–12 months follow-up. Analysis of 3DE was performed using TomTec Research-Arena software featuring semi-automated endocardial border detection. The following echocardiographic parameters were calculated in a 16-segment model: areas under segmental time-volume-curves (STV); delay between contraction of the earliest and latest segment (L-E); and standard deviation of segmental time-to-contraction (SDI). Response to CRT was defined as ≥10% decrease in LV end-systolic volume at follow-up. Baseline Pre-STV had a higher sensitivity than SDI for prediction of response (94 vs 67%, respectively), with equal specificity (78%) and a higher area under receiver operator characteristic curve. In contrast, L-E had a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 56%. Using 3DE, methods that combine segmental time-to-contraction with segmental contractility might improve LV dyssynchrony assessment compared to traditional methods based on segmental time-to-contraction alone. Pre-STV might be a better predictor of response to CRT than SDI.
