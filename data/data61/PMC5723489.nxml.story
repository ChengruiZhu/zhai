Treatment of the internal mammary chain (IMC) with radiation therapy (RT) for patients with breast cancer remains a controversial issue. Different treatment techniques have been proposed, including oblique electrons, electron‐photon combination, and partially wide tangents (PWTs). However, the residual heart dose can remain significant mainly for left‐sided lesions. With PWTs and intensity‐modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), respiratory movement and errors in IMC localization remain a problem. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the impact of IMC brachytherapy (IMCBT) combined with 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) planning on heart, lung, and contralateral breast doses compared with IMRT. All plans including IMCBT plus 3DCRT were done on PLATO; IMRT plans were generated using the Cadplan‐Helios inverse treatment‐planning software module with the “sliding window&rdquo; technique. Dose‐volume histograms (DVHs) were calculated for all volumes of interest. Conformity and homogeneity index was also calculated for the planning target volume (PTV). Dose distribution in the surrounding normal tissue was evaluated. The mean conformity of the PTV was found to be 1.06 with IMCBT plus 3DCRT and 1.12 with IMRT. The mean homogeneity (HI95/107) was found to be 1.4 with IMCBT plus 3DCRT and 3.32 with IMRT. Using the IMCBT plus 3DCRT technique, the mean dose to the heart, contralateral breast, ipsilateral lung, and contralateral lung decreased with values of 32%, 6.76%, 20% and 5.52%, respectively, compared with IMRT. This novel technique of IMCBT plus 3DCRT can potentially reduce the dose to the heart and lungs. In addition, it rivals IMRT because of its unique advantages in localization, obviating the need for respiratory gating and maximum sparing of heart and other structures.
