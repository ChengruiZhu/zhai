Condyloma acuminata represents an epidermal manifestation, associated with the epidermotropic human papillomavirus (HPV). They have been reported as the most common sexually transmitted disease, with prevalence exceeding 50%, increased up to 4 times, within the last two decades, as the most common side of affection are the penis, vulva, vagina, cervix, perineum, and perianal area, with increased prevalence in young, sexually active individuals. Increased attention should be focused on lesions, caused by types, with moderate (33, 35, 39, 40, 43, 45, 51-56, 58) or high risk potential (types 16, 18) for malignant transformation, leading to further development of cancers of anus, vagina, vulva and penis, as well as cancers of the head and neck. A provident of coexistence of many of these types in the same patient could be seen in approximately 10-15% of patients, as the lack of adequate information on the oncogenic potential of many other types complicated the treatment and the further outcome. Although the variety of treatment options, genital condylomata acuminata still show high recurrent rate to destructive topical regiments, because of the activation of the viruses at some point, which emphasise the importance of virus- eradication, instead only of the topical destruction of the lesions. Despite decreasing the recurrent rate, the most important goal of immunisation is the reduction of the incidence of HPV-associated squamous cell carcinomas using either the quadrivalent (Silgard/Gardasil) or the bivalent (Cervarix) HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccine. We present a patient with periurethral condylomata acuminate, who refused performing of a biopsy for determining the virus type, as we want to emphasize the importance of the virus - treatment in all cases of genital warts, instead only of topical destruction of the lesions, not only because of the recurrence incidence rate, but also because of the well - known oncogenic potential of some HPV - types, as well as the unknown potential of various underestimated types, in contrast.
