Given the functional complexity of higher eukaryotes, the relatively small number of genes in the human and other mammalian genomes came as a surprise to the scientific community. Later it was discovered that the majority of genes are subject to alternative splicing (“cutting and pasting”) or associated mechanisms that ultimately increase the diversity of transcripts that code for proteins. Studies exploring transcript diversity are currently dominated by high-throughput experiments and computational methods; however, the quality of such data should be assessed against a reliable reference set based on single-gene studies. Unfortunately, the latter type of information is scattered throughout the scientific literature. The authors have thus developed a computational approach for extracting information on alternative transcripts from MEDLINE abstracts and used it to create a database, LSAT. LSAT (Literature Support for Alternative Transcripts) provides information for more than 4,000 genes from about 14,000 abstracts. This database can provide a quantitative understanding of the mechanisms behind tissue-specific gene expression based on single-gene studies, which we show agrees well with EST-based studies (these studies involve tissue-specific splicing detected by the analysis of libraries of expressed sequence tags [ESTs]). These results indicate that mechanisms like alternative splicing, alternative promoters, and alternative polyadenylation work in concert to generate and regulate transcript diversity. More generally, information extraction of complex biological process seems feasible and can also complement large-scale data generation in other areas to assign functions to genes.
