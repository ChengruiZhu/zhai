The majority of resuscitated patients present with underlying cardiac disease, and out of these myocardial infarction is most common. Immediate interventional treatment is recommended and routinely requires dual antiplatelet therapy including aspirin and a P2Y12-inhibitor. Therapeutic hypothermia or target temperature management is also recommended in these patients. Cardiogenic shock as well as reduced body temperature impacts platelet reactivity and its medical inhibition. The study aims to quantify aspirin- and P2Y12-mediated platelet inhibition in patients presenting with myocardial infarction and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Twenty-five resuscitated patients were enrolled in this prospective, observational, non-randomized single-centre study. These patients were compared to 77 matched controls from the ATLANTIS-ACS database of non-resuscitated patients with myocardial infarction. Platelet function testing was performed by light transmittance aggregometry. Aspirin reactivity was monitored by inducing platelet aggregation with collagen and arachidonic acid, respectively. P2Y12 inhibition was recorded by stimulation of platelet aggregation with adenosine diphosphate. To quantify the overall platelet response, thrombin receptor-activated peptide was used. Aspirin-mediated platelet reactivity decreased significantly in resuscitated patients during the first days and was significantly weaker on day 3 (collagen AUC 253.8 (122.7–352.2) vs. 109.0 (73.0–182.0);
