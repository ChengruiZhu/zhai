A total of 197 subject days, encompassing 141,840 data events were analyzed. Individual continuous patch use varied between 87-98%. On average, the cohort took 78% (SD 12) of prescribed medication and took 77% (SD 26) within the prescribed Â±2-hour time window. Average activity levels per subjects ranged from 4000-12,000 steps per day. The combination of activity level and heart rate indicated different levels of cardiovascular fitness between subjects. Visualizations over the entire study captured the longitudinal pattern of missed doses (the majority of which took place in the evening), the timing of ingestions in individual subjects, and the range of medication ingestion timing, which varied from 1.5-2.4 hours (Subject 3) to 11 hours (Subject 2). Individual morning self-management patterns over the study period were obtained by combining the times of waking, metformin ingestion, and glucose measurement. Visualizations combining multiple data streams over a 24-hour period captured patterns of broad daily events: when subjects rose in the morning, tested their blood glucose, took their medications, went to bed, hours of sleep/rest, and level of activity during the day. Visualizations identified highly consistent daily patterns in Subject 3, the most adherent participant. Erratic daily patterns including sleep/rest were demonstrated in Subject 2, the least adherent subject. Correlation between sleep /rest and medication ingestion in each individual subject was evaluated. Subjects 2 and 4 showed correlation between amount of sleep/rest over a 24-hour period and medication-taking the following day (Subject 2:
