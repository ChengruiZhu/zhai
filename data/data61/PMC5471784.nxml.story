Esophageal metastasis from colorectal carcinoma is uncommon, and diagnosis of esophageal metastasis is difficult. We report a case of a 54-year-old woman with postoperative recurrence of rectal cancer metastasizing to the esophagus. She underwent rectectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy with fluorouracil, leucovorin plus oxaliplatin for stage IIIB rectal cancer. Three years later, she presented with dysphagia and cough. Computed tomography showed thickening of the esophagus wall, enlargement of the lymph nodes in the mediastinum and abdomen, and ground-glass opacities in the right lung. Endoscopy revealed a submucosal tumor of the midthoracic esophagus. Histopathological analysis of the tumor biopsy showed infiltration of adenocarcinoma cells into the stroma of the esophagus; tumor cells were positive for caudal type homeobox 2 and negative for thyroid transcription factor 1. A transbronchial biopsy indicated pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis of rectal adenocarcinoma. Based on those findings, she was diagnosed with recurrent rectal cancer. She received fluorouracil-based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab, which ameliorated her symptoms and induced a durable response without severe adverse events. Diagnosis of esophageal metastasis from rectal cancer can thus be made by repeated biopsy. Furthermore, aggressive systemic treatment with fluorouracil-containing chemotherapy and bevacizumab is a treatment option for colorectal cancer patients with esophageal metastasis.
