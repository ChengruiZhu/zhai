Voltage-dependent ionic currents were recorded from squid giant fiber lobe neurons using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. When applied to the bathing solution, methadone was found to block IK, I Na and I Ca. Both I Na and I Ca were reduced without apparent change in kinetics and exhibited IC(50)'s of 50-100 and 250-500 mu M, respectively, at +10 mV. In contrast, IK was reduced in a time-dependent manner that is well fit by a simple model of open channel block (K(D)= 32+/- or 2 mu M, +60 mV, 10 degrees Celsius). The mechanism of I(K) block was examined in detail and involves a direct action of methadone, a tertiary amine, on K channels rather than an opioid receptor-mediated pathway. The kinetics of I(K) block resemble those reported for internally applied long chain quaternary ammonium (QA) compounds; and recovery from I(K) block is QA-like in its slow time course and strong dependence on holding potential. A quaternary derivative of methadone (N-methyl- methadone) only reproduced the effects of methadone on I(K) when included in the pipette solution; this compound was without effect when applied externally. I(K) block thus appears to involve diffusion of methadone into the cytoplasm and occlusion of the open K channel at the internal QA blocking site by the protonated form of the drug. This proposed mode of action is supported by the pH and voltage dependence of block as well as by the observation that high external K+ speeds the rate of drug dissociation. In addition, the effect of methadone on I(K) evoked during prolonged (300 ms) depolarizations suggests that methadone block may interfere with endogenous K+ channel inactivation. The effects of temperature, methadone stereoisomers, and the methadone- like drugs propoxyphene and nor-propoxyphene on IK block were examined. Methadone was also found to block I(K) in GH3 cells and in chick myoblasts.
