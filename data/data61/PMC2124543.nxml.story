.). If the instillations are separated two weeks or more anaphylaxis results. 5. We, therefore, hold that if tuberculin (0.1 cubic centimeter) is carefully instilled into the conjunctival sac and if careful comparison of the instilled eye with the opposite eye shows that a reaction of varying intensity results in from ten to twelve hours after the first instillation, a tubercular lesion is present. 6. In our first report (7) we were inclined to believe that subcutaneous tubercular injection given previous to the ocular test would slightly inhibit it. We have since become convinced that this is true only to a limited extent, and that in some cases the ophthalmo-reaction is exaggerated by a subcutaneous injection of tuberculin. 7. The primary ophthalmo-tuberculin reaction is in direct proportion to the extent of the tubercular processes in the body. The more extensive the tubercular processes, the more anaphylactic the animal is. This is in direct variance with the condition in the usual subcutaneous tuberculin test. (See Necropsy Report.) 8. We are inclined to believe that the ophthalmo-tuberculin test will reveal tuberculosis at as early a state as the usual subcutaneous test. 9. The ophthalmo-reaction is of no value in determining whether vaccinated cattle are actively tubercular or not, or in demonstrating any hypersusceptibility in the offspring of tubercular cattle. 10. The cutaneous test from our brief series of experiments does not seem to be as accurate as the ophthalmic test. This conclusion has been reached by several investigators.
