Effects of previous activity on the ability of frog skeletal muscle at 0 degrees C to liberate energy associated with contractile activation, i.e., activation heat (AH), have been examined. Earlier work suggests that activation heat amplitude (as measured from muscles stretched to lengths where active force development is nearly abolished) is related to the amount of Ca2+ released upon stimulation. After a twitch, greater than 2 s is required before a second stimulus (AHt) can liberate the same activation heat as a first stimulus (AH infinity), i.e., (AHt)/(AH infinity) = 1 -0.83 e-1.40t, where t is time in seconds. Caffeine introduces a time delay in the recovery of the ability to generate activation heat after a twitch. After a tetanus, the activation heat is depressed to a greater extent at any time than after a twitch. The activation heat elicited by a stimulus 1 s after a tetanus is depressed progressively with respect to tetanus duration up to 3 s. For tetani of 3, 40, and 80 s duration the postetanus activation heat is comparably depressed. The time-course of the recovery of the ability of the muscle to produce activation heat after a tetanus can be described as (AHt)/(AH infinity) = 1 -0.80 e-0.95t - 0.20 e-0.02t. Greater than 90 s is required before the posttetanus activation heat is equal to the pretetanus value. The faster phase of recovery is similar to recovery after the twitch and the slower phase may be associated with the return of calcium to the terminal cisternae from uptake sites in the longitudinal sarcoplasmic reticulum.
