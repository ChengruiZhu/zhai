Coronary artery disease (CAD) has been reported to be a major cause of death worldwide. Current treatment methods include atherectomy, coronary angioplasty (as a percutaneous coronary intervention), and coronary artery bypass. Among them, the insertion of stents into the coronary artery is one of the commonly used methods for CAD, although the formation of in-stent restenosis (ISR) is a major drawback, demanding improvement in stent technology. Stents can be improved using the delivery of DNA, siRNA, and miRNA rather than anti-inflammatory/anti-thrombotic drugs. In particular, genes that could interfere with the development of plaque around infected regions are conjugated on the stent surface to inhibit neointimal formation. Despite their potential benefits, it is necessary to explore the various properties of gene-eluting stents. Furthermore, multifunctional electronic stents that can be used as a biosensor and deliver drug- or gene-based on physiological condition will be a very promising way to the successful treatment of ISR. In this review, we have discussed the molecular mechanism of restenosis, the use of drug- and gene-eluting stents, and the possible roles that these stents have in the prevention and treatment of coronary restenosis. Further, we have explained how multifunctional electronic stents could be used as a biosensor and deliver drugs based on physiological conditions.
