Low-grade myofibroblastic sarcoma (LGMS) is a neoplasm of the soft tissue characterized by myofibroblastic differentiation. This type of tumor has been observed in various sites in the whole body, but frequently occurs in the head and neck region. It typically presents as a slow-growing painless mass, which is often mistaken for a benign lesion due to its indolent growth; however, LGMS is a malignant neoplasm. In the present study, a 43-year-old female presented with a 14-mm LGMS lesion in the buccal subcutaneous tissues of the buccinator muscle. The patient had initially noticed the lesion 2-months prior to presenting at the hospital. Following biopsy, the tumor was surgically resected and no recurrence or metastasis was observed during a follow-up time of 2 years. To the best of our knowledge, this case is the first report of LGMS located in the buccal subcutaneous tissue of the buccinator muscle. The present study a literature review of 55 cases of this tumor type in the head and neck region was conducted, revealing that the indolent growth of these lesions may contribute to a delay in diagnosis. The average time between the onset of clinical symptoms and hospital admission is 3.9 months, and this form of tumor is frequently misdiagnosed as a benign lesion. Therefore, the present study suggests that an incisional biopsy may be performed to rule out LGMS when clinicians encounter patients with the aforementioned indolent lesions anywhere in the body. In addition, the avoidance of radiotherapy is recommended following resection of the LGMS tumor, as it may induce LGMS recurrence.
