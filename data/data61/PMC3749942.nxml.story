Natural populations typically harbor much genetic variation. Some of this variation is cryptic — it does not affect observed traits except if the organism is exposed to a major environmental or genetic perturbation. One often-proposed explanation for the revelation of cryptic genetic variation is that the perturbation has made the organisms less robust to mutations, thereby revealing effects of previously neutral mutations that natural selection had allowed to accumulate. Such effects would be dependent on genetic background, as particular cryptic variants will be present in some individuals and not others. We show that a perturbation of chromatin architecture caused by mutation of the budding-yeast gene HTZ1, encoding histone H2A.Z, does alter phenotypes in a genetic background-dependent manner but does not reduce mutational robustness. Using a large set of yeast lines that accumulated mutations with minimal natural selection, we compared variation in cell morphology with and without HTZ1. The effect of eliminating HTZ1 was highly line dependent, suggesting that HTZ1 interacts extensively with genetic variation in the lines. However, HTZ1+ lines span a range of phenotypes similar to that of the corresponding HTZ1− lines. Our results therefore call into question prior studies linking revelation of cryptic genetic variation with reduced mutational robustness.
