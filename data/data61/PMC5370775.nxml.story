This study was planned as a randomized controlled pilot study. A total of 27 patients (mean age=38.9Â±10.8 years, range=20-60 years; 16 females) with PFPS were assessed and randomly assigned into 2 groups. Group I received a standard program (quadriceps strengthening, hip strengthening and hamstring stretching) and NMES combined with quadriceps strengthening exercises simultaneously. Group II received the same standard program without NMES. Both groups were enrolled 3 times per week for 40 minutes per day in 6 weeks. Patients were assessed at the baseline, 3 rd, 6th, and 12th weeks of treatment. Quadriceps strength was evaluated by isokinetic dynamometer. The range of motion at testing was set between 0 for extension to 90 for flexion. The test was performed at 60 degrees/sn and concentric maximum peak torque value was recorded. Kujala and Lysholm scores were used for functional assessments. The data were analyzed using the SPSS 20.0. Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess the distribution of data. The changes in dependent variables before treatment, 3 rd, 6th, and 12th weeks were analyzed using a 2 by 4 mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA). Pairwise comparisons with paired t test were used to determine whether the Group I or Group II, has changed over time. An intention- to- treat analysis was performed to impute values for missing data. An alpha level of 0.05 was established.
