We report a double-click
macrocyclization approach for the design
of constrained peptide inhibitors having non-helical or extended conformations.
Our targets are the tankyrase proteins (TNKS), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases
(PARP) that regulate Wnt signaling by targeting Axin for degradation.
TNKS are deregulated in many different cancer types, and inhibition
of TNKS therefore represents an attractive therapeutic strategy. However,
clinical development of TNKS-specific PARP catalytic inhibitors is
challenging due to off-target effects and cellular toxicity. We instead
targeted the substrate-recognition domain of TNKS, as it is unique
among PARP family members. We employed a two-component strategy, allowing
peptide and linker to be separately engineered and then assembled
in a combinatorial fashion via click chemistry. Using the consensus
substrate-peptide sequence as a starting point, we optimized the length
and rigidity of the linker and its position along the peptide. Optimization
was further guided by high-resolution crystal structures of two of
the macrocyclized peptides in complex with TNKS. This approach led
to macrocyclized peptides with submicromolar affinities for TNKS and
high proteolytic stability that are able to disrupt the interaction
between TNKS and Axin substrate and to inhibit Wnt signaling in a
dose-dependent manner. The peptides therefore represent a promising
starting point for a new class of substrate-competitive inhibitors
of TNKS with potential for suppressing Wnt signaling in cancer. Moreover,
by demonstrating the application of the double-click macrocyclization
approach to non-helical, extended, or irregularly structured peptides,
we greatly extend its potential and scope, especially given the frequency
with which such motifs mediate proteinâ€“protein interactions.
