 1. Experiments were carried out to decide whether or not the electromotive properties of dried collodion membranes depend upon their thickness. 2. A number of dried collodion membranes of varying thickness, 3–160 µ, were prepared from collodion preparations of different electrochemical activity. The characteristic concentration potentials across them were measured and the means of these values determined for each thickness. 3. The characteristic concentration potentials across dried collodion membranes are a function of their thickness. The thinnest membranes yield in all cases the lowest concentration potentials; increasingly thicker membranes give increasingly higher potential values, until a constant value is reached which is characteristic of the particular collodion preparation used. With electrochemically active collodion, characteristic concentration potentials approaching the thermodynamically possible maximum are obtained with membranes of only 10 µ thickness, thinner membranes giving appreciably lower values. With two rather inactive commercial collodion preparations the characteristic concentration potential increases from about 30 mv. for membranes 3 µ thick to about 42 mv. for 20 µ membranes; still thicker membranes do not show a significant increase in the potential values. With a highly purified collodion preparation the constant maximum value was found to be about 32 mv., 4 µ thick membranes giving only about 22 mv. 4. These results do not support the homogeneous phase theory as applied to the dried collodion membrane. They are readily compatible with the micellar-structural theory. Several special possible cases of the latter as applied to the dried collodion membrane are discussed.
