Chloroplasts are subcellular organelles in plants and algae that carry out the core reactions of photosynthesis. Chloroplasts originated as cyanobacterial endosymbionts. Subsequent coevolution with their eukaryotic host resulted in a massive transfer of genes to the nuclear genome, the acquisition of new gene expression mechanisms, and the integration of chloroplast functions into host programs. Chloroplasts in multicellular plants develop from non-photosynthetic proplastids, a process that involves a prodigious increase in the expression of chloroplast genes encoding components of the photosynthetic apparatus. We used RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling to generate a comprehensive description of the dynamics of chloroplast gene expression during the transformation of proplastids into the distinct chloroplast types found in bundle sheath and mesophyll cells in maize. Genes encoding proteins that make up the chloroplast gene expression machinery peak in protein output earlier in development than do those encoding proteins that function in photosynthesis. Programmed changes in translational efficiencies superimpose on changes in mRNA abundance to shift the balance of protein output as chloroplast development proceeds. We also mined the data to gain insight into general features of chloroplast gene expression, such as relative translational efficiencies, the impact of RNA editing on translation, and the identification of rate limiting steps in gene expression. The findings clarify the parameters that dictate the abundance of chloroplast gene products and revealed unanticipated phenomena to be addressed in future studies.
