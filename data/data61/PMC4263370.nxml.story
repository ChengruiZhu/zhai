In this article we present SteatoNet, the most comprehensive computational network of hepatic metabolism and the interaction of the liver with extra-hepatic tissues. Generation of the SteatoNet involved the application of engineering strategies to resolve prevalent drawbacks in biological modelling and thus effectively understand basic biology. SteatoNet does not require detailed kinetic parameters, behaves representatively of biological observations and portrays systemic interactions. SteatoNet is simple and flexible, which is an important advantage over current computational models of complex metabolic disorders associated with the liver. To demonstrate the utility of SteatoNet as a hypotheses-generation tool, we studied candidate mechanisms of hepatic fat accumulation, the key characteristic of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a common but poorly understood metabolic disorder influenced by genetic and lifestyle factors. Our data describe NAFLD as a network disease, with deregulated pathways such as inter-tissue transport of glucose, lipid and ketone bodies, cholesterol metabolism and “stiff” focal points in the fat tissue. These results indicate the involvement of systemic metabolic deregulations in the transformation of healthy to fatty liver in NAFLD. The SteatoNet highlights the utility of engineering approaches in systems biology to aid in solving complex biological questions.
