In the previous study, lymphocyte surface molecules were separated into two subsets depending on whether capping was associated was associated with redistribution of cytoplasmic myosin. In the present study, the effects of the local anesthetic chlorpromazine and of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 were compared. Both drugs affected the surface redistribution of immunoglobulin (Ig), Fc receptors, and the TL antigen- -molecules that appear to cap by association with microfilaments--but had no effect on the Thy.1 (theta) and H2 antigens--molecules that cap slowly, apparently unlinked to microfilament function. The capping of Ig, Fc receptor, and TL was inhibited while that of H2 and theta was not. Both drugs reversed the Ig Fc receptor, and TL caps but not the H2 and theta caps. In the former group, the reversal of caps was accompanied by a parallel reversal of the myosin segregated to the cap area. The appearance of myosin after drug treatment varied: chlorpromazine resulted in a diffuse pattern similar to that of normal lymphocytes, whereas A23187 produced an array of aggregates and coarse filaments. The results are compatible with the view that two mechanisms for capping exist in the lymphocyte. The Ca2+ ionophore may affect capping of microfilament-dependent caps by producing a systemic activation of contractile proteins while chlorpromazine may act by disrupting a Ca2+-dependent link between surface complexes and the contractile proteins.
