T-lymphocytes are central regulators of the adaptive immune response, and their inappropriate activation can cause autoimmune diseases or cancer. The understanding of the signaling mechanisms underlying T cell activation is a prerequisite to develop new strategies for pharmacological intervention and disease treatments. However, much of the existing literature on T cell signaling is related to T cell development or to activation processes in transformed T cell lines (e.g., Jurkat), whereas information on non-transformed primary T cells is limited. Here, immunologists and theoreticians have compiled data from the existing literature that stem from analysis of primary T cells. They used this information to establish a qualitative Boolean network that describes T cell activation mechanisms after engagement of the TCR, the CD4/CD8 co-receptors, and CD28. The network comprises 94 nodes and can be extended to facilitate interpretation of new data that emerge from experimental analysis of T cell activation. Newly developed tools and methods allow in silico analysis, and manipulation of the network and can uncover hidden/unforeseen signaling pathways. Indeed, by assessing signaling events controlled by CD28 and the protein tyrosine kinase Fyn, we show that computational analysis of even a qualitative network can provide new and non-obvious signaling pathways which can be validated experimentally.
