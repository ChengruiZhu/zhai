Long interspersed element-1 (L1) sequences comprise about 17% of the human genome reference sequence. The average human genome contains about 100 active L1s that mobilize throughout the genome by a “copy and paste” process termed retrotransposition. Active L1s encode two proteins (ORF1p and ORF2p). ORF1p and ORF2p preferentially bind to their encoding RNA, forming a ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP). During retrotransposition, the L1 RNP translocates to the nucleus, where the ORF2p endonuclease makes a single-strand nick in target site DNA that exposes a 3′ hydroxyl group in genomic DNA. The 3′ hydroxyl group then is used as a primer by the ORF2p reverse transcriptase to copy the L1 RNA into cDNA, leading to the integration of an L1 copy at a new genomic location. The evolutionary success of L1 requires the faithful retrotransposition of full-length L1 mRNAs; thus, it was surprising to find that a small number of L1 retrotransposition events are derived from spliced L1 mRNAs. By using genetic, biochemical, and computational approaches, we demonstrate that spliced L1 mRNAs can undergo an initial round of retrotransposition, leading to the generation of spliced integrated retrotransposed elements (SpIREs). SpIREs represent about 2% of previously annotated full-length primate-specific L1s in the human genome reference sequence. However, because splicing leads to intra-L1 deletions that remove critical sequences required for L1 expression, SpIREs generally cannot undergo subsequent rounds of retrotransposition and can be considered “dead on arrival” insertions. Our data further highlight how genetic conflict between L1 and its host has influenced L1 expression, L1 retrotransposition, and L1 splicing dynamics over evolutionary time.
