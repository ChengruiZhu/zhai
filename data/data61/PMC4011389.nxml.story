To provide insight and to identify the occurrence of mechanistic changes in relation to variance in solvent-type, the solvent effects on the rates of solvolysis of three substrates, 2,2,2-trichloro-1,1-dimethylethyl chloroformate, 2,2,2-trichloroethyl chloroformate, and 1-chloroethyl chloroformate, are analyzed using linear free energy relationships (LFERs) such as the extended Grunwald-Winstein equation, and a similarity-based LFER model approach that is based on the solvolysis of phenyl chloroformate. At 25.0 °C, in four common solvents, the α-chloroethyl chloroformate was found to react considerably faster than the two β,β,β-trichloro-substituted analogs. This immense rate enhancement can be directly related to the proximity of the electron-withdrawing α-chlorine atom to the carbonyl carbon reaction center. In the thirteen solvents studied, 1-chloroethyl chloroformate was found to strictly follow a carbonyl addition process, with the addition-step being rate-determining. For the two β,β,β-trichloro-substrates, in aqueous mixtures that are very rich in a fluoroalcohol component, there is compelling evidence for the occurrence of side-by-side addition-elimination and ionization mechanisms, with the ionization pathway being predominant. The presence of the two methyl groups on the α-carbon of 2,2,2-trichloro-1,1-dimethylethyl chloroformate has additive steric and stereoelectronic implications, causing its rate of reaction to be significantly slower than that of 2,2,2-trichloroethyl chloroformate.
