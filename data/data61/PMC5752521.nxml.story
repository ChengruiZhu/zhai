Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the major subtype of lung cancer, which is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality in the world. It is a complex disease involving multiple genetic alterations. As a cytokine belonging to the Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF- α) family, the - a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) expression and its signaling have been studied in many human solid tumor types, but the data on APRIL signaling in NSCLC are lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate the APRIL expression and investigate its signaling in NSCLC. The expression of APRIL and its receptors, B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and transmembrane activator and calcium-modulatorand cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI), was analyzed by using immunohistochemistry in NSCLC samples. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to evaluate mRNA expression of APRIL, BCMA and TACI in human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines A549, H1299, and H1650. Cell proliferation was measured by using the cell proliferation and cytotoxicity assay kit 8 (CCK8) assay, cell migration by using wound healing assay, and cell invasion by using transwall assay. The protein level of APRIL, BCMA and TAC, and the activation of extracellular regulated protein kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling, were determined by western blot. Our results indicated, APRIL and its receptors BCMA and TACI, were overexpressed in most of human NSCLC samples and cell lines; APRIL promoted tumor proliferation, migration and metastasis in A549 and H1299 cells via BCMA and TACI. Furthermore, ERK1/2 activation was involved in APRIL signaling through TACI but not BCMA in A549 and H1299 cells. APRIL might serve as a potential prognostic biomarker for NSCLC, and APRIL related signaling pathway could be a therapeutic target for NSCLC.
