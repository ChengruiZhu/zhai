The peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor PPARγ plays an essential role in vascular biology, modulating macrophage function and atherosclerosis progression. Recently, we have described the beneficial effect of combined activation of the ghrelin/GHS-R1a receptor and the scavenger receptor CD36 to induce macrophage cholesterol release through transcriptional activation of PPARγ. Although the interplay between CD36 and PPARγ in atherogenesis is well recognized, the contribution of the ghrelin receptor to regulate PPARγ remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that ghrelin triggers PPARγ activation through a concerted signaling cascade involving Erk1/2 and Akt kinases, resulting in enhanced expression of downstream effectors LXRα and ABC sterol transporters in human macrophages. These effects were associated with enhanced PPARγ phosphorylation independently of the inhibitory conserved serine-84. Src tyrosine kinase Fyn was identified as being recruited to GHS-R1a in response to ghrelin, but failure of activated Fyn to enhance PPARγ Ser-84 specific phosphorylation relied on the concomitant recruitment of docking protein Dok-1, which prevented optimal activation of the Erk1/2 pathway. Also, substitution of Ser-84 preserved the ghrelin-induced PPARγ activity and responsiveness to Src inhibition, supporting a mechanism independent of Ser-84 in PPARγ response to ghrelin. Consistent with this, we found that ghrelin promoted the PI3-K/Akt pathway in a Gα
