As natural environments change, animals need to continuously learn and update predictions about their current context to optimize behaviour. According to predictive coding, a general principle of brain function is the propagation of both neural predictions from hierarchically higher to lower brain regions and of the ensuing prediction-errors back up the cortical hierarchy. We show that the neural activity that signals internal predictions and prediction-errors depends on the current task or goals. We applied magnetoencephalography and computational modelling of behavioural data to a study in which human participants could generate spatial and temporal predictions about upcoming stimuli, while performing spatial or temporal tasks. We found that current context (task relevance) modulated the influence of predictions on behavioural and neural responses. At the level of behavioural responses, only the task-relevant predictions led to improvement in task performance. At the level of neural responses, we found that predictions and prediction-errors correlated with activity in different brain regions and in dissociable frequency bandsâ€”reflecting synchronized neural activity. Crucially, these specific neural signatures of prediction and prediction-error signalling were strongly modulated by their contextual relevance. Thus, our results show that current goals influence prediction and prediction-error signalling in the brain.
