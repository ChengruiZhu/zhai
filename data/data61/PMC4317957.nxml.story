The aim of the current study is to evaluate the prognostic value of anemia, an easily estimable parameter in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (R-CHOP) immunochemotherapy. A total of 157 patients with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with ≥1 cycle of R-CHOP were included. Hemoglobin level without red cell transfusion within 7 days of initiation of treatment was chosen as a parameter of baseline cancer-induced anemia. To investigate the clinical significance of chemotherapy-induced anemia and its recovery after completion of treatment, 87 patients in complete remission for ≥6 months from the time of the last cycle of R-CHOP were grouped and analyzed separately. Patients with a cancer-induced anemia of hemoglobin <10 g/dL showed inferior event-free and disease-free survival compared to those with hemoglobin ≥10 g/dL. This finding was observed irrespective of the status of pre-treatment bone marrow involvement. In multivariate analysis, hemoglobin <10 g/dL was found to be an international prognostic index-independent prognostic factor. Risk of relapse was significantly higher for patients who were still anemic at 6 months after R-CHOP, compared to those who achieved complete recovery from chemotherapy-induced anemia within 6 months.
