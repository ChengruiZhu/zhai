The researchers stained slices of LCH granulomas with antibodies (proteins made by the immune system) that label different types of cell and with an antibody that recognizes Ki-67, a protein made by proliferating cells. On average, only 6% of the proliferating cells in the granulomas were Langerhans cells. 12% were T lymphocytes (immune system cells that directly kill bacteria and viruses and stimulate antibody production by B lymphocytes). The rest were endothelial cells (which line blood vessels) and fibroblasts (which form the framework that supports the tissues of the body). These data suggest that abnormal proliferation of Langerhans cells is not responsible for maintenance and spread of granulomasâ€”so could increased survival of these cells lead to their accumulation in granulomas instead? When the researchers investigated the immunological characteristics of LCH granulomas, they found that many of the T cells in the granulomas were regulatory T cells (T-regs), a type of T cell that inhibits T cell responses and prevents the body from attacking itself. Consistent with the presence of T-regs, IL10 (a protein made by T cells that suppresses the function of Langerhans cells) was abundant within the granulomas. Furthermore, the Langerhans cells in the granulomas expressed RANK, a protein that stimulates the proliferation of T-regs, and patients with LCH had a higher proportion of T-regs in their blood than did healthy children; this proportion decreased during their treatment for LCH. Finally, all the children with LCH that the researchers tested had an impaired delayed-type hypersensitivity response, an indication that the increased numbers of T-regs had inhibited their immune system.
