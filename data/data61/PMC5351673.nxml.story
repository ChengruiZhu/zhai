Although a few studies have assessed the prognostic value of long noncoding RNA HOTTIP in patients with malignant tumors, the relationship between HOTTIP and clinical outcome of breast cancer remains elusive. The aim of this study is to explore the prognostic significance of HOTTIP in breast cancer patients. A meta-analysis was performed to involve the eligible studies to investigate the association of HOTTIP expression level with outcome in cancer patients. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of HOTTIP for cancer survival were calculated. Five relevant articles involving 460 patients with various solid carcinomas were included in this meta-analysis. For overall survival, high HOTTIP expression could significantly predict worse outcome with the pooled HR of 2.29 (95 % CI 1.72â€“3.03, P < 0.00001). Furthermore, Gene Expression Omnibus was performed to evaluate the association of HOTTIP expression with the prognosis in breast cancer patients. It was also found an indication that high HOTTIP expression was associated with worse survival in breast cancer patients by microarray analysis (GSE20711, GSE16446 and GSE9195). Finally, association between HOTTIP levels and clinicopathological factors and prognosis was also analyzed in an independent validation cohort including 100 breast cancer cases. HOTTIP expression was correlated with tumor size (P=0.025), lymph node status (P=0.009) and TNM stage (P=0.0001) in the breast cancer validation cohort. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated that breast cancer patients with high HOTTIP expression had worse overall survival (P=0.0139) and disease-free survival (P=0.0003). Multivariate survival analysis based on the Cox proportional hazards model showed that HOTTP is considered as an independent prognostic factor in breast cancer patients. Together, our combined results suggest that high HOTTIP expression may be serving as an unfavorable prognosis predictor for breast cancer patients.
