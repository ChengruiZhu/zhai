Benign tumours account for approximately 60-80% of parotid neoplasms and among these, Warthin's tumour is the second most common benign neoplasm accounting for approximately 15% of all parotid epithelial tumours. The medical records of 100 consecutive patients with Warthin's tumour of the parotid gland admitted for treatment at the Department of Head and Neck Surgery and Otorhinolaryngology, Hospital A.C. Camargo, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, between 1983 and 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. The surgical procedures included 104 (96%) subtotal parotidectomies and 4 (3.7%) total parotidectomies. One hundred and eight parotidectomies were performed in 100 patients with Warthin's tumour. Postoperative complications occurred in 67 (62.3%) of surgical procedures, and facial nerve dysfunction was the most frequent complication, occurring in 51 of 108 surgeries (47.2%). The marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve was affected in 46 of the 48 cases (95.8%) of facial nerve dysfunction. Frey's syndrome was diagnosed in the late postoperative period in 19 patients (17.6%). We conclude that either superficial or total parotidectomy with preservation of facial nerve are the treatment of choice for Warthin's tumour with no case of recurrence seen after long-term follow-up. Facial nerve dysfunction and Frey's syndrome were the main complications associated with this surgery. Thus, if on one hand total parotidectomy is an appropriate radical resection of parotid parenchyma reducing, in theory, the risk of recurrence, on the other hand superficial parotidectomy is also a radical and efficient method with lower morbidity in terms of facial nerve dysfunction and Frey's syndrome.
