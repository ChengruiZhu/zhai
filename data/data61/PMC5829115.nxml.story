Cell based tissue engineering serves as a promising strategy for articular cartilage repair, which remains a challenge both for researchers and clinicians. The aim of this research was to assess the potential of autologous nasal chondrocytes (NCs) combined with alginate hydrogel as injectable constructs for rabbit articular cartilage repair. Autologous nasal chondrocytes were isolated from rabbit nasal septum, expanded either on monolayer or in 3D alginate hydrogel. In vitro, DNA quantification revealed that NCs can proliferate stable in 3D alginate matrix, but slower than that cultured in monolayer. Further, a higher synthesis rate of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) was detected by GAG measurement in 3D alginate culture. Gene expression analysis at different time point (day 1, 7, 14) showed that 3D culture of NCs in alginate up-regulated chondrogenic markers (Col2A1, ACAN SOX9), meanwhile down-regulated dedifferentiation related gene (Col1A1). In vivo, autologous nasal chondrocytes combined with alginate hydrogel were used for repairing rabbit knee osteochondral defect (Alg + NC group). Histological staining indicated that Alg + NC group obtained superior and more hyaline-like repaired tissue both at 3 and 6 months after surgery. Mechanical analysis showed that the repaired tissue in the Alg + NC group possessed similar mechanical properties to the native cartilage. In conclusion, nasal chondrocytes appeared to be a very promising seed cell source for cartilage tissue engineering, and alginate hydrogel can serve as suitable delivery system.
