In every cell, ribosomes translate the genetic instructions carried by messenger RNAs into the proteins they encode. Molecular midwives called chaperones often bind to nascent protein chains as they emerge from the ribosome to help them fold. Very little is known about this process. Do all proteins need chaperone assistance as they exit the ribosome? Do different chaperones recognize different polypeptide chains and, if so, how? Answering these questions has been hard because most studies have examined only a handful of model proteins and their interactions with a specific chaperone. Here, we used a systematic approach to investigate the challenging question of chaperone specificity in living cells. We isolated specific chaperones that interact with nascent proteins during translation along with the ribosomes and associated mRNAs encoding the emerging proteins. We then used DNA microarrays to identify the full suite of mRNAs and thus the encoded proteins that interact cotranslationally with each of these factors. We learned from these studies that individual chaperones interact with a specific set of nascent proteins. Furthermore, overlapping specificity enables one chaperone to modulate the specificity and fidelity of another. The picture that emerges suggests that these molecular midwives are an important part of the intricate systems that maintain specificity, precision, and efficiency in expressing the genome's instructions.
