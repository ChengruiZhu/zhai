Vascular calcification (VC) is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We recently reported that apocynin had benefits for preventing cardiovascular diseases. However, whether apocynin could attenuate VC is unknown. Here, we investigated the role of apocynin in VC and its underlying mechanisms. 163 participants with high or normal ankleâ€“brachial index (ABI) were enrolled in this study for analyzing the demographic and biochemical data. In vitro, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were exposed to calcification medium containing b-glycerophosphate and angiotensin II (Ang II) for 24 hours. The results showed that serum level of Ang II was significantly increased in patients with high ABI (P<0.05). In cultured VSMCs, Ang II significantly exacerbated osteogenic switching. The expression of osteogenic phenotype markers, including bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and osteopontin (OPN), were significantly upregulated, whereas contractile markers expression, including alpha smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) and smooth muscle 22 alpha (SM22a) were simultaneously downregulated. However, these effects were greatly attenuated by apocynin. Apocynin enhanced expression of a-SMA by 5.3%, and reduced expression of BMP2, Runx2, OPN by 3.37%, 0.61% and 3.07%, respectively. Furthermore, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation was upregulated by Ang II, and this effect was also reversed by apocynin. Intriguingly, pretreatment with U0126, an inhibitor of ERK1/2, had similar effects with apocynin. Apocynin may act as a novel molecular candidate to protect against VSMCs osteogenic switching through suppressing ERK1/2 pathway.
