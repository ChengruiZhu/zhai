. where to eat) we first have to identify a set of environmental features that are relevant for the decision (e.g. the distance to the place, current time or the price). Although we are able to make such inferences almost effortlessly, this type of problems is computationally challenging, as we live in a complex environment that constantly changes and contains an immense number of features. Here we investigated the question of how the human brain solves this computational challenge. In particular, we designed a new experimental paradigm and derived novel behavioral models to test the hypothesis that attention modulates the formation of beliefs about the relevance of several environmental features. As each behavioral model accounted for a different hypothesis about the underlying computational mechanism we compared them in their ability to explain the measured behavior of human subjects performing the experimental task. The model comparison indicates that an attentional-focus mechanism is a key feature of behavioral models that accurately replicate subjectsâ€™ behavior. These findings suggest that the evolution of beliefs is modulated by a competitive attractor dynamics that forms prior expectation about future outcomes. Hence, the findings provide interesting and novel insights into the computational mechanisms underlying human behavior when making decisions in complex environments.
