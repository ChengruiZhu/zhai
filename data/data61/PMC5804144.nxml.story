. In Experiment 1, a live face-to-face real-time interaction between 2 courting pigeons (Live) was compared to a played back version of the video stimulus recorded during the pairs Live interaction. We found that pigeons were behaving interactively; their behavior depended on the relationships between their own signals and those of their partner. In Experiment 2, we tested whether social interactivity relies on spatial cues present in the facing direction of a partner’s display. By moving the teleprompter camera 90° away from its original location, the partner’s display was manipulated to appear as if it is directed 90° away from the subject. We found no effect of spatial offset on the pigeon’s behavioral response. In Experiment 3, 3 time delays, 1 s, 3 s, and 9 s, a Live condition, and a playback condition were chosen to investigate the importance of temporal contiguity in social interactivity. Furthermore, both opposite-sex (courtship) and same-sex (rivalry) pairs were studied to investigate whether social-context affects social interactivity sensitivity. Our results showed that pigeon courtship behavior is sensitive to temporal contiguity. Behavior declined in the 9 s and Playback conditions as compared to Live condition and the shorter time delays. For males only, courtship behavior also increased in the 3-s delay condition. The effect of social interactivity and time delay was not observed in rivalry interactions, suggesting that social interactivity may be specific to courtship.
