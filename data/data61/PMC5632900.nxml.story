Proper physiological function of the ovaries is very important for the entire female reproductive system and overall health. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated as by-products during ovarian physiological metabolism, and antioxidants are indicated as factors that can maintain the balance between ROS production and clearance. A disturbance in this balance can induce pathological consequences in oocyte maturation, ovulation, fertilization, implantation, and embryo development, which can ultimately influence pregnancy outcomes. However, our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these physiological and pathological processes is lacking. This article presents up-to-date findings regarding the effects of antioxidants on the ovaries. An abundance of evidence has confirmed the various significant roles of these antioxidants in the ovaries. Some animal models are discussed in this review to demonstrate the harmful consequences that result from mutation or depletion of antioxidant genes or genes related to antioxidant synthesis. Disruption of antioxidant systems may lead to pathological consequences in women. Antioxidant supplementation is indicated as a possible strategy for treating reproductive disease and infertility by controlling oxidative stress (OS). To confirm this, further investigations are required and more antioxidant therapy in humans has to been performed.
