Invasion, metastasis and chemoresistance are leading causes of death in breast cancer patients. A vital change of epithelial cells, epithelialâ€“mesenchymal transition (EMT), is involved in these processes. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms controlling EMT remain to be elucidated. Our previous studies have shown that ectopic N3ICD expression inhibits EMT in MDA-MB-231, a triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) epithelial cell line. To decipher the mechanism, we performed in-depth studies. Specifically, we found that overexpressing N3ICD transcriptionally upregulated the expression of Kibra, an upstream member of the Hippo pathway. Correspondingly, we also observed that phosphorylated Hippo pathway core kinases, including Lats1/2 and MST1/2, were increased and decreased by overexpressing and knocking down Notch3, respectively. Furthermore, we found that the oncogenic transcriptional coactivator yes-associated protein (YAP), which is negatively regulated by the Hippo pathway, was inhibited by overexpressing N3ICD in breast cancer epithelial cells. The ability of Kibra to inhibit EMT has been previously reported. We thus speculated that Notch3 inhibition of EMT is mediated by upregulated Kibra. To verify this hypothesis, a rescue experiment was performed. Evidently, the ability of Notch3 to inhibit EMT can be countered by knocking down Kibra expression. These data suggest that Notch3 inhibits EMT by activating the Hippo/YAP pathway by upregulating Kibra in breast cancer epithelial cells, and Kibra may be a downstream effector of Notch3. These findings deepen our understanding of EMT in both development and disease, and will undoubtedly help to provide new therapeutic strategies for interfering with cancer invasion and metastasis, especially for TNBC.
