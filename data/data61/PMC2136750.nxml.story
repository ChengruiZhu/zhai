) were calculated. The ionic strength of the native plasma was approximately 0.15 while that of the citrated plasma was approximately 0.21. Conductivity and freezing point determinations on the plasmas described above were consistent with the idea that the ionic strength of the citrated plasma was significantly higher. The biphasic dilution curve, to which much significance has been attached in arriving at the "anticephalin" hypothesis, can be produced readily in the dog. Diluting dog plasma with "iso-ionic" or "hyper-ionic" NaCl solution abolished the biphasic phenomenon. Dilution with distilled water exaggerated the biphasic curve. These experiments suggest that the biphasic curve is an artifact of uncontrolled ionic strength. III. The prothrombin utilization rates of undiluted whole hemophilic dog blood and hemophilic dog blood diluted 1:2 with 0.85 per cent NaCl were found to be the same. IV. Ether extraction of both normal and hemophilic dog plasma removed fibrinogen and reduced somewhat the concentration of prothrombin. In treated normal plasma AHF was reduced to the level of untreated hemophilic plasma, thus producing a quasi-hemophilic plasma. Defibrination and ether extraction of both normal and hemophilic dog plasma "generated" clotting activity which shortened the clotting time of hemophilic plasma and was active in the thromboplastin generation test. The activity "generated" by defibrination and ether extraction of dog plasma was adsorbed by a BaSO
