The correlation between miR-200a expression and chemotherapeutic treatment efficacy of glioma was investigated. There were 45 patients with glioma in observation group whose cancer tissues, paracancerous tissues and serum samples were harvested. Additionally, there were 23 healthy subjects in the control group whose serum samples were also collected. The expression levels of miR-200a in cancer tissues, paracancerous tissues and serum samples were measured by real-time fluorescence-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The t-test and one-way ANOVA were used to compare the serum levels of miR-200a in patients with different clinical features involving age, sex, tumor location, pathological grade and tumor size. All patients in the observation group received temozolomide-based chemotherapy. The serum levels of miR-200a before chemotherapy were compared between patients who were responsive to chemotherapy [complete response (CR) and partial response (PR)] and patients who were not responsive to chemotherapy [stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD)]. The expression level of miR-200a in cancer tissue was significantly lower than that in paracancerous tissue (P<0.05). The serum level of miR-200a in patients in the observation group was lower than that in healthy subjects in the control group (P<0.05). No correlations were found between miR-200a expression and patient age, sex and tumor location (P>0.05), but miR-200a expression was found to correlate with pathological grade and tumor size (P<0.05). The expression levels of miR-200a in serum and cancer tissue in chemotherapy-non-responsive patients (SD and PD) were lower than those in chemotherapy-responsive patients (CR and PR, P<0.05). The serum levels of miR-200a in chemotherapy-responsive patients were lower than those in healthy subjects in the control group (P<0.05). Downregulation of miR-200a was associated with onset and progression of glioma, and changes of miR-200a expression levels in patients were correlated with chemotherapeutic treatment efficacy.
