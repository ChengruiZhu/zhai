 without developing neurotoxicity or allergic reactions. Consequently, this patient continued therapy with modified 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin treatment for four years, with stabilization of the disease. This case indicates that if oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy shows efficacy with no toxicity, the long-term administration of oxaliplatin would be effective and tolerable. Previously, the analysis of genomic polymorphisms in drug target genes has been important for explaining interindividual variations in the efficacy and toxicity of anti-cancer drugs. In the present patient, the glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) gene polymorphism, which is involved in the detoxification of platinum drugs, was analyzed. The genotype of the present case has been revealed as wild type (Ile/Ile) genotype. In addition, the associations between oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity and the GSTP1 polymorphism were also assessed. Certain studies have demonstrated that oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity occurs more frequently in patients with the Ile/Ile genotype, while others have demonstrated that those patients with the Val/Val or Ile/Val genotypes are more likely to develop neurotoxicity. Therefore, correlation between the GSTP1 polymorphism and oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity remains controversial. Overall, further development of individualized chemotherapy with an analysis of genomic polymorphisms in the drug target genes is required for the prophylaxis oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity.
