This report describes the cloning and sequencing of the major iron- regulated protein (termed Fbp) of Neisseria gonorrhoeae strain F62. Attempts to identify recombinants expressing the Fbp using specific antibody proved unsuccessful. Therefore, an alternative cloning strategy using oligonucleotide probes derived from NH2-terminal and tryptic fragments of this protein was used to identify short fragments of the gene. Using this methodology, the gene encoding the precursor of Fbp was cloned on three separate overlapping fragments and sequenced, and the amino acid sequence was deduced. These data were unambiguously confirmed by the known NH2-terminal amino acid sequence and were supported by the sequences from tryptic fragments that lie outside of this region. Using oligonucleotide probes, we were unable to obtain clones encoding the potential regulatory region of this protein. Therefore, the technique of inverse polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify a fragment containing an additional 200 bp. This fragment was cloned and sequenced and found to contain a consensus ribosome binding site and potential -10 and -35 sequences. Hybridization analysis of genomic DNA from gonococcal strain F62 indicated that only a single copy of the Fbp gene exists per genome. These results complement the biochemical characterization of the Fbp expressed by gonococci and further suggest that it has a role in iron-acquisition.
