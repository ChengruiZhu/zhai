Many studies manifested miRNA-100 was deregulated in various cancers, which indicated that miRNA-100 might be a potential biomarker of cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, the role of miRNA-100 was still uncertain. We searched for qualified studies using PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane library and CNKI databases. The diagnostic effect was evaluated by the pooled sensitivity, specificity, and other indexes. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for overall survival (OS) were calculated to assess the prognostic value. This meta-analysis included 7 and 19 studies about diagnosis and prognosis, respectively. The results of pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR) and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were 0.75 (95%CI: 0.71-0.78), 0.74 (95%CI: 0.69-0.78), 2.61 (95%CI: 1.81-3.76), 0.33 (95%CI: 0.24-0.45), 8.46 (95%CI: 4.85-14.77), respectively. And, the area under SROC curve (AUC) was 0.8141. We also found that lower expression of miRNA-100 in cancer tissues could significantly predict poorer prognosis in overall cancer (HR = 0.59, 95%CI: 0.39-0.90), especially in genital system tumors (HR = 0.42, 95%CI: 0.27-0.66, P = 0.431), bladder cancer (HR = 0.21, 95%CI: 0.06-0.73, P = 0.143) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (HR = 0.26, 95%CI: 0.13-0.52, P = 0.164). Our studies concluded that miRNA-100 has a certain value in diagnosis and it may indicate a poor prognosis of cancers.
