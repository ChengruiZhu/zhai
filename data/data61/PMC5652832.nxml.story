Cigarette smoking is a well-known risk factor of upper digestive diseases. Findings on alcohol's effect on these diseases are inconsistent and with the exception of its association with esophageal cancer, little is known about betel quid chewing. This study investigated the association between use of these three substances and upper digestive diseases. We collected data from 9,275 patients receiving upper endoscopies between April 2008 and December 2013. Polynomial regressions were used to analyze the association between risk factors and diseases of the esophagus, stomach and duodenum. Meta-analysis for use of these substances and esophageal diseases was also performed. Participants who simultaneously consumed cigarettes, alcohol and betel quid had a 17.28-fold risk of esophageal cancer (95% CI = 7.59–39.33), 2.99-fold risk of Barrette's esophagus (95% CI = 2.40–4.39), 1.60-fold risk of grade A-B erosive esophagitis (95% CI = 1.29–2.00), 2.00-fold risk of gastric ulcer (95% CI = 1.52–2.63), 2.12-fold risk of duodenitis (95% CI = 1.55–2.89) and 1.29-fold risk of duodenal ulcer (95% CI = 1.01–1.65). Concurrent consumption of more substances was associated with significantly higher risk of developing these diseases. Meta-analysis also revealed use of the three substances came with a high risk of esophageal diseases. In conclusions, cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking and betel quid chewing were associated with upper digestive tract diseases.
