In a eukaryotic organism such as the mouse, the complete transcriptional network contains âˆ¼15,000 genes and up to 225 million regulatory relationships between pairs of genes. Determining all of these relationships is currently intractable using traditional experimental techniques, and, thus, a comprehensive description of the entire mouse transcriptional network is elusive. Alternatively, one can apply the limited amount of experimental data to determine the entire transcriptional network at a less detailed, higher level. This is analogous to considering a map of the world resolved to the kilometer rather than to the millimeter. Here, we derive from mouse microarray data several high-scale transcriptional networks by determining the mutual effective regulatory influences of large modules of genes. In particular, global transcriptional networks containing 12 to 72 modules are derived, and analysis of these multiscale networks reveals properties of the transcriptional network that are universal at all scales (e.g., maintenance of homeostasis) and properties that vary as a function of scale (e.g., the fractions of module pairs that exert mutual regulation). In addition, we describe how cellular functions associated with large modules (those containing many genes) are composed of more specific functions associated with smaller modules.
