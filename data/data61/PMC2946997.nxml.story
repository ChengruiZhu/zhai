COONa), sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN), and sodium floride (NaF) at 2-minute time intervals. During a 46-hour time period, the hydration study was carried out using NaCl (150, 300 mM) and NaF (150 mM) at random intervals. The 14-hour study was carried out to assess the rehydration of corneal stroma after 6 hours of drying. During the 20-minute swelling studies in the first 2 minutes the rate of hydration in both camel and bovine corneas was high but gradually reduced in the 2–20-minute period. The rates and levels of hydration of camel and bovine cornea were not significantly different from each other in all the strengths of solutions. During the 46-hour swelling studies, the initial rate of hydration (0–2 hours) of camel and bovine stroma, in all solutions was significantly higher (Z = 0.056) compared to hydration during later hours (2–46 hours). Camel stromal hydration (high) in 150 mM NaCl was significantly higher compared to bovine stromal hydration in the same solution during the 10–24, and 24–46-hour time periods. Rehydration in camel stroma was significantly lower than bovine in 150 mM NaF. The 20-minute study showed that there was no selective affinity for particular ions in camel or bovine corneal stroma. Initial swelling in both corneal and bovine stroma is faster and more prominant compared to later swelling. The swelling in camel cornea is more prominant compared to bovine corneal stroma. This could be due to higher negatively charged keratin sulfate–proteoglycans in the stroma. Lower rehydration in camel cornea suggests stronger leaching of proteoglycans from stroma in NaF.
