Membrane potentials were recorded from rat parathyroid glands continuously perfused in vitro. At 1.5 mM external Ca++, the resting potential averages -73 +/- 5 mV (mean +/- SD, n = 66). On exposure to 2.5 mM Ca++, the cells depolarize reversibly to a potential of -34 +/- 8 mV (mean +/- SD). Depolarization to this value is complete in approximately 2-4 min, and repolarization on return to 1.5 mM Ca++ takes about the same time. The depolarizing action of high Ca++ is mimicked by all divalent cations tested, with the following order of effectiveness: Ca++ greater than Sr++ greater than Mg++ greater than Ba++ for alkali-earth metals, and Ca++ greater than Cd++ greater than Mn++ greater than Co++ greater than Zn++ for transition metals. Input resistance in 1.5 mM Ca++ was 24.35 +/- 14 M omega (mean +/- SD) and increased by an average factor of 2.43 +/- 0.8 after switching to 2.5 mM Ca++. The low value of input resistance suggests that cells are coupled by low-resistance junctions. The resting potential in low Ca++ is quite insensitive to removal of external Na+ or Cl-, but very sensitive to changes in external K+. Cells depolarize by 61 mV for a 10- fold increase in external K+. In high Ca++, membrane potential is less sensitive to an increase in external K+ and is unchanged by increasing K+ from 5 to 25 mM. Depolarization evoked by high Ca++ may be slowed, but is unchanged in amplitude by removal of external Na+ or Cl-. Organic (D600) and inorganic (Co++, Cd++, and Mn++) blockers of the Ca++ channels do not interfere with the electrical response to Ca++ changes. Our results show remarkable parallels to previous observations on the control of parathormone (PTH) release by Ca++. They suggest an association between membrane voltage and secretion that is very unusual: parathyroid cells secrete when fully polarized, and secrete less when depolarized. The extraordinary sensitivity of parathyroid cells to divalent cations leads us to hypothesize the existence in their membranes of a divalent cation receptor that controls membrane permeability (possibly to K+) and PTH secretion.
