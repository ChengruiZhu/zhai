Sepsis refers to life-threatening systemic inflammation, often caused by infection with bacteria that produce lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Glucocorticoids, immunosuppressive hormones produced by the adrenals, have been used to treat sepsis for over 50 y, but little is known about the role of endogenous (naturally occurring) glucocorticoids in systemic inflammation. Macrophages have been considered the primary source of inflammatory mediators (cytokines) and a target for glucocorticoid-mediated suppression. The possible role of another immune cell population, dendritic cells, has not been explored in detail. We created a mouse model in which the glucocorticoid receptor is selectively deleted in dendritic cells (DCs). We found that the elevation of glucocorticoids that accompanies sepsis protects mice from LPS-induced septic shock by suppressing DC production of IL-12, a cytokine that causes the secretion of other inflammatory mediators. In addition, LPS-induced glucocorticoids caused the death of a subset of DCs that are the primary producers of IL-12. Glucocorticoids were also found to be important for the phenomenon of "LPS tolerance", in which inoculation with low-dose LPS makes mice resistant to rechallenge with a high dose. This unexpected role of DC-produced IL-12 and its suppression by endogenous glucocorticoids may account, at least in part, for the known association of adrenal insufficiency and prolonged sepsis.
