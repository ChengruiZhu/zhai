The aim of this study was to investigate whether Huisheng oral solution (HSOS) has an inhibitory effect on the development of pulmonary thrombosis and metastasis in mice with Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC), and to explore the possible mechanisms involved. A mouse model of LLC was developed, and model mice were divided into either a treatment group or a control group to undergo treatment with HSOS or normal saline. Normal mice treated with saline were used as normal controls. On day 25 after treatment, blood samples were drawn from the eyes of half the mice in each group to determine blood cell counts and plasma levels of D-Dimer and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), while heart blood samples were collected from the remaining mice to measure the rate of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. For all mice, pathological analyses of the cerebrum, lung, mesentery, femoral vein, external iliac vein and spleen were performed. Tumors were weighed to assess the impact of HSOS treatment on tumor growth, and the number of thrombi, metastatic nodules and neovessels in the tumor tissue were counted. In addition, 24 normal New Zealand rabbits were divided into two groups and treated with either HSOS or normal saline to determine the rates of ADP-, collagen- or thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. Compared with the model group, HSOS treatment decreased the incidence of pulmonary thromboembolism and metastasis, the number of metastatic nodules, the plasma levels of D-dimer and VEGF, the rate of collagen-induced platelet aggregation in rabbits and the numbers of leukocytes and tumor neovessels (P<0.05 for all). It increased the thymus and spleen coefficients and the number of platelets (P<0.05 for all), but had no significant effect on thrombin-induced platelet aggregation in mice and rabbits, ADP-induced platelet aggregation in rabbits, or the number of red blood cells. The reduced rate of tumor growth was 9.7% in mice treated with HSOS. HSOS treatment effectively reduced the development of pulmonary thromboembolism and metastasis in mice bearing LLC via mechanisms possibly associated with ameliorating a blood hypercoagulable state, decreasing tumor angiogenesis and enhancing immunity.
