The liver continuously removes xenobiotic compounds from the blood in the mammalian body. Most computational models represent the liver as composed of few well-stirred subcompartments so that a spatially resolved simulation of hepatic perfusion and compound distribution right after drug administration is currently not available. To mechanistically describe the local distribution of compounds in liver tissue during first pass perfusion, we here present a computational model which combines micro-CT based vascular structures with mass transfer descriptions used in physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling. In the resulting spatio-temporal model, hepatic mass transfer is governed by the physiological architecture and the composition of the connecting hepatic tissue, such that hepatic heterogeneity and spatial distribution can be described mechanistically. The performance of our model is shown for exemplary compounds addressing key aspects of distribution and metabolization of drugs within a mouse liver. We furthermore investigate the impact of steatosis and carbon tetrachloride-induced liver necrosis. Notably, we find that our computational predictions are in qualitative agreement with previous experimental results in animal models. In the future, our spatially resolved model will be extended by including additional physiological information and by taking into account recirculation through the body.
