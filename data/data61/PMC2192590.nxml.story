We studied the effects of various chemokines including neutrophil- activating peptide 2 (NAP-2), beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG), platelet factor 4 (PF-4), melanoma growth stimulating activity (GRO), gamma interferon-induced protein (IP-10), regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha), MIP-1 beta, and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) on Immunoglobulin (IgE) and IgG4 production by human B cells. None of these chemokines with or without interleukin (IL-4), anti-CD40 or -CD58 monoclonal antibody (mAb), induced IgE and IgG4 production by B cells from nonatopic donors. However, RANTES and MIP-1 alpha selectively enhanced IgE and IgG4 production induced by IL-4 plus anti- CD40 or -CD58 mAb without affecting production of IgM, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgA1, or IgA2, whereas other chemokines failed to do so. Enhancement of IgE and IgG4 production by RANTES and MIP-1 alpha was specifically blocked by anti-RANTES mAb and anti-MIP-1 alpha antibody (Ab), respectively, whereas anti-IL-5 mAb, anti-IL-6 mAb, anti-IL-10 Ab, anti-IL-13 Ab, and anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha mAb failed to do so. Purified surface IgE positive (slgE4) and slgG4+ B cells generated either in vitro or in vivo spontaneously produced IgE and IgG4, respectively, whereas sIgE- and sIgG4- B cells failed to do so. RANTES and MIP-1 alpha enhanced spontaneous IgE and IgG4 production in slgE+ and slgG4- B cells, respectively, whereas neither RANTES nor MIP- 1 alpha did so in sIgE- or sIgG4- B cells. Purified sIgE4+ and sIgG4+, but not sIgE- or sIgG4- B cells, generated in vitro and in vivo expressed receptors for RANTES and MIP-1 alpha, whereas they failed to express receptors for other chemokines. These findings indicate that RANTES and MIP-1 alpha enhance IgE and IgG4 production by directly stimulating sIgE+ and sIgG4+ B cells.
