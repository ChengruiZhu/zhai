Although knowledge of the complex community of microbes that inhabits the human gut is constantly increasing, the successional process through which it develops during infancy remains poorly understood. Particularly, although gut microbiota composition is known to vary through time among infants, the effect of this variability on the functional capacities of the community has not been previously explored. We simultaneously analyze the taxonomic and functional development of the gut microbiota in a birth cohort of healthy infants during the first year of life, showing that individual instances of gut colonization vary in their temporal dynamics and that clear parallelisms exist between functional and taxonomic change. Therefore, taxonomic composition shapes the functional capacities of the microbiota, and, consequently, successional variability may affect host physiology, metabolism and immunity. Nevertheless, we detect some overarching trends in microbiota development, such as the existence of two distinct phases of succession, separated by the introduction of solid foods, and a strong directionality of change towards the taxonomic and functional composition of the maternal microbiota. Understanding the commonalities and differences among individual patterns of gut colonization in healthy infants will enable a better definition of the deviations in this process that result in microbiota imbalances and disease.
