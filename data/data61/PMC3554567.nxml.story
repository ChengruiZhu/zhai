Defects in leftâ€“right (L/R) patterning can lead to severe defects in the formation of the heart. In fact, three of the most common forms of congenital heart disease, transposition of the great arteries, chamber septation defects, and chamber isomerisms, can be caused by earlier defects in L/R asymmetry. The Nodal and Bmp signaling pathways influence the development of cardiac asymmetry, but how these signals function in this process is not well understood. In this report, we have clarified the specific roles for the Nodal versus Bmp pathways in the heart. We find that Nodal signals increase the rate of cardiac cell migration, while Bmp signals decrease cardiac cell velocities. We demonstrate that asymmetric Nodal signaling plays a critical role in directing asymmetry in the heart in contrast to reports suggesting that signaling via Bmp4 is the more critical pathway. In fact, we find that Bmp4 signaling is dispensable for correct asymmetry in the heart in the presence of asymmetric Nodal signals. In addition, we have identified a novel integration between these two pathways at the level of the transcription factor FoxH1, which is required for cardiac cell responsiveness to both Nodal and Bmp signals. Taken together, this work significantly increases our understanding of how the signals regulating cardiac asymmetry function and integrate to consistently establish cardiac laterality. These results also suggest that human congenital heart defects that have not been found to result from single mutations within individual genes may develop due to combinations of mutations within components of these two separate pathways.
