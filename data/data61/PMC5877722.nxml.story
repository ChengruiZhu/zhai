We have recently demonstrated that the amino-terminal domain of G protein coupled receptor kinase (GRK) type 5, (GRK5-NT) inhibits NFÎºB activity in cardiac cells leading to a significant amelioration of LVH. Since GRK5-NT is known to bind calmodulin, this study aimed to evaluate the functional role of GRK5-NT in the regulation of calcium-calmodulin-dependent transcription factors. We found that the overexpression of GRK5-NT in cardiomyoblasts significantly reduced the activation and the nuclear translocation of NFAT and its cofactor GATA-4 in response to phenylephrine (PE). These results were confirmed in vivo in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), in which intramyocardial adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of GRK5-NT reduced both wall thickness and ventricular mass by modulating NFAT and GATA-4 activity. To further verify in vitro the contribution of calmodulin in linking GRK5-NT to the NFAT/GATA-4 pathway, we examined the effects of a mutant of GRK5 (GRK5-NTPB), which is not able to bind calmodulin. When compared to GRK5-NT, GRK5-NTPB did not modify PE-induced NFAT and GATA-4 activation. In conclusion, this study identifies a double effect of GRK5-NT in the inhibition of LVH that is based on the regulation of multiple transcription factors through means of different mechanisms and proposes the amino-terminal sequence of GRK5 as a useful prototype for therapeutic purposes.
