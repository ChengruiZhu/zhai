In eukaryotes genetic crossovers are responsible for generating genetic diversity and ensuring the proper segregation of chromosomes. Genetic crossovers are tightly clustered in hotspots. Although the existence of hotspots in humans is clearly proven, mechanisms of their formation and the regulation of meiotic recombination in general remain poorly understood. An additional complication in studies of meiotic recombination is the fact that the direct experimental mapping of human hotspots on a genome-wide scale is not feasible with current methods. The best available indirect methods compute the position of hotspots from patterns of historic associations between genetic markers in population samples. In this study we determined the positions of genetic crossovers in ten pedigrees of European origin and then compared the positions of crossovers with the hotspots computed from HapMap data. Importantly, we find that the population-averaged computed map is in close agreement with the observed distribution of genetic crossovers. We also find that cryptic hotspots that are not easily detected in the computed European map can be more effectively identified if other populations are included in the analysis. Our analysis shows that high-resolution recombination profiles are highly similar between distantly related populations and that by including computed hotspots from several populations we can predict nearly all crossovers.
