The aim of this study was to investigate the pathological features of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) in children and to establish the effectiveness of screening and diagnosing ALCL with multiparameter flow cytometry immunophenotyping (FCI) of lymphoid tissue samples. A total of 121 lymph node tissue specimens obtained from 121 patients with a suspected diagnosis of lymphoma were analyzed with cytomorphological and FCI analysis. Fifteen cases were diagnosed as ALK-positive ALCL based on the pathological features and immunohistochemical results. Of these, there were 3 different types, common type (10 cases), lymphohistiocytic type (4 cases) and neutrophil-rich type (1 case). Thirteen cases (10 common, 2 lymphohistiocytic and 1 neutrophil-rich type) were diagnosed as ALCL using FCI. These cases were CD30-positive and aberrantly expressed at least two T-cell antigens, including CD4 (84.6%), CD2 (76.9%), CD7 (61.5%), CD3 (53.8%) and CD5 (38.4%). Neoplastic cells accounted for only a small proportion of the total cells in FCI, with a median of 19.3% (range, 7.9â€“31.8%), which was significantly higher than those in the control groups (all <1.0%). The sensitivity of FCI for diagnosing ALCL in lymph node samples was 86.7% with a specificity of 100%. The majority of neoplastic cells demonstrated high light forward and high light side scatter, similar to monocytes or granulocytes in dot plots. FCI may be used as an adjunct to histopathological examination for rapid and reliable diagnosis of pediatric ALCL. Flexible gating strategies and careful analysis are required to identify neoplastic cells with FCI.
