Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is an aggressive type of cancer, and its incidence and mortality rates are increasing worldwide. Mortalin is a highly conserved chaperone protein involved in multiple pathological and physiological processes, including anti-apoptosis, carcinogenesis and metastasis. The Bcl-2 family of proteins can be divided into pro-survival and pro-apoptotic members, including B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-like protein 4 (Bax). The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between mortalin, Bcl-2 and Bax, as well as the prognostic significance of the combined expression of mortalin, Bcl-2 and Bax in ICC. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the expression of mortalin, Bcl-2 and Bax in 116 ICC samples and to assess the association between expression of 3 markers and clinicopathological features of ICC patients. This revealed that ICC tumor tissues overexpressed mortalin and Bcl-2 and exhibited low expression of Bax in ICC tumor tissues compared with that in corresponding peritumoral samples. According to Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis, high expression of mortalin in ICC was positively correlated with Bcl-2 expression and negatively correlated with Bax expression. Furthermore, multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that mortalin was positively associated with Bcl-2, but not with Bax, in patients with ICC. Patients with ICC exhibiting high expression of mortalin/Bcl-2 or low expression of Bax were closely associated with a malignant ICC phenotype, a relatively low overall survival rate and a high recurrence rate. Multivariate analysis indicated that mortalin and Bcl-2 were independent prognostic indicators for ICC patients. Meanwhile, the concomitant overexpression of mortalin and Bcl-2 and the low expression of Bax were independent markers for predicting a relatively poor prognosis of ICC. The overexpression of mortalin and Bcl-2 and/or the low expression of Bax are implicated in the anti-apoptotic effect and tumor progression of ICC. Mortalin or Bcl-2, or a combination of mortalin, Bcl-2 and Bax may be used to predict the prognosis of ICC, as well as potential therapeutic targets.
