The precise biophysical characterization of the mechanisms of the protein conformational changes controlled by a nucleotide remains a challenge in biology. Molecular dynamics simulations of proteins in different nucleotide-binding states contain information on the nucleotide-dependent conformational dynamics. However, it is difficult to extract relevant information about the conformation-induced mechanism from the raw molecular dynamics data. Herein, we addressed this issue for the major ATP-dependent molecular chaperones Hsp70 s, which contribute to crucial cellular processes and are involved in several neurodegenerative diseases and in cancer. To function, Hsp70 undergoes several conformational changes controlled by the state of its nucleotide-binding domain. We demonstrated that the analysis of the effective free-energy landscape of the protein projected along the amino-acid sequence and computed from the molecular dynamics simulations of Hsp70 in different nucleotide-binding states, holds the key to identify the key residues of the conformational induced pathway. Identification of the key residues involved in the propagation of the structural changes induced by ATP binding offer alternative druggable specific sites other than the ligand binding clefts. The methodology developed for Hsp70 is general and can be adapted to any ligand induced conformational change in proteins.
