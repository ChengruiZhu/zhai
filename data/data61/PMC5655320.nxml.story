Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) represent a heterogeneous group of diseases that occur following transplantation. Large granular lymphocytic (LGL) lymphocytosis is one type of PTLD, ranging from reactive polyclonal self-limited expansion to oligo/monoclonal lymphocytosis or even to overt leukaemia. LGL lymphocytosis in transplant recipients may present as a relatively indolent version of the condition and may be more common than reported, but its natural history and clinical course have not been well described, and the lack of a reliable classification system has limited studies on this disease. Patients with unexplained cytopenias, autoimmune manifestations, or unexpected remissions may be mislabelled. The purpose of this review was to evaluate the clinical features, immunophenotypes, etiopathogenesis, diagnosis, outcomes and treatment of post-transplantation LGL lymphocytosis. In conclusion, LGL lymphocytosis is a frequent occurrence after transplantation that correlates with certain procedural variables and post-transplant events. LGL lymphocytosis should be considered in patients with unexplained lymphocytosis or when pancytopenia develops after transplantation. The diagnosis of LGL lymphocytosis requires a demonstration of monoclonality, but clonality does not indicate malignancy. Additional studies are necessary to further delineate the potential effects of large granular lymphocytes in the long-term prognosis of post-transplant patients.
