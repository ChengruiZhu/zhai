 cerebrospinal fluid drainage in 110 (19.8%), craniotomy in 338 (60.7%) and application of both methods in 108 patients (19.4%). Total mortality rate was estimated with 23.5%. GCS<8, age over 70 years, intraventricular and basal ganglia hemorrhage, coumadin medication, combination of co-morbidities, hypertensive hemorrhage and postoperative re-bleeding were statistically significant risk factors for worse outcome (GOS 1 and 2) in the operated group. Similar to the observations of the operated group, GCS<8, age over 70 years and coumadin medication were statistically significant for worse outcome in the conservative group. In contrast, lobar plus basal ganglia ICH and multi-lobar hemorrhages were the most significant factors for worse outcome in the conservative group. The results of our study show that ICH remains a multifarious disease and challenges neurosurgeons repeatedly. Selection of the treatment modality and prediction for neurofunc-tional outcome underlies various parameters. Treatment recommendations of ICH remain an unsolved issue. The consideration of the GCS grade at admission is the most important predictive factor. Old age is not an absolute contraindication for surgery, but cumulative multi-morbidity, especially cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases and oral anticoagulant therapy should be regarded critically in view of surgical treatment.
