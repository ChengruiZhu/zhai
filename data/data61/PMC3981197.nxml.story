Fluoroquinolone medications have been shown to contribute to tendinopathies, cardiotoxicity, and neurotoxicity. Low back pain is a common musculoskeletal condition for which chiropractic treatment is most often sought. This case report details a patient presenting with low back pain and a history of fluoroquinolone toxicity. The patient was initially treated with chiropractic manipulation, which increased her symptoms. She was then referred to an osteopathic physician who treated the patient with intravenous antioxidants and amino acids, an elimination diet, and probiotic supplementation. Within 4 months of therapy, the patient reported a decrease in pain, a resolution of her dizziness, shortness of breath, panic attacks, tachycardia, and blurred vision. After an additional 8 weeks of antioxidant therapy, she reported further reductions in pain and improved disability. People susceptible to fluoroquinolone toxicity may present with common musculoskeletal symptoms. A past medical history and medication history may help to identify this population of patients. People presenting with fluoroquinolone toxicity may have unidentified contributing factors that predispose them to this anomaly. This patient reported improvements in pain and disability following antioxidant amino acid therapy for a total of 6 months. The natural history of fluoroquinolone toxicity is unknown and may account for the observed improvements.
