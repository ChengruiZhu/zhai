We substantiated the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) activation in the protective effect of apigenin against the myocardial infarction (MI) in diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal administration of a single dose of streptozotocin (55 mg/kg). The study groups included diabetic rats receiving vehicle, apigenin (75 mg/kg/day, orally), GW9662 (1 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneally), and a combination of apigenin and GW9662 for 14 days. The MI was induced in all the study groups except the diabetic control group by subcutaneous injection of 100 mg/kg/day of isoproterenol on the two terminal days. The diabetes and isoproterenol-induced MI was evident as a reduction in the maximal positive and negative rate of developed left ventricular pressure and an increase in the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. The activities of creatine kinase on myocardial bundle (CK-MB) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were also reduced. Apigenin treatment prevented the hemodynamic perturbations, restored the left ventricular function and reinstated a balanced redox status. It protected rats against an MI by attenuating myonecrosis, edema, cell death, and oxidative stress. GW9662, a PPAR-γ antagonist reversed the myocardial protection conferred by apigenin. Further, an increase in the PPAR-γ expression in the myocardium of the rats receiving apigenin reinforces the role of PPAR-γ pathway activation in the cardioprotective effects of apigenin.
