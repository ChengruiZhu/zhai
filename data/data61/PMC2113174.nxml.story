1- Deoxynojirimycin is a specific inhibitor of glucosidases I and II, the first enzymes that process N-linked oligosaccharides after their transfer to polypeptides in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. In a pulse- chase experiment, 1- deoxynojirimycin greatly reduced the rate of secretion of alpha 1-antitrypsin and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin by human hepatoma HepG2 cells, but had marginal effects on secretion of the glycoproteins C3 and transferrin, or of albumin. As judged by equilibrium gradient centrifugation, 1- deoxynojirimycin caused alpha 1- antitrypsin and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin to accumulate in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The oligosaccharides on cell-associated alpha 1- antitrypsin and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin synthesized in the presence of 1- deoxynojirimycin , remained sensitive to Endoglycosidase H and most likely had the structure Glu1- 3Man9GlcNAc2 . Tunicamycin, an antibiotic that inhibits addition of N-linked oligosaccharide units to glycoproteins, had a similar differential effect on secretion of these proteins. Swainsonine , an inhibitor of the Golgi enzyme alpha- mannosidase II, had no effect on the rates of protein secretion, although the proteins were in this case secreted with an abnormal N- linked, partially complex, oligosaccharide. We conclude that the movement of alpha 1-antitrypsin and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi requires that the N-linked oligosaccharides be processed to at least the Man9GlcNAc2 form; possibly this oligosaccharide forms part of the recognition site of a transport receptor for certain secretory proteins.
