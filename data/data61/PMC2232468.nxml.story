 photoreceptors to natural-like fluctuating light contrast stimulation and intracellular current injection when the cells were adapted over a 4-log unit light intensity range at 25°C. This dual stimulation allowed us to characterize how an increase in the mean light intensity causes the phototransduction cascade and photoreceptor membrane to produce larger, faster and increasingly accurate voltage responses to a given contrast. Using signal and noise analysis, this appears to be associated with an increased summation of smaller and faster elementary responses (i.e., bumps), whose latency distribution stays relatively unchanged at different mean light intensity levels. As the phototransduction cascade increases, the size and speed of the signals (light current) at higher adapting backgrounds and, in conjunction with the photoreceptor membrane, reduces the light-induced voltage noise, and the photoreceptor signal-to-noise ratio improves and extends to a higher bandwidth. Because the voltage responses to light contrasts are much slower than those evoked by current injection, the photoreceptor membrane does not limit the speed of the phototransduction cascade, but it does filter the associated high frequency noise. The photoreceptor information capacity increases with light adaptation and starts to saturate at ∼200 bits/s as the speed of the chemical reactions inside a fixed number of transduction units, possibly microvilli, is approaching its maximum.
