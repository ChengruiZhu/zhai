The adult human brain consumes more than 20% of the resting metabolism, despite constituting only 2% of the bodyâ€™s mass. Most energy is consumed by the cerebral cortex with billions of neurons, mainly to restore ion gradients across membranes for generating and propagating action potentials and synaptic transmission. Even small increases in the average spike rate of cortical neurons could cause the cortex to exceed the energy budget for the whole brain. Consequently, the cortex is likely to be under considerable selective pressure to reduce spike rates but to maintain efficient information processing. Experimentally, cortical activities are ubiquitously observed at multiple scales with prominent features: irregular individual firing, synchronized oscillations and neuronal avalanches. Do these features of cortical activities reflect cost-efficiency on the aspect of information capacity? We employ a generic but biologically plausible local neural circuit to compare various dynamical modes with different degrees of synchrony. Our simulations show that these features of cortical activities can be observed simultaneously and their co-emergence indeed robustly achieves maximal energy efficiency and minimal energy cost. Our work thus suggests that basic neurobiological and dynamical mechanisms can support the foundation for efficient neural information processing under the energy constraint.
