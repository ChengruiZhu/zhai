Periocular malignancies represent between 5% and 10% of all types of skin cancers. The incidence of eyelid (but also the periocular located) malignancies seems to differ in distribution across the continents. The incidence of eyelid tumours (but also the periocular located tumours) in a predominantly white population determined that BCC is the most common malignant periocular eyelid tumour in whites. This finding has been replicated consistently throughout the literature, with BCC representing 85â€“95% of all eyelid malignancies, SCC representing 3.4 - 12.6%, Seb Ca representing 0.6 - 10.2%, and both melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma representing less than 1%. Most periocular skin cancers are associated with ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure. Ultraviolet radiation causes local immune suppression, which, coupled with DNA abnormalities in tumour suppressor genes and oncogenes, leads to the development of skin cancers. We are presenting a 62 - year - old patient with a small nodule about 2 cm away from the lower lid of his left eye. A tumour was surgically treated. Several years later there was a tumour relapse, treated with radiotherapy and subsequent chemotherapy with Endoxan and Cisplatin. After the second relapse, he was treated surgically in general anaesthesia by orbital exenteration, removal of the orbital floor and resection of zygomatic bone and the maxillary sinus. A couple of months later, he developed a tumour relapse in the scars and the area of a primary tumour with tumour progression. A possible therapy with Cetuximab or radiation therapy was discussed as a possible treatment option.
