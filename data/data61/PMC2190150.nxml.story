Immunoglobulin (Ig) is present on a large fraction of T cells from unfractionated lymphocytes activated by in vitro stimulation with H-2- incompatible cells (mixed lymphocyte reaction [MLR]). Removal of bursa equivalent-derived (B) cells from the responder cell population before mixed culture, by filtration through nylon wool columns, reduces the percentage of Ig-bearing responder T blasts to background levels. Thus, Ig on the T blast is probably of B cell origin. A large fraction of T blasts activated against the stimulator cells. This staining occurs with "early" and hyperimmune alloantisera, including the 7S fraction of the latter. B-depleted responder cells were activated against a mixture of two different stimulator cells and the resulting T blasts stained with different concentrations of sera directed either against one or both stimulator cells. We obtained results which strongly suggest that most or all responder T blasts stain with only one antistimulator serum. When antisera directed against different segments of the H-2 complex of the stimulator cells were used, it seemed that most responder T cells only bound antibody directed against a single segment. We propose that T cells activated in MLR carry stimulator alloantigens on their surface, and that this is due to specific antigen binding, not requiring the presence of B-cell-derived antibody. These histocompatibility antigen-binding T blasts can be detected by appropriate antistimulator alloantibodies.
