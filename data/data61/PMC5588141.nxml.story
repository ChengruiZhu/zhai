The characteristics of the proliferation of B-cell activating factor (BAFF) and the proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) mRNA expression in mononuclear cell in multiple myeloma patients were detected, and the correlation was analyzed between the BAFF and APRIL concentrations in plasma and tumor burden parameters of multiple myeloma. Bone marrow samples from 60 patients with multiple myeloma and 20 healthy persons taken as controls, were collected. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) were harvested, and plasma was extracted. BAFF and APRIL mRNA expression was quantified using real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR in the BMMCs. ELISA was used to detect the characteristics of gene and protein expression of BAFF and APRIL in KM3 cell line. The BAFF and APRIL mRNA expression in initial treatment group, remission group and non-remission group were markedly higher than that in control group (P<0.05). The expression in initial treatment group and non-remission group was markedly higher than that of the control group (P<0.05). APRIL mRNA expression in mononuclear cells in stage III patients was markedly higher than that in stage II patients (P<0.05). There was positive correlation between APRIL and BAFF concentration in multiple myeloma (P=0.0027). In conclusion, for the gene and protein expression of BAFF and APRIL in patients with multiple myeloma, the initial treatment group and non-remission are higher than control and remission group. The higher the stage was, the more the factors were expressed. Characteristics of expression of BAFF and APRIL may be used as a new index to evaluate the prognosis of multiple myeloma.
