 The kinetics of interaction between potential, chemical equilibrium, and electromotance in the excitable system of nerve are analyzed. The theoretical system has the following properties: It gives rise to two electromotances each of which depends directly on a chemical equilibrium. The equilibria are determined by the potential across the system. After a sudden potential shift the equilibria reach their new value with an exponential time course, the time constant of which is determined by the rate constants of the two reactions. The rate constants are different due to different activation energies. The two electromotances give rise to potentials of opposite sign. The total potential produced by the system is equal to the sum of the two potentials. The two equilibria are thus determined by any externally applied potential as well as by the sum of the internally produced potentials. The dependence of the equilibria on the potential is calculated from first principles. The equations which describe this system are solved by an analogue computer, which gives instantaneous solutions of the total internal potential as a function of time and any voltage applied from an external source. Comparison between recorded and computed action potentials shows excellent agreement under all experimental conditions. The electromotances might originate from a Ca
