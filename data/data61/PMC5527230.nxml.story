Hematopoiesis is a balance among quiescence, self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation, which is believed to be firmly adjusted through interactions between hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) with the microenvironment. This microenvironment is derived from a common progenitor of mesenchymal origin and its signals should be capable of regulating the cellular memory of transcriptional situation and lead to an exchange of stem cell genes expression. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have self-renewal and differentiation capacity into tissues of mesodermal origin, and these cells can support hematopoiesis through release various molecules that play a crucial role in migration, homing, self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation of HSPCs. Studies on the effects of MSCs on HSPC differentiation can develop modern solutions in the treatment of patients with hematologic disorders for more effective Bone Marrow (BM) transplantation in the near future. However, considerable challenges remain on realization of how paracrine mechanisms of MSCs act on the target tissues, and how to design a therapeutic regimen with various paracrine factors in order to achieve optimal results for tissue conservation and regeneration. The aim of this review is to characterize and consider the related aspects of the ability of MSCs secretome in protection of hematopoiesis.
