 1. An optical system is described which furnishes large flickering fields whose brightness, even when reduced with monochromatic filters, is capable of covering the complete range of the relation between critical frequency and intensity. 2. For a centrally located test field of 19° diameter, with light from different parts of the spectrum, the data divide into a low intensity section identified with rod function, and a high intensity section identified with cone function. The transition between the two sections is marked by an inflection point which is sharp, except for 450 and 490 mµ where, though clearly present, it is somewhat rounded. 3. The intensity range covered by the flicker function is smallest in the red, and increases steadily as the wave-length decreases. The increase is due entirely to the extent of the low intensity, rod section which is smallest (non-existent for S. S.) in the red and largest in the violet. The high intensity cone portion for all colors is in the same position on the intensity axis, and the only effect of decreasing wave-length is to shift the rod section to lower intensities without changing its shape. 4. The measurements are faithfully described by two similar equations, one for the rods and one for the cones, both equations being derived from the general stationary state equation already used for various visual functions.
