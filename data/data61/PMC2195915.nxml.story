Hematogenous precursors repopulate the thymus of normal adult mice, but it is not known whether this process is continuous or intermittent. Here, two approaches were used to demonstrate that the importation of prothymocytes in adult life is a gated phenomenon. In the first, age-dependent receptivity to thymic chimerism was studied in nonirradiated Ly 5 congenic mice by quantitative intrathymic and intravenous bone marrow (BM) adoptive transfer assays. In the second, the kinetics of importation of blood-borne prothymocytes was determined by timed separation of parabiotic mice. The results showed that >60% of 3–18-wk-old mice developed thymic chimerism after intrathymic injection of BM cells, and that the levels of chimerism (range, 5–90% donor-origin cells) varied cyclically (periodicity, 3 to 5 wk). In contrast, only 11–14% of intravenously injected recipients became chimeric, and chimerism occurred intermittently (receptive period ∼1 wk; refractory period ∼3 wk). In the intravenously injected mice, chimerism occurred simultaneously in both thymic lobes; gate opening occurred only after most intrathymic niches for prothymocytes had emptied; and the ensuing wave of thymocytopoiesis encompassed two periods of gating. These kinetics were confirmed in parabiotic mice, and in cohorts of mice in whom gating was synchronized by an initial intrathymic injection of BM cells. In addition, a protocol was developed by which sequential intravenous injections of BM cells over a 3 to 4 wk period routinely induces thymic chimerism in the apparent absence of stem cell chimerism. Hence, the results not only provide a new paradigm for the regulation of prothymocyte importation during adult life, but may also have applied implications for the selective induction of thymocytopoiesis in nonmyeloablated hosts.
