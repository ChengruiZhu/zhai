A brief survey is given of current views correlating the ultrastructural and permeability characteristics of capillaries. Observations based on the use of peroxidase (mol wt 40,000), as an in vivo, and colloidal lanthanum, as an in vitro, ultrastructural tracer, are presented. In capillaries with "continuous" endothelium, the endothelial intercellular junctions are thought to be permeable to the tracers, and are regarded as maculae occludentes rather than zonulae occludentes, with a gap of about 40 A in width between the maculae. Some evidence for vesicular transport is also presented. It is inferred that the cell junctions are the morphological equivalent of the small-pore system, and the vesicles the equivalent of the large-pore system. Peroxidase does not apparently cross brain capillaries: the endothelial cell junctions are regarded as zonulae occludentes, and vesicles do not appear to transport across the endothelium. This is regarded as the morphological equivalent of the blood-brain barrier for relatively large molecules. The tracers appear to permeate the fenestrae of fenestrated capillaries, and the high permeability of these capillaries to large molecules is attributed to the fenestrae. Capillaries with discontinuous endothelium readily allow passage of the tracers through the intercellular gaps. A continuous basement membrane may act as a relatively coarse filter for large molecules. In general, the morphology of capillaries correlates well with physiological observations.
