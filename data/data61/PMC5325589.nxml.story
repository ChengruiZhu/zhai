This work is the result of our search for the mechanism of action of Apolipoprotein D (ApoD), a neuroprotective lipid-binding protein that confers cell resistance to oxidative stress. ApoD is one of the few genes consistently over-expressed in the aging brain of all vertebrate species, and no nervous system disease has been found concurring without ApoD over-expression. All evidence supports ApoD as an endogenous mechanism of protection. We demonstrate here that this extracellular lipid binding protein is endocytosed and targeted in a finely controlled way to subsets of lysosomes in need of protection, those most sensitive to oxidative stress. ApoD reveals the existence of biologically relevant lysosomal heterogeneity that conditions the oxidation state of cells, their phagocytic or autophagic capacity, and the final output in neurodegenerative conditions. The stable presence of ApoD in lysosomes is sufficient and necessary for lysosomes to recover from oxidation-induced membrane permeabilization and loss of proton gradients. ApoD-mediated control of lysosomal membrane integrity represents a new cell-protection mechanism at the hub of many cellular functions, and is critical for the outcome of a wide variety of neurodegenerative diseases. Therapeutic opportunities open, by providing a route of entry and a repair mechanism for lysosomes in pathological situations.
