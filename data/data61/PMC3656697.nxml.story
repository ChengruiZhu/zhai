Seventeen subjects were admitted, but in 2 of them symptoms were transitory and magnetic resonance imaging was negative. Two patients were excluded due to persisting sensory deficits. The remaining 13 (11 males and 2 females) patients with an average age of 62.9 (± 13.4) years were included, representing 1.5% of all ischemic strokes diagnosed at the stroke unit in the given period. All patients were right-handed, and the dominant hand was affected only in 4 (31%). The average Medical Research Council's scale score was 3.1 (± 1.4) on admission, and classified as bad. On follow-up, which occurred on average 29.8 (± 19.8) months after the stroke, the score was 4.6 (± 0.4) and was classified as fair to good. No patient experienced a new stroke. The outcome was good to excellent in 10 patients (77%). Two patients died (15%), 1 of probable cardiac arrest and 1 of unknown cause. One patient did not participate in the follow-up. The majority of patients had evidence of both small artery (77%) and large artery (85%) disease. On average, there were 1.6 (± 0.4) new ischemic lesions per patient. Six patients had a solitary lesion (46%). In 5 of them, small artery occlusion was considered the probable stroke mechanism. In 4 cases, the stroke was of undetermined etiology. Three patients had atrial fibrillation, and in 2 of them cardioembolism was the probable stroke mechanism. Two patients with definite large artery atherosclerosis underwent carotid endarterectomy, and 1 of them had comorbid atrial fibrillation.
