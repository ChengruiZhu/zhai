DNA damage from the environment is very common in animal cells, yet most of the time they are repaired efficiently and the integrity of the hereditary material is maintained. The genomes of most eukaryotes, such as humans and fruitflies, contain repeated DNAs that pose major challenges to genome stability. For example, recombination between repeated DNAs can result in chromosome rearrangements, a hallmark of cancer and birth defects. Repeated DNAs are contained within the part of the genome known as heterochromatin, which is characterized by a special type of chromatin packaging not prevalent in the rest of the genome, known as euchromatin. We use cytological and genetic analyses of the fruitfly model organism and demonstrate that the chromatin structure of heterochromatin plays a key role in efficient DNA damage detection and/or repair of repeated DNAs. Loss of a key chromatin modification (methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9) leads to increased spontaneous DNA damage specific to heterochromatin and activation of DNA repair cell cycle checkpoints. If left unrepaired, these DNA breaks cause cellular and organismal death. Remarkably, human euchromatin and fruitfly heterochromatin share similar physical features, such as repeated DNA content, intron lengths, and open reading frame sizes. Understanding heterochromatic DNA damage repair will yield critical information about how mammalian genome stability is maintained and how defects in these processes may contribute to human disease.
