Despite the efforts devoted to surveying HIV genetic diversity and the development of an effective vaccine, there is still no consensus on the extent to which the former prejudices the latter. Experimental studies show that escape from cell-mediated immunity is selected for in HIV and SIV, and sometimes very quickly. Conversely, escape mutants may be selected against at transmission, so how much does this selection within individuals influence the genotype of the circulating HIV population overall? Kosakovsky Pond, Leigh Brown, and colleagues have developed a new statistical approach to address this question. Using sequences from the globally most abundant HIV subtype (subtype C), the authors directly compared virus of the same subtype infecting genetically different human populations. They show at least half of the amino acid sites selected within individuals are not selected at a population level, and they identify six amino acid sites in the RT gene that are selected differentially between populations. We can now partition molecular adaptation between individual and population components for whatever genes may be included in candidate vaccines, in the target populations themselves. The methods are also important beyond the HIV world, where analogous issues arise in the more general question of the evolution of virulence in pathogens.
