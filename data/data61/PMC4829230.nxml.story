Bacterial behavior is responsive to a multitude of soluble molecular cues. Among them are self-secreted autoinducers that control quorum sensing (QS) processes. While new quorum sensing systems are constantly being discovered, several systems have been well defined in terms of their molecular and genetic topologies, each influencing a variety of resultant phenotypes. These quorum sensing systems include LuxIR homologs that use an array of species specific autoinducers and Lsr system homologs that share a single autoinducer among numerous species. Here we suggest that the regulatory topology of these two systems mark them as opposites of a sort. Whereas the LuxIR system bears a strong positive intercellular feedback mechanism, the Lsr system bears strong negative intercellular feedback. In our simulations these differences are manifested in distinct patterns of signaling. This was readily visualized in the outward spread of autogenous LuxIR expression in a growing bacterial 2D ‘colony’ whereas a dispersed activity was produced by autogenous Lsr expression in an otherwise identical colony. Here, this dispersed activity is a reflection of bimodal Lsr expression. We show that this bimodality could arise from desynchronized Lsr driven autoinducer import (intercellular negative feedback). This may have consequences on the arrangement of downstream phenotypes.
