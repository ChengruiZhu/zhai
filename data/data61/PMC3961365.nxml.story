Heart attack, known medically as myocardial infarction, often occurs as a result of partial shortage of blood supply to a portion of the heart, leading to the death of heart muscle cells. Following myocardial infarction, complications might arise, including arrhythmia, myocardial rupture, left ventricular dysfunction, and heart failure. Although myocardial infarction can be quickly diagnosed using a various number of tests, including blood tests and electrocardiography, there have been no available prognostic tests to predict the long-term outcome in response to myocardial infarction. Here, we present a framework to analyze how the left ventricle responds to myocardial infarction by combining protein interactome and experimental results retrieved from published human studies. The framework organized current understanding of molecular interactions specific to myocardial infarction, cellular responses, and biological processes to quantify left ventricular remodeling process. Specifically, our knowledge map showed that transcriptional activity, inflammatory response, and extracellular matrix remodeling are the main functional themes post myocardial infarction. In addition, text analytics of relevant abstracts revealed differentiated protein expressions in plasma or serum expressions from patients with myocardial infarction. Using this data, we predicted expression levels of other proteins following myocardial infarction.
