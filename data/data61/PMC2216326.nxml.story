We used the "perforated-patch" technique (Horn, R., and A. Marty, 1988. Journal of General Physiology. 92:145-159) to examine the effects of adrenergic agonists on the membrane potentials and membrane currents in isolated cultured brown fat cells from neonatal rats. In contrast to our previous results using traditional whole-cell patch clamp, 1-23-d cultured brown fat cells clamped with the perforated patch consistently showed vigorous membrane responses to both alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists, suggesting that cytoplasmic components essential for the thermogenic response are lost in whole-cell experiments. The membrane responses to adrenergic stimulation varied from cell to cell but were consistent for a given cell. Responses to bath-applied norepinephrine in voltage-clamped cells had three possible components: (a) a fast transient inward current, (b) a slower outward current carried by K+ that often oscillated in amplitude, and (c) a sustained inward current largely by Na+. The fast inward and outward currents were activated by alpha-adrenergic agonists while the slow inward current was mediated by beta-adrenergic agonists. Oscillating outward currents were the most frequently seen response to norepinephrine stimulation. Activation of this current, termed IK,NE, was independent of voltage and seemed to be carried by Ca2(+)-activated K channels since the current oscillated in amplitude at constant membrane potential and gradually decreased when the cells were bathed with calcium-free external solution. IK,NE had a novel pharmacology in that it could be blocked by 4-aminopyridine, tetraethylammonium, apamin, and charybdotoxin. Both IK,NE and the voltage-gated K channels also present in brown fat (Lucero, M. T., and P. A. Pappone, 1989a. Journal of General Physiology. 93:451-472) may play a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis in the face of the high metabolic activity involved in thermogenesis.
