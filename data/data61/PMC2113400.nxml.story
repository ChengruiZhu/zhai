The intracellular spatial relationships between elements of the Golgi apparatus (GA) and microtubules in interphase cells have been explored by double immunofluorescence microscopy. By using cultured cells infected with the temperature-sensitive Orsay-45 mutant of vesicular stomatitis virus and a temperature shift-down protocol, we visualized functional elements of the GA by immunolabeling of the G protein of the virus that was arrested in the GA during its intracellular passage to the plasma membrane 13 min after the temperature shift-down. Complete disassembly of the cytoplasmic microtubules by nocodazole at the nonpermissive temperature before the temperature shift led to the dispersal of the GA elements, from their normal compact perinuclear configuration close to the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) into the cell periphery. Washout of the nocodazole that led to the reassembly of the microtubules from the MTOC also led to the recompaction of the GA elements to their normal configuration. During this recompaction process, GA elements were seen in close lateral apposition to microtubules. In cells treated with nocodazole followed by taxol, an MTOC developed, but most of the microtubules were free of the MTOC and were assembled into bundles in the cell periphery. Under these circumstances, the GA elements that had been dispersed into the cell periphery by the nocodazole treatment remained dispersed despite the presence of an MTOC. In cells treated directly with taxol, free microtubules were seen in the cytoplasm in widely different, bundled configurations from one cell to another, but, in each case, elements of the GA appeared to be associated with one of the two end regions of the microtubule bundles, and to be uncorrelated with the locations of the vimentin intermediate filaments in these cells. These results are interpreted to suggest two types of associations of elements of the GA with microtubules: one lateral, and the other (more stable) end-on. The end-on association is suggested to involve the minus-end regions of microtubules, and it is proposed that this accounts for the GA-MTOC association in normal cells.
