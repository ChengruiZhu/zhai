 Pigment epithelial cells of the frog's retina have been examined by methods of electron microscopy with special attention focused on the fine structure of the endoplasmic reticulum and the myeloid bodies. These cells, as reported previously, send apical prolongations into the spaces between the rod outer segments, and within these extensions, pigment migrates in response to light stimulation. The cytoplasm of these cells is filled with a compact lattice of membrane-limited tubules, the surfaces of which are smooth or particle-free. In this respect, the endoplasmic reticulum here resembles that encountered in cells which produce lipid-rich secretions. The myeloid bodies comprise paired membranes arranged in stacks shaped like biconvex lenses. At their margins the membranes are continuous with elements of the ER and in consequence of this the myeloid body is referred to as a differentiation of the reticulum. The paired membranes resemble in their thickness and spacings those which make up the outer segments; they are therefore regarded as intracellular photoreceptors of possible significance in the activation of pigment migration and other physiologic functions of these cells. The fuscin granules are enclosed in membranes which are also continuous with those of the ER. The granules seem to move independently of the prolongations in which they are contained. The report also describes the fine structure of the terminal bar apparatus, the fibrous layer intervening between the epithelium and the choroid blood vessels, and comments on the functions of the organelles depicted.
