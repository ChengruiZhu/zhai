NRs are key molecules controlling development, metabolism, and reproduction in metazoans. Since NRs are implicated in many human diseases such as cancer, metabolic syndrome, and hormone resistance, they are important pharmaceutical targets and are under intense scrutiny to better understand their biological functions. In the present study, we determined the expression patterns of all NR genes as well as their main transcriptional coregulators during zebrafish development. We used zebrafish because the transparency of its embryo allows us to perform whole-mount in situ hybridization from early development to late organogenesis. This complete developmental profiling offers an unprecedented view of NR expression during embryogenesis, uncovering their potential function during central nervous system and retina formation. We observed that in contrast to NR genes, only a few coregulators exhibit a restricted expression pattern, suggesting that tissue specificity of hormone action is conferred more by the receptors than by their coregulators. Lastly, by evolutionary analysis of expression pattern divergence of duplicated genes, we observed that neofunctionalization occurs at the levels of both protein sequence and mRNA expression patterns. Taken together, our data provide the starting point for functional analysis of an entire gene family during development and call for the study of the intersection between metabolism and development.
