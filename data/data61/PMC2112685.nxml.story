Monoclonal antibodies (mAB) were raised to be used as probes to identify cytoplasmic components associated with intermediate filaments (IF). Four hybridomas (B27, B76, B78, and B100) secreting mAB were generated by fusing mouse myeloma cells with the spleen cells of mice immunized intraperitoneally with Triton-high salt insoluble materials from BHK-21 cells. This insoluble material consists mostly of IF, a small number of microfilaments, and some polyribosomes. Biochemical studies show that the Triton-insoluble materials contain many proteins, including vimentin (decamin) and desmin. Immunofluorescence microscopy of BHK-21 cells stained with the four mAB showed that these mAB decorate the IF in a dotted pattern. Double staining with polyclonal antibody to vimentin confirmed the reactivity of the mAB with the IF. These mAB also stained the vimentin-containing filament system in a variety of other cells including epithelial cells (PTK1 and HeLa) and cells of astroglial origin. Histological studies showed that mAB-B100 stained many types of tissue including epidermis, smooth muscle, and subdermis pericytes, but not the white matter nor the gray matter of the cerebellum and spinal cord. Immunoelectron microscopy with colloidal gold has shown that the mAB-B100 decorated the IF in clusters or aggregates around proteinaceous materials associated with the filaments. Results of immunoprecipitation indicate that mAB-B100 reacted with a protein of 50,000 daltons. These findings suggest that the mAB-B100 we have developed recognizes one of the many components of what appears to be an integrated cytoskeletal structure connected with intermediate filaments.
