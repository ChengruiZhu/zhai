M2 macrophages was domesticated by tumor microenvironment to produce some angiogenic molecules and protease, facilitating angiogenesis and matrix breakdown, promoting tumor invasive and metastasis. However, The function of M2 macrophages to progression of esophageal carcinoma, especially Kazakh esophageal carcinoma is still dimness. This study aims to investigate M2 macrophages correlated with matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) and microvessel density, and the role in the progression of Kazakh esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. CD163 and CD34 as the marker of M2 macrophages and endothelial cells, were used to identify the M2 macrophages density and microvessel density, respectively. Immunohistochemistry staining was evaluated the expression of MMP9. The number of infiltrated CD163-positive M2 macrophages in tumor islets and stroma was significantly higher than in cancer adjacent normal tissues. The increased of M2 macrophages and microvessel density were significantly correlated with more malignant phenotypes including lymph node metastasis and clinical stage progression. Meanwhile, the expression of MMP9 showed much higher level in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma than that in cancer adjacent normal tissues, and high expression of MMP9 in Kazakh esophageal squamous cell carcinoma was significantly associated with age, depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, and tumor clinical stage. The quantity of M2 macrophages in tumor stroma was positively associated with microvessel density and the expression of MMP9, and as an independent poorly prognostic factor for overall survival time of Kazakh esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. These findings suggest the increased number of M2 macrophages correlated with high expression of MMP9 and high microvessel density may contribute to the tumor aggressiveness and angiogenesis, promoting the progression of Kazakh esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
