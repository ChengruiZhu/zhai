We used quantitative reverse transcription (RT)/PCR to study the regulation of p75 mRNA and trkA mRNA expression in the developing sympathetic neurons of the mouse superior cervical sympathetic ganglion (SCG) in vivo and in vitro. At E13, the SCG contains proliferating cells that express many features of differentiated neurons. These immature neurons survived in culture without NGF, and NGF did not induce c-fos expression. Low levels of p75 and trkA mRNAs were expressed at this stage in vivo. There was no significant increase in the level of either trkA mRNA or p75 mRNA in E13 control cultures up to 72 h in vitro, and neither NGF nor depolarizing levels of K+ ions (40 mM KC1) affected the expression of trkA mRNA. In E14 cultures, NGF induced c-fos expression in 10-15% of the neurons and enhanced the survival of a similar percentage of neurons. The proportion of neurons responding to NGF increased with age, reaching 90% in E18 cultures. The in vivo level of trkA mRNA increased markedly from E14 onward, but in contrast to sensory neurons (in which p75 and trkA mRNA levels increase in parallel), the level of trkA mRNA initially increased far more rapidly than that of p75 mRNA. After E17, the level of p75 mRNA increased rapidly and approached that of trkA mRNA postnatally, but at no stage did this exceed the level of trkA mRNA. In E14 cultures, the level of trkA mRNA increased in the absence of neurotrophins or 40 mM KC1. The level of p75 mRNA in E14 cultures was enhanced by NGF but was unaffected by 40 mM KC1. Our findings show that NGF receptor expression during the earliest stages of sympathetic neuron development is not affected by depolarization but indicate that by an early developmental stage (between E13 and E14 in vivo), sympathetic neurons become specified to upregulate trkA mRNA in culture independently of added factors. In addition, our findings reveal several distinctive features of p75 mRNA and trkA mRNA expression in sympathetic neurons compared with sensory neurons and provide a plausible explanation for previously observed differences in the effects of a p75 null mutation on the response of sensory and sympathetic neurons during embryonic and postnatal development.
