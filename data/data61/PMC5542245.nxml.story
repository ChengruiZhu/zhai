Programmed death-1 (PD-1) is involved in the immune dysfunction of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study analyzed the association of circulating soluble PD-1 (sPD-1) levels with the phases and clinical diseases in chronic HBV infection. Serum sPD-1 levels were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay in patients with different phases and liver diseases of chronic HBV infection. The sPD-1 levels in patients with chronic HBV infection were significantly elevated compared with HBV infection resolvers or healthy controls. According to phases, sPD-1 level in immune-tolerant phase (IT) was significantly lower than in other phases. Multivariate analysis showed that sPD-1 was an independent factor associated with IT. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUC) showed that sPD-1 was significantly discriminative of IT from other phases with a cut-off of 1.535 ng/mL (AUC, 0.984; P<0.001). According to clinical diseases, sPD-1 level in HBV-related HCC was significantly higher than in other clinical diseases. Multivariate analysis showed that sPD-1 was an independent factor associated with HCC. The sPD-1 was significantly discriminative of HCC from other clinical diseases with a cut-off of 6.058 ng/mL (AUC, 0.962; P<0.001). The sPD-1 levels were significantly associated with HCC patientsâ€™ overall survival. HCC resection resulted in remarkable reduction in sPD-1 levels. These results demonstrate the involvement of sPD-1 in the disease course of chronic HBV infection and indicate the potential to apply sPD-1 as a biomarker for differentiating IT from other phases and HCC from other disease conditions in chronic HBV infection.
