Over 70 years ago, Barbara McClintock described telomeres and hypothesized about their role in protecting the integrity of chromosomes. Since then, scientists have shown that telomere length is highly regulated and associated with cell senescence and longevity, as well as with age-related disorders and cancer. Here, we show that despite their importance, the tight, highly complex regulation of telomeres may be disrupted by environmental cues, leading to changes in telomere length. We have introduced yeast cells to 13 different environmental stresses to show that some stresses directly alter telomere length. Our results indicate that alcohol and acetic acid elongate telomeres, while caffeine and high temperatures shorten telomeres. Using expression data, bioinformatics tools, and a large genetic screen, we explored the mechanisms responsible for the alterations of telomere length under several stress conditions. We identify Rap1 and Rif1, central players in telomere length maintenance, as the central proteins directly affected by external cues that respond by altering telomere length. Because many human diseases are related to alterations in telomere length that fuel the disease's pathology, controlling telomere length by manipulating simple stressing agents may point the way to effective treatment, and will supply scientists with an additional tool to study the machinery responsible for telomere length homeostasis.
