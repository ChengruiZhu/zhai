The nucleolus controls ribosome biogenesis and its perturbation induces nucleolar stress that inhibits cell cycle progression and activates checkpoint responses. Here, we investigate the roles of ribosomal RNA processing protein, RRP15, in nucleolar formation, ribosome biogenesis, cell cycle progression and checkpoint control in human cells. RRP15 is localized in the nucleolus and required for nucleolar formation. In contrast to the budding yeast Rrp15p that was reported as a component of pre-60S subunits, RRP15 is found in both pre-40S and pre-60S subunits and involved in regulating rRNA transcription and ribosome biogenesis. Perturbation of RRP15 induces nucleolar stress that activates RPL5/RPL11/5S rRNA (RP)-Mdm2-p53 axis checkpoint response and arrests cells at G1-G1/S in p53-proficient non-transformed RPE1 cells but not in p53-deficient HeLa and MCF7 tumor cells. Instead, p53-deficient HeLa and MCF7 cells with RRP15-dependent nucleolar stress enter S-phase with S-phase perturbation that activates ATR-Chk1- Î³H2AX axis DNA replication/damage checkpoint response, delaying S-G2/M progression and, ultimately, causing cell death. The selective checkpoint response, cell cycle inhibition and/or cytotoxicity induced by RRP15-dependent nucleolar stress in p53-proficient non-transformed cells and p53-deficient tumor cells suggest that RRP15 might be a potential target for cancer therapy.
