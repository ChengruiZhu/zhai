We collected 471 HCV risk assessment questionnaires during the eight-week period. The median age was 34 (range 18â€“71) and 403 (85.6%) were White British. Ten (2.1%) patients were known to be HCV positive, of which 3 were on treatment and 5 (1.1%) had cleared HCV. One hundred and forty-nine (31.6%) patients were HIV negative, 254 (53.9%) were HIV positive and 68 (14.5%) had unknown HIV status at time of clinic visit. In the last three months 151 (32.1%) reported unprotected receptive anal intercourse, 58 (12.3%) reported group sex, 11 (2.3%) reported receptive fisting and 32 (6.8%) reported more than 10 partners. Eighty-seven (18.5%) patients had shared notes/straws to snort drugs and 29 (6.2%) reported injecting drugs or slamming. One hundred and forty-two (30.0%) patients reported recreational drug use in the last 12 months, with cocaine, methadrone and ketamine most popular. One hundred and fifteen (24.4%) patients reported sex under the influence of recreational drugs. There were no statistical differences between HIV positive and HIV negative patients in their risk, sexual behaviour and drug use. STI screens were performed on 269 patients with nine (3.3%) new HIV diagnoses, four (1.5%) early syphilis, and 28 (10.4%) rectal gonorrhoea infections. There were three (1.1%) new HCV diagnoses, and one (33.3%) was in an HIV negative patient.
