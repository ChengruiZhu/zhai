While the aberrant expression and the controversial results of serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK1) have been reported in a number of malignancies, the expression of SGK1 and its possible association with the progression of adenocarcinoma in the esophagogastric junction (AEG) remain to be elucidated. To the best of our knowledge, the expression and localization of SGK1 was examined for the first time in the present study in cancerous and adjacent tissue from 60 patients with AEG, and compared with 20 healthy mucosa control tissue samples. Furthermore, the association between SGK1 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics, and prognosis of patients with AEG was statistically analyzed. The expression level of SGK1 was identified to be significantly higher (P<0.0001) in the cancerous AEG tissue samples (65%) compared with that of the adjacent tissue (31.7%) and healthy control (10%) samples. Enhanced SGK1 was primarily localized in the cytoplasm and the expression level of SGK1 was associated with the differentiation (P=0.045) and lymph node metastasis (P=0.006) of AEG. Notably, increased expression of SGK1 was demonstrated to be significantly correlated with poor overall survival (P=0.027). The results of the present study revealed the expression profile of SGK1 in AEG and demonstrated that SGK1 expression in cancerous tissue is an indicator for the progression of AEG. Thus, SGK1 may be a potential molecular marker for the diagnosis, interference therapy and prognosis of AEG.
