. Two milliliters of blood was collected from each bird via intravenous cannulae inserted into the wing vein. The blood samples were collected every 4 h over a 24-h period, starting from 09:00 h on the first day and completed at 09:00 h on the second day. The blood samples were analysed for erythrocyte, total and differential leucocyte counts. A trigonometric statistical model according to the single cosinor procedure was used to describe the periodic parameters and their acrophases, and ANOVA was used to determine significant differences. The results demonstrated the existence of daily rhythms in packed cell volume, haemoglobin, white blood cell, red blood cell, heterophil, lymphocyte, eosinophil and monocyte counts, while total protein displayed no rhythm. The characteristics of the haematological parameters showed that the acrophases were restricted to the light phase of the light/dark cycle, precisely at 09:00 h, except for eosinophil and heterophil counts, which had acrophases at 21:00 h. The amplitudes of the blood parameters varied, with packed cell volume having the greatest amplitude of 4.2 ± 0.5, closely followed by lymphocyte (3.4 ± 0.5) and heterophil (2.3 ± 0.2) counts. In conclusion, the results of the study demonstrated the existence of daily rhythms with diurnal acrophases in blood parameters of broiler chickens kept under natural photoperiods and tropical conditions.
