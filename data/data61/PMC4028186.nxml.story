GTPases commonly act as molecular switches in biological systems. By oscillating between two conformational states, depending on the type of guanine nucleotide bound (GTP or GDP), GTPases are essential regulators of many aspects of cell biology. Additional levels of regulation can be acquired through the synthesis of other guanine nucleotide derivatives that target GTPases; for instance, when nutrients are limited, bacterial cells produce guanine tetraphosphate/pentaphosphate—(p)ppGpp—as part of the “stringent response” to adjust the balance between growth and survival. ObgE is a GTPase with many reported cellular functions that include ribosome biogenesis, but none of its functions is understood at the molecular level. Here we characterize, both biochemically and structurally, the binding of ObgE to its cellular partner, the 50S ribosomal subunit. Our results show that ObgE is an anti-association factor, which binds to the 50S subunit to block the formation of the 70S ribosome, thereby inhibiting the initiation of translation. Furthermore, the binding and anti-association activities of ObgE are regulated by guanine nucleotides, as well as by (p)ppGpp. We thus propose that ObgE is a checkpoint protein in the assembly of the 50S subunit, which senses the cellular energy stress via levels of (p)ppGpp and links ribosome assembly to other global growth control pathways.
