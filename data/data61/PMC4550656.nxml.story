. The localization and density of white pigment cells in the mutant regenerating tail are similar to those of melanophores in the wild type regenerating tail. Here, white pigment cells in the mutant regenerating tail have been compared with melanophores in the wild type regenerating tail in the presence of phenylthiourea (PTU), which inhibits melanosome maturation in melanophores but does not affect reflecting platelet formation in white pigment cells. Ultrastructural analysis shows that reflecting platelet formation in white pigment cells is different from that in iridophores. Reflecting platelets in iridophores are formed from spherical vesicles with electron-dense material, whereas they are formed from stage II melanosomes characteristic of melanophore precursors in white pigment cells. Ultrastructural features of pigment organelles, except reflecting platelets, are similar between mutant melanophores and white pigment cells. In an attempt to identify specific genes in white pigment cells, a subtracted cDNA library enriched for mutant cDNAs has been prepared. Subtracted cDNA fragments have been cloned and selected by whole mount in situ hybridization. Among cDNA fragments examined so far, the ferritin H subunit gene is specifically expressed in white pigment cells, but not in melanophores. Pigment organellogenesis and specific gene expression in white pigment cells are also discussed.
