MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regulators of gene expression. Typically they recognize a binding site in genes' sequences and exert a repressive effect. This scheme prescribes a regulatory network that determines which gene is regulated by which miRNA. Yet this is a static sequence-based scheme that might not support dynamic changes in network wiring. Can genes become subject to, or be released, from the regulation of a miRNA in a manner that depends on the physiological state of cells? Here we describe such a dynamic mechanism. It is established that miRNA regulation is often more effective when their binding sites reside near the end of the target mRNA or right after the coding sequence STOP codon. Thus, a site distant from the mRNAâ€™s end might be latent as it will not bind efficiently its corresponding miRNA. Yet, in particular physiological states, e.g. cancer or rapidly proliferating cells, mRNA ends tend to become shortened. So far it was suggested that such shortening may serve to release proliferation-favoring genes from miRNA repression by eliminating their binding sites from the mRNA. We propose a mirror image, complementary mechanism that acts upon genes that need to be repressed during proliferation. Specifically, we propose that mRNA shortening can dynamically activate latent repressive miRNA binding sites by bringing the mRNA end close to them. We mapped the ends of all mRNAs in proliferating cells and found that cancer-enriched ends are strikingly positioned closely downstream to a high density of potentially latent binding sites, which are retained in the short mRNA but are now close to the new ends. This may enable such potentially latent miRNA sites to become dynamically activated upon proliferation. Remarkably, this mechanism targets preferentially pro-differentiation and antiproliferative genes, which are often repressed in cancer.
