The mechanistic Target Of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) is central to the cellular response to changes in nutrient signals such as amino acids. CASTOR1 is shown to be an arginine sensor, which plays an important role in the activation of the mTORC1 pathway. In the deficiency of arginine, CASTOR1 interacts with GATOR2, which together with GATOR1 and Rag GTPases controls the relocalization of mTORC1 to lysosomes. The binding of arginine to CASTOR1 disrupts its association with GATOR2 and hence activates the mTORC1 signaling. Here, we report the crystal structure of CASTOR1 in complex with arginine at 2.5 Å resolution. CASTOR1 comprises of four tandem ACT domains with an architecture resembling the C-terminal allosteric domains of aspartate kinases. ACT1 and ACT3 adopt the typical βαββαβ topology and function in dimerization via the conserved residues from helices α1 of ACT1 and α5 of ACT3; whereas ACT 2 and ACT4, both comprising of two non-sequential regions, assume the unusual ββαββα topology and contribute an arginine-binding pocket at the interface. The bound arginine makes a number of hydrogen-bonding interactions and extensive hydrophobic contacts with the surrounding residues of the binding pocket. The functional roles of the key residues are validated by mutagenesis and biochemical assays. Our structural and functional data together reveal the molecular basis for the arginine-binding specificity of CASTOR1 in the arginine-dependent activation of the mTORC1 signaling.
