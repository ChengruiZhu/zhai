The vomeronasal organ has an important role in mammal's social and sexual behaviours. In addition, it mediates defensive behavior through detection of protein pheromone homologues. In this work, a detailed morphological description of the postnatal development of the non-sensory epithelium (NSE) lining the vomeronasal duct (VND) of the female cat is provided using various histological techniques. The study focused on newborn, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks of postnatal ages using four animals for each age. We report here for the first time that three types of NSE line the rostral segment of the VND; nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium, stratified cuboidal epithelium, and ciliated pseudo stratified columnar ciliated epithelium with goblet cells and that the VND undergoes 90Â° a change in its its axis from the vertical position caudally to the horizontal position rostral. The NSE which lines the lateral side of the VND middle segment is consists of cliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium without goblet cells. In addition to basal cells, the NSE contains ciliated and three types of nonciliated columnar epithelial cells (dark, light, and unstained). Mitotic figures were observed only in the basal cells layer during the first 2 weeks of postnatal development. Intraepithelial invading inflammatory cells were uncommon. Scanning electron microscopy revealed unevenly distributed long cilia intermingled with microvillar processes and intervening short microvillar processes. These projecting cilia and microvilli revealed a gradual increase in their height during development toward maturity.
