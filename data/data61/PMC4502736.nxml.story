Sleep disorder is a common condition in the general population. Conventional sedative-hypnotic drug therapy may not be appropriate for many patients suffering from only mild-to-moderate sleep disorders. SurAsleep, a nutritional supplement that has been used by patients with sleep disorders in the United States, shows promising effects in improving sleep disorders and enhancing sleep quality. However, double-blinded, randomized and controlled studies have not been performed to determine the efficacy of the supplement. We conducted this study on individuals suffering from mild-to-moderate sleep disorders in Shanghai, China. In this study, we randomly assigned 100 participants over the age of 50 years old with symptoms of sleep disorders to a 12-week treatment with either SurAsleep or placebo. The results were measured by a self-administrated questionnaire on changes in symptoms, which covered 3 phases of sleep: the falling-asleep stage, the sleeping stage and the waking-up stage. We also measured the changes after the 12-week intervention using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), including 7 dimensions of sleeping. All symptoms, dimension-specific PSQI scores and total PSQI scores showed significant improvement after using SurAsleep. In this study, SurAsleep has shown potent effects in relieving somnipathy-related symptoms and improving sleep quality in sleep disorder patients.
