Myosin molecules are biological nanomachines that transduce chemical energy into mechanical work and thus produce directed motion in living cells. These molecules proceed through cyclic reactions in which they change their conformational states upon the binding and release of nucleotides while attaching to and detaching from filaments. The myosin family consists of many distinct members with diverse functions such as muscle contraction, cargo transport, cell migration, and sensory adaptation. How these functions emerge from the biophysical properties of the individual molecules is an open question. We present an approach that integrates recent findings from single-molecule experiments into a thermodynamically consistent description of myosin Ic and demonstrate how the specific parameter values of the cycle result in a distinct function. The free variables of our description are the chemical input and external force, both of which are experimentally accessible and define the cellular environment in which these proteins function. We use this description to predict the elastic properties of an ensemble of molecules and discuss the implications for myosin Icâ€™s function in the inner ear as a tension regulator mediating adaptation, a hallmark of biological sensory systems. In this situation myosin molecules cooperate in an intermediate regime, neither as a large ensemble as in muscle nor as a single or a few molecules as in intracellular transport.
