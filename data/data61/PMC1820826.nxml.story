Lymphoid cells recognize billions of pathogens as a result of gene rearrangements that generate pathogen-specific B- and T-cell receptors. This genetic reshuffling, called V(D)J recombination, occasionally misfires and damages genomic integrity. When such aberrations dysregulate proto-oncogenes, cancer ensues. It has become increasingly clear that multiple oncogenes acting in different cellular pathways can cooperate to cause cancer. Nevertheless, in the case of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, about a third of cases display oncogene activation in the absence of identified aberration, suggesting the presence of additional mechanisms of chromosomal alteration. In the hunt for such mechanisms, episomal circles (DNA segments that are excised during V(D)J recombination) have recently drawn attention. Moreover, signal joints, short sequences formed after gene rearrangements, once considered harmless, now appear to take part in events that might compromise genomic integrity. Using ex vivo recombination assays and genetically modified mice, we demonstrate that episomal circles may be reintegrated into the genome through recombination occurring between the episomal signal joints and a T-cell receptor target. Furthermore, we show that cryptic recombination sites located in the vicinity of oncogenes constitute hotspots of episomal insertion. Altogether, our results suggest that reintegration of excised episomal circles constitute a potential source of genomic instability and cancer in leukemia and lymphoma.
