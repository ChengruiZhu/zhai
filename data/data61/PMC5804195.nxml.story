Androgen-dependent male sexual traits (STs) as well as immunocompetence are theoretically assumed to be key indicators of a male’s quality for the mate-choosing female. We studied mate choice by sexually motivated (SM) females of Campbell’s dwarf hamsters. Females chose between 2 tethered male siblings that differed in expression of STs. Males were unrelated to the female and able to contact and copulate with her. In both males, we measured sex-related morphology of body mass, mid-ventral specific skin gland, ano-genital distance, and external testicular diameter. We also estimated levels of blood testosterone and cortisol, specific T- and B-cell immune responses to antigens, as well as aggressive and sexual dominance in sibling males through additional encounter experiments with another SM female (male sibs could freely compete for the female). We found that SM females chose a partner among 2 male sibs and spent over 80% of their time on average with the preferred male compared with the non-preferred one. Her choice was not associated with the first visit of the chosen male, with a higher expression of sex-related traits, higher levels of blood testosterone, or with aggressive dominance. The choice was not associated with the intensity of T-cell immune response to phitohemagglutinin (PHA). Instead there was a tendency for a negative relationship with the expression of STs and B-cell response to the antigen challenge. The only character that unambiguously influenced female choice was the non-aggressive male to female grooming during sexual contact. There was no difference in breeding success between preferred and non-preferred males paired with virgin females.
