Knowing transcription factors (TF) that regulate expression of differentially expressed genes is essential for understanding signaling cascades and regulatory mechanisms that lead to changes in gene expression. We developed methods for constructing gene-level scores (TREG binding scores) measuring likelihood that the gene is regulated based on the generative statistical model of ChIP-seq data for all genes (TREG binding profile). We also developed methods for integrating TREG binding scores with appropriately matched gene expression data to create TREG signatures of the TF activity. We then use TREG binding profiles and TREG signatures to identify TFs involved in the disease-related gene expression profiles. Two main findings of our study are: 1) TREG binding scores derived from ChIP-seq data are more informative than simple alternatives that can be used to summarize ChIP-seq data; and 2) TREG signatures that integrate the binding and gene expression data are more sensitive in detecting evidence of TF regulatory activity than commonly used alternatives. We show that this advantage of TREG signatures can make the difference between being able and not being able to infer TF regulatory activity in complex transcriptional profiles. This increased sensitivity was critically important in establishing connections between disease and drug signatures.
