The objective of this study was to investigate the mechanical properties of a low-shrinkage acrylate liquid crystalline resin matrix (ALCRM), (4-3-(acryloyloxy)-2-hydroxypropoxy) phenyl 4-(3-(acryloyloxy)-2-hydroxypropoxy) benzoate, combined with nano-hydroxyapatite (na-HA). The ALCRM monomer and diluent monomer triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) were mixed at a mass ratio of 7:3 to prepare the resin matrix. The volume shrinkage of the ALCRM/TEGDMA and the traditional resin matrix Bis-GMA (2, 2-bis [4-(3-methacryloxy-2-hydroxypropoxy) phenyl] propane)/TEGDMA were measured. Then 20%, 30%, and 40% na-HA were added to ALCRM/TEGDMA and Bis-GMA/TEGDMA, respectively. Compressive strength (CS) and Vickers hardness (VHN) were tested to identify mechanical properties of the composites. The volume shrinkage of the ALCRM/TEGDMA was 3.60% Â± 0.36%, which was lower than that of the traditional resin matrix. Moreover, with the same amount of na-HA filler, the mechanical properties of the ALCRM-based composites were superior to those of Bis-GMA-based composites. ALCRM-based composites exhibited the highest CS and VHN values when the filler content was 30%. These results indicate that the low-shrinkage liquid crystalline resin matrix has strong mechanical properties after incorporating the na-HA. The experimental ALCRM-based composites have promising potential for the development of novel low-shrinkage dental resins with strong mechanical properties.
