We have examined T cell recognition of a hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), pre-S(2)-region synthetic peptide, p120-145, in terms of fine specificity, H-2-linked genetic influences, comparison to antibody binding, and relevance to T cell recognition of the native protein. We showed that the immune response to the synthetic peptide is regulated by H-2-linked genes, but that the pattern of H-2 restriction differed from that observed for the native anti-pre-S(2) response. Dominant and nonoverlapping T cell and B cell recognition sites were identified on the synthetic peptide p120-145. T cell recognition is focussed on the NH2-terminal sequence, and antibody (B cell) recognition is focussed on the COOH-terminal sequence. The fine specificity of T cell recognition of p120-145 was defined by a single, subtype-dependent amino acid substitution. With respect to the immunogenicity of p120-145, the synthetic peptide containing both T and B cell determinants is highly immunogenic in responder strains, whereas separate T or B cell peptide determinants are minimally immunogenic. Furthermore, the synthetic T cell recognition site can prime T cell help for antibody production to the synthetic B cell site, which is crossreactive with the native pre- S(2) region of HBsAg/p33 particles. This system provides evidence that totally synthetic T cell and B cell recognition sites can be combined to yield a functional immunogen.
