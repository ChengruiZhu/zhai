Hematopoietic progenitors that give rise to mature blood cell types execute simultaneous programs of differentiation and proliferation. One well-established link between the cell cycle and differentiation programs takes place at the end of terminal differentiation, when cell cycle exit is brought about by the induction of cyclin -dependent kinase inhibitors. It is unknown, however, whether the cell cycle and differentiation programs are coordinated prior to cell cycle exit. Here, we identify a novel and unique link between the cell cycle clock and the erythroid (red blood cell) differentiation program that takes place several cell division cycles prior to cell cycle exit. It differs from the established link in several respects. First, it takes place at the onset, rather than at the end, of erythroid terminal differentiation, preceding the chromatin changes that enable induction of red cell genes. Second, it is initiated by the suppression, rather than the induction, of a cyclin -dependent kinase inhibitor. It therefore causes the cell to enter S-phase, rather than exit the cell cycle. Specifically, we found that there is an absolute interdependence between S-phase progression at this time in differentiation, and a key commitment step in which, within a short few hours, cells become dependent on the hormone erythropoietin, undergo activating changes in chromatin of red cell genes, and activate GATA-1, the erythroid master transcriptional regulator. Arresting S-phase progression at this time prevents execution of this commitment step and subsequent induction of red cell genes; conversely, arresting differentiation prevents S-phase progression. However, once cells have undergone this key commitment step, there is no longer an interdependence between S-phase progression and the induction of erythroid genes. We identified two regulators that control a “synchromesh” mechanism ensuring the precise locking of the cell cycle clock to the erythroid differentiation program during this key commitment step.
