Several sequence-based approaches exist to predict the epitope of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against HIV based on the correlation between variation in the viral sequence and neutralization response to the antibody. Though the potential epitope sites can be used to predict the neutralization response, the methods are not optimized for the task, using additional structural information, additional preselection steps to identify the epitope sites, and assuming independence and/or only linear relationship between the potential sites and the neutralization response. To model also the neutralization response to bNAbs with more complex binding sites, including for example several non-consecutive residues or accompanying conformational changes, we used non-linear, multivariate machine learning techniques. Though we used only the viral sequence information, the models learnt the corresponding binding sites of the bNAbs. In general only few residues were learnt to be responsible for a change in neutralization response, which can additionally reduce the sequencing cost for application in clinical routine. We propose our tailored models to aid the patient selection process for current clinical trials for bNAb immunotherapy, but also as a basis to predict the best combinations of bNAbs, which will be required for routine clinical practice in the future.
