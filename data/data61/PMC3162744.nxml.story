Robust advances in interactome analysis demand comprehensive, non-redundant and consistently annotated data sets. By non-redundant, we mean that the accounting of evidence for every interaction should be faithful: each independent experimental support is counted exactly once, no more, no less. While many interactions are shared among public repositories, none of them contains the complete known interactome for any model organism. In addition, the annotations of the same experimental result by different repositories often disagree. This brings up the issue of which annotation to keep while consolidating evidences that are the same. The iRefIndex database, including interactions from most popular repositories with a standardized protein nomenclature, represents a significant advance in all aspects, especially in comprehensiveness. However, iRefIndex aims to maintain all information/annotation from original sources and requires users to perform additional processing to fully achieve the aforementioned goals. Another issue has to do with protein complexes. Some databases represent experimentally observed complexes as interactions with more than two participants, while others expand them into binary interactions using spoke or matrix model. To avoid untested interaction information buildup, it is preferable to replace the expanded protein complexes, either from spoke or matrix models, with a flat list of complex members.
