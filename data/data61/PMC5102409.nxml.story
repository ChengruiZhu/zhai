Many microscale features in the human neocortex—a part of the brain involved in higher functions such as sensory perception, generation of motor commands, spatial reasoning, and language—are closely similar to those reported in experimental animals commonly used in neuroscience, like mice. However, the human neocortical neurons also exhibit specializations only reported in our species. One such feature is the capacity of excitatory principal cells to elicit firing in local inhibitory interneurons with a single action potential via very strong excitatory synapses. It has been suggested that this feature has specifically evolved to enhance coordinated firing of neuronal ensembles in higher brain functions. However, it is unknown how these circuits are modified by learning. Therefore, we investigated how these very strong excitatory synapses are changed, and if their impact on the firing of local inhibitory neurons is altered by repetitive action potentials mimicking learning-related activity. By recording in human neocortical slices, we report that the strong excitatory synapses on interneurons exhibit robust activity-dependent long-term plasticity. The plasticity also regulates the discharge of local interneurons driven by these synapses. Although these specialized synapses have only been reported in the human neocortex, their plasticity mechanism is evolutionarily conserved. We suggest that the strong synapses with robust plasticity have evolved to enhance complex brain functions and learning.
