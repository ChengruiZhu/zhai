Chromosomal rearrangements are a hallmark of genetic differences between species. But changes in chromosome structure can also occur spontaneously within species, within populations, or even within individuals. The causes and consequences of chromosomal rearrangements affecting natural populations are poorly understood. We investigated a class of fungal chromosomes called accessory chromosomes that are not shared among all individuals within a species. Using a fungal pathogen possessing numerous accessory chromosomes as a model, we assessed chromosome diversity based on whole-genome sequencing and a PCR assay of chromosomal segments that included a global collection of isolates. We show that the accessory chromosomes are highly variable in their gene content and that geographic differences correlate with the number and the structure of the chromosomes. We applied the same approach to document chromosomal rearrangements occurring during sexual reproduction. We identified viable offspring carrying a novel chromosome that originated from a large duplication affecting the majority of the chromosome. Our study showed that chromosomal structure can evolve rapidly within a species to generate a highly diverse set of accessory chromosomes. This chromosomal diversity may contribute significantly to the adaptive potential of fungal pathogens.
