The identification of a novel protein from Drosophila melanogaster that binds both mammalian epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin has been reported (Thompson, K. L., S. J. Decker, and M. R. Rosner, 1985, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., 82:8443-8447). This 100-kD protein (designated dp100) is also recognized by an antiserum against the human EGF receptor. To further characterize the properties of this protein, we have determined the binding spectrum, glycosylation state, and cellular distribution of dp100. Our results indicate that dp100 binds to other insulin-like and EGF-like growth factors with dissociation constants ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-9) M, and these ligands compete with each other for binding to dp100. All other ligands tested, including platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta, nerve growth factor, and glucagon, either did not bind or bound with a Kd greater than 10(-6) M. Unlike the Drosophila insulin receptor, dp100 does not bind to wheat germ agglutinin and is present in a cytoplasmic as well as a membrane-bound form that cannot be differentiated by two- dimensional PAGE. Further, dp100 is the sole transforming growth factor- alpha-binding protein detected by affinity labeling in Drosophila Kc cells. These results indicate that dp100 shares properties in common with, but distinct from, the Drosophila homologues of the insulin and EGF receptors.
