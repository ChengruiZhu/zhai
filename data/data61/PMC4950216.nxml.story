The subsolar magnetosheath is penetrated by transient enhancements in dynamic pressure. These enhancements, also called high‐speed jets, can propagate to the magnetopause, causing large‐amplitude yet localized boundary indentations on impact. Possible downstream consequences of these impacts are, e.g., local magnetopause reconnection, impulsive penetration of magnetosheath plasma into the magnetosphere, inner magnetospheric and boundary surface waves, drop outs and other variations in radiation belt electron populations, ionospheric flow enhancements, and magnetic field variations observed on the ground. Consequently, jets can be geoeffective. The extend of their geoeffectiveness is influenced by the amount of mass, momentum, and energy they transport, i.e., by how large they are. Their overall importance in the framework of solar wind‐magnetosphere coupling is determined by how often jets of geoeffective size hit the dayside magnetopause. In this paper, we calculate such jet impact rates for the first time. From a large data set of Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) multispacecraft jet observations, we find distributions of scale sizes perpendicular and parallel to the direction of jet propagation. They are well modeled by an exponential function with characteristic scales of 1.34
