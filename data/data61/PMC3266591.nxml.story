Radiofrequency-assisted intact specimen biopsy (RFIB) has been introduced for percutaneous biopsy or removal of breast tumors. Using radiofrequency cutting, the system enables the radiologist to obtain an intact sample of the target lesion. According to the IDEAL recommendations, we performed a critical evaluation of our initial experience with RFIB. Between June and November 2010, radiography-guided RFIB was performed in 19 female patients. All patients presented with suspicious microcalcifications (BI-RADS III-V) on mammography. Biopsy specimen integrity, thermal damage and histologic diagnosis were assessed by an expert breast pathologist. Data on technical success, diagnostic and therapeutic accuracy and periprocedural complications were collected and analyzed. The median age of the patients was 59 years. Median lesion diameter on mammography was 8 mm (range 2–76 mm). The procedure was successful in 16/19 (84%) patients and unsuccessful in 3/19 (16%) patients (2 non-representative samples, 1 sample with extensive thermal damage). Histologic analysis of the RFIB specimen revealed 12/19 (63%) benign lesions and 7/19 (37%) malignancies (4 ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) lesions and 3 invasive ductal carcinomas). In 1 patient, a DCIS lesion was completely removed with RFIB. Overall, 3 periprocedural complications occurred (1 wound leakage, 1 arterial hemorrhage and 1 infection requiring oral antibiotics). Tissue sampling of suspicious breast lesions can be performed successfully with RFIB. In 1 patient DCIS was radically excised with RFIB, which illustrates its potential as a minimally invasive therapeutic procedure for removal of small breast tumors. This is an interesting focus for further research when larger probe sizes become available.
