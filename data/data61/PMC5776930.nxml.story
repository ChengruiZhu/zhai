The aim of the present study was to identify genes, microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) or pathways associated with the development of pituitary gonadotroph adenomas. The array data of GSE23207, which included 16 samples of multiple endocrine neoplasia-associated rat pituitary homozygous mutations and 5 pituitary tissue samples from healthy rats, were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed prior to functional enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction. miRNAs associated with DEGs were predicted, and an miRNA-target regulatory network was constructed. A total of 187 upregulated and 370 downregulated DEGs were identified in the pituitary gonadotroph adenoma group compared with the healthy (control) group. Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) 1 exhibited the highest degree in the PPI network. The upregulated DEGs were predominately enriched in ‘neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction’ pathway, and downregulated DEGs were mainly enriched in ‘cell cycle’. The DEGs in module were predominately enriched in the ‘cell cycle’, whereas DEGs in module b and c were enriched in ‘neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction’. miR-374, −153, −145 and −33 were identified as important miRNAs in the regulation of the DEGs. Cdk1, cyclin (Ccn) A2, Ccnb1, ‘cell cycle’ and ‘neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction’ pathways may serve important roles in the development of pituitary gonadotroph adenomas; Ccna2 and Ccnb1 may contribute to this development via an effect on the ‘cell cycle’ pathway. Furthermore, miR-374 and −145 may contribute to the development of pituitary gonadotroph adenomas via regulation of the expression of target genes.
