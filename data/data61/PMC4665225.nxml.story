The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (BMI-1) in vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC) and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN). Furthermore, the present study investigated the effects of BMI-1 expression on the biological behavior of A-431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells. BMI-1 expression in human VSCC and VIN tissues was detected using immunohistochemistry. Subsequently, BMI-1 expression was silenced in A-431 cells using small interfering RNA (siRNA), and BMI-1 expression was detected using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The effects of BMI-1 silencing on cell proliferation, apoptosis and invasive ability were determined using an MTT assay, Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide double-labeling experiment and Transwell assay, respectively. The expression rate of BMI-1 in normal vulvar, VIN and VSCC tissues was 0.0, 25.0 and 68.0% respectively, demonstrating an increasing trend in the severity of the disease. BMI-1 overexpression was found not to correlate with age, pathological stage, lymph node metastasis or degree of differentiation (P>0.05). BMI-1 siRNA transfection effectively inhibited BMI-1 messenger RNA and protein expression in A-431 cells. The mean rate of apoptosis promotion and proliferation inhibition in the most effectively silenced group were 20.19 and 46.82%, respectively, which was significantly higher than that of the cells in the blank and control siRNA groups (P<0.05). The number of invading cells was decreased in the most effectively silenced group compared with that of the blank and control siRNA groups. Abnormal expression of BMI-1 was also detected in VIN and VSCC tissues, and targeting of BMI-1 with siRNA was able to successfully silence BMI-1 expression in A-431 cells. Silencing of BMI-1 promoted apoptosis and inhibited the invasive abilities of A-431 cells in vitro.
