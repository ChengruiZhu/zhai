Bangladesh has achieved a considerable decline in fertility level in the past four decades through a strong family planning programme in spite of its poor social and economic growth. However, discontinuation of contraceptive methods and decline in the use of long-acting and permanent methods (LAPMs) are still the major concerns of the family planning programmes. This paper describes various factors that lead to the acceptance of the long-term method—Norplant and those that lead to early discontinuation. This descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted in the Family Planning Association of Bangladesh (FPAB), Dinajpur, during March–June 2005 among 73 women who visited the clinic to remove their Norplant before its usual duration (5 years). The women were in the 25-31 years age-group—around two-thirds of them (57.5%) without formal education, and three-fourths of them (75.3%) were housewives. Most of them had been married for nine years, on average, and had two and/or more children. Sixty-seven percent of the women experienced regular menstruation, and 95% had used other contraceptive methods prior to using Norplant. Past users of Norplant were the single-most important source of information for about three-fourths of the women (74%); half of the women (51%) had discussed the method with their husbands, and majority (96%) of the husbands were informed about the women's decision on accepting the method before its implantation. All women were aware about the usual length of the effectiveness of Norplant. The most common reason for early removal of Norplant was menstrual disorder (59%), followed by desire for children (16%), husband's death, for abandonment or residing abroad (8%), anorexia, nausea, vomiting (7%), weight gain (4%), husband's objection (3%), and religious beliefs (3%). Service providers should properly counsel the couple before providing any contraceptive method, informing them about method-related side-effects and clearing any religious misconceptions. They should also explore the perception of women as well as their partners’ desire for children; couples who would like to have a baby within a year or two can be encouraged to use a short-term method that can be more easily discontinued.
