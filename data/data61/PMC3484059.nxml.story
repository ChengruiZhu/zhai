The mechanism that determines body length is unknown but likely operates at the elongating tail end of vertebrate embryos. In the early embryo, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling maintains a proliferative pool of cells in the tailbud that progressively generates the body. It also protects these cells from the differentiating influence of retinoic acid, which is produced by the maturing mesoderm tissues of the extending body. We show here, in the chick embryo, that the “endgame”—that is, the termination of body axis elongation—comes when the mesodermal gene brachyury is suddenly lost from axial stem cell population and presumptive mesoderm cells in the tailbud late in development. Using gain- and loss-of-function approaches, we demonstrate that this step is mediated by loss of FGF signalling. We present evidence that this is due to rising retinoid signalling in the tailbud and that FGF signalling in the tailbud no longer opposes retinoid synthesis and activity. Finally, we reveal that these events are followed by local cell death in the tailbud, which can be reduced by the attenuation of retinoid signalling but involves a mechanism that is independent of FGF signalling via its usual receptor. We propose that cessation of body elongation involves loss of FGF-dependent mesoderm identity in the late tailbud and that this is mediated by rising endogenous retinoid activity, which ultimately promotes cell death in the chick tailbud.
