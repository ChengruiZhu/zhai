As antifungal agents are frequently used in hematology and oncology, economic data on the empirical therapy of suspected systemic fungal infection are pivotal. Data were analyzed according to: (1) the rate of nephrotoxicity related to treatment with caspofungin in comparison to liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) from a randomized clinical trial, (2) the effect of nephrotoxicity on length of hospital stay from a European observational study, and (3) an example of total bottom-up cost in a department of hematology in Germany. All estimates include 95% confidence intervals (CI) using two-stage Monte Carlo simulation on binominal and Gaussian random variables from separate studies with comparable populations. Overall, 8.9 (95% CI 5.9–12.1) fewer patients (of 100 randomized) experienced worsening of renal function with caspofungin vs L-AmB, giving a number needed to treat for one patient to be harmed by L-AmB of 12 (95% CI 8–17). This was estimated to translate into 5.3 extra days in hospital (95% CI 1.6–9.1) per event or 0.48 days (95% CI 0.14–0.88) worth €298 (95% CI 89–554) per patient receiving L-AmB rather than caspofungin. From the hospital perspective, use of caspofungin was estimated to be cost-neutral compared to L-AmB at a per diem total hospital cost of €428 with, and €1284 without, consideration of supplementary reimbursement (Zusatzentgelt) of both L-AmB and caspofungin. The data presented in this scenario show that use of caspofungin in hematology–oncology departments in Germany results in shorter hospital stays and is at least cost-neutral compared to use of L-AmB.
