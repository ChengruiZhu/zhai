Chromosome segregation errors during meiosis may cause infertility, fetal loss, or birth defects. To avoid meiotic chromosome segregation errors, recombination-mediated linkages are established between previously unattached homologous chromosomes. Such recombination events initiate with breaks in the DNA, but how these breaks are preferentially repaired using the distal homologous chromosome, rather than the physically more proximal sister chromatid of similar sequence, is not well understood. Meiotic repair-template bias in the budding yeast depends on the function of Mek1, a meiosis-specific protein kinase. Previous models suggested that Mek1 activity creates repair-template bias by suppressing repair with the sister chromatid. We found that Mek1 localizes on meiotic chromosomes until the homologues pair and closely align. Removal of Mek1 requires the assembly of a conserved zipper-like structure between meiotic chromosomes, known as the synaptonemal complex. DNA break repair is delayed in mutants in which Mek1 persists on closely aligned homologues. These findings suggest that persistent Mek1 activity can suppress repair from all templates, and that one function of the synaptonemal complex is to remove this activity from chromosomes. Our findings build on previous models to propose that Mek1 activity creates a local zone of repair suppression that is normally avoided by the spatially distant homologous chromosome to promote repair-template bias.
