 after cessation of the pyrexia; the effect is not so marked. Some cases, however, showed a variation in excess of the normal as if there was not yet complete return to normal. See PDF for Structure Biologically these changes are of importance in that this shifting of the dissociation curve to the right in fever means that there is more oxygen available for the tissues than normally, more especially at higher pressures. The tension of unloading is raised. This, in addition to the accelerated circulation and the probable increased velocity o[ reaction, means that even in a localized area of inflammation, if there is increased temperature, the tissues are placed in a better position for resisting infection as a result of their better oxygenation. That there is increased metabolism during fever has been conclusively shown by Du Bois (20) and others using large bed calorimeters. Du Bois has shown that the increase in metabolism obeys van't Hoff's law, increasing 13 per cent for each 1Â°C. rise. This shifting of the curve then falls into line with these observations as an adaptive response to the febrile condition, and the febrile temperature, if not too great, would seem to be a purposive attempt to aid the combating of infection. This shifting of the curve probably explains Uyeno's (21) observation on the effect of increased temperature on the circulation in the cat; namely, increased coefficient of utilization, and increased fall in the saturation of the mixed venous blood. Turning now to Table II, we find that, if the CO
