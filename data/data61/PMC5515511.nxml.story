The development of quantitative imaging biomarkers in medicine requires automatic delineation of relevant anatomical structures using available imaging data. However, this task is complicated in clinical medicine due to the variation in scanning parameters and protocols, even within a single medical center. Existing literature on automatic image segmentation using MR data is based on the analysis of highly homogenous images obtained using a fixed set of pulse sequence parameters (TR/TE). Unfortunately, algorithms that operate on fixed scanning parameters do not avail themselves to real-world daily clinical use due to the existing variation in scanning parameters and protocols. Thus, it is necessary to develop algorithmic techniques that can address the challenge of MR image segmentation using real clinical data. Toward this goal, we developed a multi-parametric ensemble learning technique to automatically detect and segment lumbar vertebral bodies using MR images of the spine. We use spine imaging data to illustrate our techniques since low back pain is an extremely common condition and a typical spine clinic evaluates patients that have been referred with a wide range of scanning parameters. This method was designed with special emphasis on robustness so that it can perform well despite the inherent variation in scanning protocols. Specifically, we show how a single multi-parameter ensemble model trained with manually labeled T2 scans can autonomously segment vertebral bodies on scans with echo times varying between 24 and 147 ms and relaxation times varying between 1500 and 7810 ms. Furthermore, even though the model was trained using T2-MR imaging data, it can accurately segment vertebral bodies on T1-MR and CT, further demonstrating the robustness and versatility of our methodology. We believe that robust segmentation techniques, such as the one presented here, are necessary for translating computer assisted diagnosis into everyday clinical practice.
