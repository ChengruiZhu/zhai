The central nervous system is continuously adapting to a wide variety of input signals. Single neurons receive from one to thousands of input signals and need mechanisms to prevent their output activity from locking up in quiescence or saturation. One experimentally observed mechanism is homeostatic scaling of neuronal excitability (HSE), which adapts neuronal responsiveness at the time scale of minutes. Most neurons function in networks of excitatory and inhibitory cells. Maintaining stability of activity in such networks is highly relevant, because deviations can result in pathologies like epilepsy. Can HSE control output activity of single neurons without interfering with network stability? To address this question we implement HSE in a neuronal network model. We show that stable functioning of HSE requires that the adaptation rate of the inhibitory cells is slower than that of the excitatory cells. We subsequently investigate various changes in network organization that demand adaptation by HSE, showing that HSE can successfully control activity levels as long as feedback excitation is not stronger than feedback inhibition. This suggests that maintaining stable, functional networks requires the coordination of distinct homeostatic mechanisms, acting not only through adjustments of single cell responsiveness, but also by controlling network connectivity.
