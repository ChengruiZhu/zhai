A systematic review will be conducted using Cochrane library, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsychINFO. Research registrars and bibliographies of included articles will be screened, and experts will be contacted. The search strategy consists of terms related to eating disorders, motivation, and outcome. Randomized controlled trials, clinical controlled trials, time series, and before-after studies will be included. Participants will be adolescents and adults who are diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder or OSFED and who are entering psychotherapy treatment. The predictor studied is defined as motivation for change at the beginning of treatment. The primary outcome will be an overall change in eating-disorder symptomatology at the end of treatment and at less than, and over 6-month follow-up. Other outcomes of interest include change in restricting, binging, and compensatory behaviours, change in shape, weight and eating concerns, change in psychiatric comorbidities, weight restoration, and dropout rates. Articles will be selected, data will be extracted, and the risk of bias will be assessed by independent reviewers using forms pre-created on Eppi-Reviewer 4 software. Results will be combined using a random-effects model. Studies of all sizes and qualities will be included in the analyses. Heterogeneity will be examined by funnel plot, Cochranâ€™s Q, and I
