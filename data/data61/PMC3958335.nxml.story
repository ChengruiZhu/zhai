Humans and animals face the constant challenge of identifying the subset of incoming sensory stimuli that are most behaviorally relevant and prioritizing behavioral responses accordingly. Critical to this decision is the ability to determine whether a stimulus is motivationally salient—that is, whether the stimulus predicts important behavioral outcomes such as reward or punishment. While it is generally assumed that motivational salience is related to faster decision speed and shorter reaction time, it remains unclear how motivational salience actually modulates the decision-making process. This study investigates how the motivational salience signal in the basal forebrain controls the fundamental properties of the decision-making process—decision speed and its variability. In rats performing a reward-biased simple reaction time task, we show that the basal forebrain motivational salience signal is associated with a faster and also precise decision speed. In support of a causal role for this association, artificially augmenting this basal forebrain motivational salience signal by electrical stimulation also leads to faster and more precise reaction times. These results suggest that decision speed and its variability are jointly determined by an early and previously unrecognized step in the decision-making process, dictated largely by the motivational salience signal encoded by poorly understood noncholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain.
