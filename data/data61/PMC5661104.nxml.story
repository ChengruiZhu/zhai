SH3GL2 (Src homology 3 (SH3) domain GRB2‐like 2) is mainly expressed in the central nervous system and regarded as a tumour suppressor in human glioma. However, the molecular mechanism of the SH3GL2 protein involved in malignant behaviours of human glioma has not been elucidated. In this study, we tried to investigate the role of SH3GL2 in glioma cell migration and invasion and explore its underlined molecular mechanism. Firstly, we discovered that the protein level of SH3GL2 was widely decreased in the human glioma patients, especially in high‐grade glioma tissues. Then, we determined the role of SH3GL2 in migration and invasion of glioma cells upon SH3GL2 knocking down and overexpressing. It was showed that knocking down of SH3GL2 promoted the migration and invasion of glioma cells, whereas overexpression of SH3GL2 inhibited them. Further study on molecular mechanism disclosed that silencing of SH3GL2 obviously activated the STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) signalling thereby promoting the expression and secretion of MMP2. On the contrary, overexpression of SH3GL2 had opposite effect. Taken together, the above results suggest that SH3GL2 suppresses migration and invasion behaviours of glioma cells through negatively regulating STAT3/MMP2 signalling and that loss of SH3GL2 may intensify the STAT3/MMP2 signalling thereby contributing to the migration and invasion of glioma cells.
