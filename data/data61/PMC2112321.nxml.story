Populations of Chinese hamster ovary cells selected for resistance to diphtheria toxin were found to be highly enriched for mutants deficient in the uptake of lysosomal hydrolases via the mannose 6-phosphate receptor. One doubly defective mutant, DTF 1-5-1, exhibited increased resistance to Sindbis virus, although it was able to bind and internalize virus normally. Normal production of virus was obtained when, subsequent to virus binding, the mutant was exposed for 2 min to acidic pH. Similarly, a shift to acidic pH increased the sensitivity of DTF 1-5-1 to diphtheria toxin 12-fold. Decreased uptake of lysosomal hydrolases by the mutant correlated with decreased mannose 6-phosphate receptor activity at the cell surface; results of lactoperoxidase- catalyzed iodination indicated that the surface-associated receptor was present but inactive on DTF 1-5-1. Total mannose 6-phosphate receptor activity was also decreased in the mutant and this decrease was reflected by increased secretion of lysosomal hydrolases. The phenotype of DTF 1-5-1 resembles in many ways that of cells treated with ammonia. We suggest that the defect in DTF 1-5-1 stems from an inability to deliver virus, diphtheria toxin, and lysosomal hydrolases to an acidic compartment. Other ligands may be endocytosed through a different pathway since the defect of DTF 1-5-1 did not decrease the endocytosis of ricin, modeccin, or Pseudomonas toxin and had minimal effects on uptake and degradation of low density lipoprotein.
