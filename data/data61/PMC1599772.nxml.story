Studies of differences between the chimpanzee and human genomes have focused on protein-coding genes. However, examples of amino acid changes between chimp and human have not been able to explain most of the phenotypic differences between us and our fellow hominoids. King and Wilson (1975) proposed that the main differences between chimps and humans will be found in non-coding regulatory DNA. Consistent with this hypothesis, recent whole-genome scans for evolutionarily conserved DNA elements that have evolved rapidly since our divergence from the chimp-human ancestor have discovered largely non-coding regions. The authors investigate a carefully screened set of 202 such human accelerated regions (HARs). Most of these HARs do not code for proteins, but instead are located in introns and intergenic regions near protein-coding genes. The set of genes near HARs is enriched for transcription factors, suggesting that the HARs may play important roles in gene regulation. This study also discovers a striking adenine and thymine to guanine and cytosine bias among the human-specific changes in HARs. This suggests the involvement of biased gene conversion or a selective force to increase guanine and cytosine content. Some HARs may also have been under positive selection. Hence, there is likely more than one evolutionary force shaping the fastest evolving regions of the human genome.
