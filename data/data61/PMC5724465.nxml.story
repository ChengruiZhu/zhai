Conventional methods of treating superficial head and neck tumors, such as the wedge pair technique or the use of multiple electron fields of varying energies, can result in excellent tumor control. However, in some cases, these techniques irradiate healthy tissue unnecessarily and/or create hot and cold spots injunction regions, particularly in patients with complex surface contour modification or varying planning target volume (PTV) thickness. The objective of this work is to demonstrate how bolus electron conformal therapy can be used for these patients. Two patients treated using this technique are presented. The first patient was diagnosed with malignant fibrous histiocytoma involving the right ear concha and was treated with 12‐MeV electrons. The second patient was diagnosed with acinic cell carcinoma of the left parotid gland and was treated with 20‐MeV electrons after having undergone a complete parotidectomy. Each patient's bolus was designed using bolus design tools implemented in an in‐house treatment‐planning system (TPS). The bolus was fabricated using a computer‐controlled milling machine. As part of the quality assurance process to ensure proper fabrication and placement of the bolus, the patients underwent a second computed tomography (CT) scan with the bolus in place. Using that data, the final dose distribution was computed using the Philips Pinnacle
