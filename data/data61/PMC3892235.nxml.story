Objective: Dentinal hypersensitivity is a commonly encountered problem with varied treatment options for its management. A large number of home use products have been tested and used for the management of dentinal hypersensitivity. This 8 week clinical trial investigates the temporal efficacy of commercially available calcium sodium phosphosilicate containing toothpaste in comparison to a potassium nitrate containing toothpaste.
Methods: A total 20 subjects between the ages of 18 to 65 years were screened for a visual analogue score (VAS) for sensitivity of 5 or more by testing with a cold stimulus and randomly divided into test and positive control groups. Baseline sensitivity VAS scores to air evaporative stimulus were recorded for minimum two teeth. The subjects were prescribed respective dentifrices and revaluated for sensitivity scores at 2, 4 and 8 weeks.
Results:The study demonstrated reduction in symptoms for all treatment groups from baseline to 2, 4 and 8 weeks. The calcium sodium phosphosilicate group showed a higher degree of effectiveness at reducing hypersensitivity to air evaporative stimulus at 2 weeks, than commercially available potassium nitrate. However, there was no significant difference in scores of subjects using the calcium sodium phosphosilicate toothpaste as compared to potassium nitrate at 4 weeks and 8 weeks. 
Conclusion: Calcium sodium phosphosilicate showed greater reduction in sensitivity compared to potassium nitrate at an earlier stage which is of high clinical value. However, based on the findings of the present study long term effects of calcium sodium phosphosilicate seem to be less promising than previously claimed.
