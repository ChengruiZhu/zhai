) in the budding yeast, where it was shown to extend yeast lifespan. Seven mammalian sirtuins (SIRT1-7) have been now identified with distinct subcellular localization, enzymatic activities and substrates. These enzymes regulate cellular processes such as metabolism, cell survival, differentiation, DNA repair and they are implicated in the pathogenesis of solid tumors and leukemias. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of sirtuin expression, activity and inhibition in the survival of pediatric sarcoma cell lines.We have analyzed the expression of SIRT1 and SIRT2 in a series of pediatric sarcoma tumor cell lines and normal cells, and we have evaluated the activity of the sirtuin inhibitor and p53 activator tenovin-6 (Tv6) in synovial sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines. We show that SIRT1 is overexpressed in synovial sarcoma biopsies and cell lines in comparison with normal mesenchymal cells. Tv6 induced apoptosis as well as impaired autophagy flux. Using siRNA to knock down SIRT1 and SIRT2, we show that the expression of both proteins is crucial for the survival of rhabdomyosarcoma cells and that the loss of SIRT1 expression results in a decreased LC3II expression. Our results show that SIRT1 and SIRT2 expressions are crucial for the survival of synovial sarcomas and rhabdomyosarcomas, and demonstrate that the pharmacological inhibition of sirtuins impairs the autophagy process and induces tumor cell death.
