Viruses pose a continuous threat to human health, even though our immune systems have evolved to neutralize invading viruses. As part of the innate immune system, the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) are essential for detecting viruses during infection. Recognition of viral RNA by the RLRs triggers an antiviral response that inhibits viral replication, protects uninfected cells, and attracts specialized immune cells. Better understanding of the innate antiviral response may reveal novel targets for antiviral therapeutics and vaccine development. However, that requires knowledge about which genes and proteins are involved. In the present study, we systematically investigated the wealth of available genomics data (including gene expression, protein interactions, transcription regulation and genome sequences) and discovered no less than 10 distinctive properties of genes known to be part of the antiviral RLR pathway. By combining these properties in a statistical framework, we predicted 187 novel RLR pathway components. Our validation experiments showed that ~50% of the predicted candidate genes have a significant effect on antiviral signaling. These results, together with independent computational and literature-based confirmation, demonstrated the validity of our combined bioinformatics and experimental approach. Our study expands the collection of known antiviral genes, opening up new avenues for research into innate antiviral immunity.
