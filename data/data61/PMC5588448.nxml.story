Histological features of colorectal lesions are currently evaluated via a magnifying chromoendoscopy [pit pattern (PIT) classification]. Advanced histological features are rarely observed in diminutive (â‰¤5 mm) adenomatous polyps (DAPs). The Japanese guidelines indicate that diminutive neoplastic lesions without carcinomatous findings may be left untreated and followed up. At the present institution, DAPs with type IIIL PIT are left untreated in various cases, whereas lesions with type III, IV or V PIT are typically resected via routine colonoscopy. This retrospective study aimed to assess the management of DAPs using PIT classification. The participants of the study included patients <30 years previously referred for an initial colonoscopy, then reobserved for <3 years following the procedure. Participants were classified into three groups: Group A, Patients with type IIIL PIT DAP left untreated (semi-clean colon group); group B, patients with all neoplastic polyps, including DAPs, resected (clean colon group); and group C, patients without any adenomatous polyps (internal control group). The cumulative incidence of the index lesions (ILs) at the follow-up colonoscopy was analysed among the three groups. A total of 4,313 patients were enrolled in the study, with categorization as follows: Group A, 1,246; group B, 1,205; and group C, 1,862 patients. ILs were detected in group A, 100 (8.0%); group B, 104 (8.6%); and group C, 29 (1.6%) patients. There was no significant difference observed between groups A and B. It was verified that removing the type IIIL PIT DAPs did not decrease the incidence of ILs within a 3-year time period. Therefore, these polyps may be left untreated in combination with patient reobservation at an appropriate time interval, potentially one equal to that suggested following a polypectomy.
