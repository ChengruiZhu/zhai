Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is an indispensable part of the cell death program. During phagocytosis, the evolutionarily conserved CED-1 family phagocytic receptors recognize cell corpses and transduce engulfment signals to induce the formation and maturation of phagosomes. However, it remains largely unknown how the CED-1 signaling pathway induces the cytoskeletal reorganization required for corpse internalization and initiates phagosome maturation. Interestingly, cell corpse phagocytosis appears to resemble clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) of cell surface molecules in that both events cause receptor-dependent internalization of extracellular cargoes differing only in size. In CME, the recognition of plasma membrane receptors by adaptor proteins such as the AP2 complex triggers the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) with diameters ranging from 10â€“200 nm. Nevertheless, it is not known whether clathrin and AP2 also play a role in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells that are much larger than CCVs. Here we provide genetic, cell biological, and biochemical experimental findings to demonstrate that clathrin and AP2 act downstream of CED-1 to regulate the actin cytoskeleton rearrangement required for cell corpse internalization and cell corpse degradation. Clathrin and AP2 form two types of complex with factors required for engulfment and phagosome maturation. These findings establish clathrin and AP2 as essential players in phagocytic receptor-mediated apoptotic cell clearance.
