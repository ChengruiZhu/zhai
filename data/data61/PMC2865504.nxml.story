The Guanine plus Cytosine (GC) content of bacterial genomes varies from 20% to 80%. This variation is attributed to the mutation bias produced by replication and repair machinaries. However, the evolutionary forces that act on these very different machinaries have remained elusive. It is known that the GC content of genes strongly influences the resulting proteins' hydrophobicity, which is the main determinant of folding stability. This may lead to expectation that the GC content is strongly selected at its optimal value, since proteins that are too hydrophylic face unfolding problems and proteins that are too hydrophobic face misfolding and aggregation problems. In this work, using a realistic model of genotype (DNA sequence) to phenotype (protein folding stability) to fitness mapping and a standard population genetics model, we find that the optimal GC usage depends on population size. In particular, very small populations prefer small GC usage, intermediate populations prefer large GC usage, and large populations prefer no bias. Our results may explain why most intracellular bacteria, evolving with small effective populations, tend to adopt small GC usage. To test this hypothesis, we estimated the effective population size of several bacterial species, finding that those that evolve with 50% GC usage are characterized by significantly larger populations, although several exceptions exist.
