The subcellular distribution of phospholamban in adult canine ventricular myocardial cells was determined by the indirect immunogold- labeling technique. The results presented suggest that phospholamban, like the Ca2+-ATPase, is uniformly distributed in the network sarcoplasmic reticulum but absent from the junctional portion of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum. Unlike the Ca2+-ATPase, but like cardiac calsequestrin, phospholamban also appears to be present in the corbular sarcoplasmic reticulum. Comparison of the relative distribution of phospholamban immunolabeling in the sarcoplasmic reticulum with that of the sarcolemma showed that the density of phospholamban in the network sarcoplasmic reticulum was approximately 35-fold higher than that of the cytoplasmic side of the sarcolemma, which in turn was found to be three- to fourfold higher than the density of the background labeling. However, a majority of the specific phospholamban labeling within 30 nm of the cytoplasmic side of the sarcolemma was clustered and present over the sarcoplasmic reticulum in the subsarcolemmal region of the myocardial cells, suggesting that phospholamban is confined to the junctional regions between the sarcolemma and the sarcoplasmic reticulum, but absent from the nonjunctional portion of the sarcolemma. Although the resolution of the immunogold-labeling technique used (60 nm) does not permit one to determine whether the specific labeling within 30 nm of the cytoplasmic side of the sarcolemma is associated with the sarcolemma and/or the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum, it is likely that the low amount of labeling in this region represents phospholamban associated with sarcoplasmic reticulum. These results suggest that phospholamban is absent from the sarcolemma and confined to the sarcoplasmic reticulum in cardiac muscle.
