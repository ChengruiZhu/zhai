The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of short-term high fat feeding on the inflammatory response in polymicrobial sepsis. Male C57BL/6 mice at six-weeks of age were randomized to a high-fat diet (HFD) (60% kcal fat) or control diet (CD) (16% kcal fat) for 3 weeks. After 3 weeks of feeding, sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and animals were monitored for survival. In a separate experiment, after 3 weeks of feeding mice underwent CLP and were sacrificed at various time-points thereafter. Tissue was collected for biochemical studies. Mice fed a HFD gained more weight and had a greater fat mass compared to CD-fed mice. Mice on a HFD had a lower probability of survival and more severe lung injury compared with CD-fed mice following sepsis. Myeloperoxidase activity, an indicator of neutrophil infiltration, was increased in the lung and liver after CLP in HFD-fed mice compared with CD (p<0.05). The plasma cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and interleukin (IL)-6 were increased in both groups after CLP, however TNFα and IL-6 levels were lower in HFD mice at 3h after CLP compared with CD and consistent with lung, but not liver, mRNA expression. Leptin levels were higher in HFD-fed mice at 18h after sepsis compared to baseline levels (p<0.05). Polymicrobial sepsis increased hepatic nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation in HFD-fed mice after CLP vs. CD-fed mice. Short duration high fat feeding increases mortality and organ injury following polymicrobial sepsis. These effects correspond to changes in NF-κB.
