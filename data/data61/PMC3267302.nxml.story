Conventional furosemide tablets are practically insoluble in water, have slow onset of action (45-60 min) and poor bioavailability (39-53%), and therefore cannot be given in emergency clinical situations like hypertension or pulmonary edema. So purpose of research was to provide a fast dissolving oral dosage form of furosemide, which can provide quick onset of action by using concept of mixed hydrotropy. Initially solubility of furosemide was determined individually in 4 hydrotropic agents namely urea, sodium acetate, sodium benzoate, sodium citrate at concentration of 10, 20, 30 and 40% w/v solutions using purified water as solvent. Highest solubility was obtained in 40% sodium benzoate solution. Then different combinations of 2, 3 and 4 hydrotropic agents in different ratios were used to determine solubility, so that total concentration of hydrotropic agents was always 40%. Highest solubility was obtained in solution of urea+sodium benzoate+sodium citrate at optimum ratio of 15:20:5. This optimized combination was utilized in preparing solid dispersions by common solvent technique using distilled water as solvent. Solid dispersions were evaluated for flow properties, XRD, DSC, SEM and were also compressed to form tablets. Dissolution studies of conventional and prepared tablets were done using USP Type II apparatus. It was concluded that the concept of mixed hydrotropic solid dispersion is novel, safe and cost-effective technique for enhancing bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs by dissolving drug in nonionized form. The magical enhancement in solubility of furosemide is clear indication of its potential to be used in future for other poorly water-soluble drugs in which low bioavailability is major concern.
