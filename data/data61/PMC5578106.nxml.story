The change of pectin epitopes during procambium–cambium continuum development was investigated by immunolocalization in poplar. The monoclonal antibody JIM5 labels homogalacturonan (HGA) with a low degree of esterification, and the monoclonal antibody JIM7 labels HGA with a high degree of methyl-esterification. Arabinan, rather than galactan, and HGA with low degree of esterification were located in the cell walls of procambial, while HGA with a low degree of esterification was located in the tangential walls, and galactan was located in both the tangential and radial walls of procambial, yet nearly no arabinan was located in the tangential walls of the cambial cells. The changes in pectin distribution took place when periclinal divisions appeared within a procambial trace. The distribution difference of pectin epitopes was also present in procambium–cambium derivatives. The arabinan existed in all cell walls of primary xylem, but was absent from the tangential walls of secondary xylem cells. The galactan existed only in mature primary phloem. Furthermore, 19 pectin methylesterases (PMEs) genes were identified by RNA sequencing, six genes presented highly differentially and were supposed to be involved in the cell wall esterification process. The results provide direct evidence of the dynamic changes of pectin epitopes during the development of the procambium–cambium continuum in poplar.
