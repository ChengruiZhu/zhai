 1. The region of most active mitosis per mm. of cross-section in the intestine is the entodermal epithelial tube. The mitotic figures primarily follow the path of a right-handed helix. In one of the twenty embryos the mitotic figures describe the path of a right-handed helix. 2. The region of least active or relatively passive growth per mm. of cross-section is the mesenchyme, derived from the splanchnic mesoderm surrounding the epithelial tube. 3. The rapid expansion, due to epithelial growth in a rotating spiral manner, of the intestinal lumen is greater than the activity manifest in the surrounding mesenchyme. This causes a pressure in the latter resulting in a flattening and elongation of the mesenchymal cells. The successive changes in shape of these cells through the spherical, ellipsoidal, and spindle cellular phases are seen. The mesenchymal wall decreases in thickness, due to tension caused by epithelial tubular dilation. 4. The rotating spiral growth of the epithelial cells causes the formation of a series of mesenchymal cellular and fibrillar concentric rings due to the centripetal force of the former. 5. The circular, smooth muscle cells are differentiated in the outer, more condensed margins of the ring. At these points the developing tensional stresses are greater than within the ring. 6. The inner circular smooth muscle coat is the first one differentiated and is incident to the rapid growth of the epithelial tube in diameter. The former soon tends to restrict the growth of the epithelial tube in diameter. The tube, pursuing the lines of least resistance, grows in length. During the period of rapid growth in length the outer longitudinal muscle coat is in the process of formation. 7. The tensional stresses to which the elongated strained mesenchymal cells are subjected appear to be a dynamic stimulus to smooth muscle differentiation. 8. From this study of a closely graded and progressive series of sections of intestinal development, the conclusion is drawn that muscle tissue is not self-differentiating, in the strict sense of the term, but that the
