The mean ages of participants (n=17;7W&10M) were 47,11± 1,28yrs, weight 72,4±13,10kg, height 1,68±0,069cm, and body mass index were 25,57±3,41kg/cm2. All were under physiotherapy with moderate degree of shoulder pain during movement and rest. They gave their own written consent to participate voluntarily to the test protocol. Their sosciodemografic features (physical features, habit of physical activity) were taken with a specially prepared questionnaire for this study. Their muscle power (JTech Myometry) and range of motion-ROM of shoulder joints were assessed before the test protocol. The active external-internal rotations were tested as before and after KT while the participants sat on a stable chair, forearm was supported on the table with as much as possible 90° of shoulder abduction within the pain limits. The hand was in supination and the line drawn on the dorsum of the hand and forearm was to nominate the longitudinal axis. The photographs of each participant were taken by IPhone 4 (Apple) in direct line just opposite to the forearm to record the last position of the forearm during shoulder rotations. An eye band and a headphone were used during the test. Through a universal on-screen digitizer (Desktop Ruler™) the goniometric measurements were double checked on the computer. Their pain was assessed through Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) as before and after KT application. The disability they faced to during their daily life was assessed by Disability of Arm Shoulder and Hand Questionnaire (DASH) as before and after KT application. Y shaped KT was applied to subscapular muscles, the medial arm reaches towards the spine of scapula and the lateral arm was towards the acromion. All data were analysed statistically. The descriptive statistics were used for the physical features of the participants. Wilcoxon Signed Rank test was used for the significance of the data (p< 0.05) and Spearmen Correlation was used to understand the relation between the data.
