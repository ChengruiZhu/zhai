The mammalian olfactory bulb responds to odor stimulation by generating fast oscillations in its electrical field potential. Such oscillations are indications that a substantial number of principal neurons in the olfactory bulb are coordinating their activities in time, which often means that their action potentials are synchronized, or partly synchronized, such that the pattern of small differences in their spike times contains olfactory sensory information. We are interested in the mechanisms by which olfactory bulb circuitry can transform sensory information from the temporally unsophisticated spike rates of primary sensory neurons into this sophisticated cortical format. We present a biophysically explicit, multiscale dynamical model of the olfactory bulb network that generates these oscillations. The elements of this model are designed to adhere to experimental findings from individual neurons, membrane currents, and synapses as well as the functional network. Together, these elements generate gamma oscillations exhibiting the full range of properties of those in the biological system. We show that these dynamics arise from an inhibition-coupled oscillator framework, a type of dynamical system with some established mathematical properties. This finding enables us to understand how the olfactory system translates sensory information for distribution in the central nervous system, and how different areas of the brain can mechanistically coordinate with one another so as to regulate the flow of sensory information to appropriate target structures.
