Sub-cellular localisation of proteins is critical to their function in all cellular processes; proteins localising to their intended micro-environment, e.g organelles, vesicles or macro-molecular complexes, will meet the interaction partners and biochemical conditions suitable to pursue their molecular function. Therefore, sound data and methods to reliably and systematically study protein localisation, and hence their mis-localisation and the disruption of protein trafficking, that are relied upon by the cell biology community, are essential. Here we present a method to infer protein localisation relying on the optimal integration of experimental mass spectrometry-based data and auxiliary sources, such as GO annotation, outputs from third-party software, protein-protein interactions or immunocytochemistry data. We found that the application of transfer learning algorithms across these diverse data sources considerably improves on the quantity and reliability of sub-cellular protein assignment, compared to single data classifiers previously applied to infer sub-cellular localisation using experimental data only. We show how our method does not compromise biologically relevant experimental-specific signal after integration with heterogeneous freely available third-party resources. The integration of different data sources is an important challenge in the data intensive world of biology and we anticipate the transfer learning methods presented here will prove useful to many areas of biology, to unify data obtained from different but complimentary sources.
