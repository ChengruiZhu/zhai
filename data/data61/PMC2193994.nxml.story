Stromal-derived factor (SDF)-1 and its G protein–coupled receptor, CXCR4, regulate stem/progenitor cell migration and retention in the marrow and are required for hematopoiesis. We show here an interaction between CXCR4 and the Src-related kinase, Lyn, in normal progenitors. We demonstrate that CXCR4-dependent stimulation of Lyn is associated with the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase). This chemokine signaling, which involves a Src-related kinase and PI3-kinase, appears to be a target for BCR/ABL, a fusion oncoprotein expressed only in leukemia cells. We show that the binding of phosphorylated BCR/ABL to Lyn results in the constitutive activation of Lyn and PI3-kinase, along with a total loss of responsiveness of these kinases to SDF-1 stimulation. Inhibition of BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase with STI571 restores Lyn responsiveness to SDF-1 signaling. Thus, BCR/ABL perturbs Lyn function through a tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism. Accordingly, the blockade of Lyn tyrosine kinase inhibits both BCR/ABL-dependent and CXCR4-dependent cell movements. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that Lyn-mediated pathological crosstalk exists between BCR/ABL and the CXCR4 pathway in leukemia cells, which disrupts chemokine signaling and chemotaxis, and increases the ability of immature cells to escape from the marrow. These results define a Src tyrosine kinases-dependent mechanism whereby BCR/ABL (and potentially other oncoproteins) dysregulates G protein–coupled receptor signaling and function of mammalian precursors.
