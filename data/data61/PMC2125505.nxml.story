 The cerebrospinal fluid taken very early and quite late in the course of acute poliomyelitis exhibits no neutralizing action on filtered poliomyelitic virus. The blood serum on the 6th day of the disease already contains the neutralizing principles. The injection of sterile horse serum into the cerebrospinal meninges in monkeys increases their permeability, so that they permit the immunity neutralizing principles passively injected into the blood to pass into the cerebrospinal fluid. The passage in passively immunized monkeys takes place during a relatively brief space of time and apparently only while the inflammatory reaction produced by the horse serum is at its height. It is established for monkeys and rendered probable for man that the intraspinal injection of immune serum in poliomyelitis is curative. In monkeys normal serum exerts no such action, and at present nothing can be stated definitely regarding the therapeutic effect of normal serum in man except that probably any benefits which may arise from its employment would be attributable not to the action of the serum as such, but to the escape of circulating immunity principles in the blood made possible by the aseptic inflammation set up by it in the meninges. As the immunity principles appear in the blood only after several days, and the reported favorable effects of the immune serum treatment relate to the first days of illness, the employment of normal serum is thus not indicated, while that of an immune serum is.
