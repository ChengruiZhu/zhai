Developments of new classes of efficient compression algorithms, software systems, and hardware for data intensive applications in today's digital health care systems provide timely and meaningful solutions in response to exponentially growing patient information data complexity and associated analysis requirements. Of the different 1D medical signals, electroencephalography (EEG) data is of great importance to the neurologist for detecting brain-related disorders. The volume of digitized EEG data generated and preserved for future reference exceeds the capacity of recent developments in digital storage and communication media and hence there is a need for an efficient compression system. This paper presents a new and efficient high performance lossless EEG compression using wavelet transform and neural network predictors. The coefficients generated from the EEG signal by integer wavelet transform are used to train the neural network predictors. The error residues are further encoded using a combinational entropy encoder, Lempel-Ziv-arithmetic encoder. Also a new context-based error modeling is also investigated to improve the compression efficiency. A compression ratio of 2.99 (with compression efficiency of 67%) is achieved with the proposed scheme with less encoding time thereby providing diagnostic reliability for lossless transmission as well as recovery of EEG signals for telemedicine applications.
