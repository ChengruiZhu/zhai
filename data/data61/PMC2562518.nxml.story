New exons have been created and added to existing functional genes during eukaryotic genome evolution. Alu elements, a class of primate-specific retrotransposons, are a major source of new exons in primates. However, recent analyses of expressed sequence tags suggest that the vast majority of Alu-derived exons are low-abundance splice forms and represent non-functional evolutionary intermediates. In order to elucidate the evolutionary impact of Alu-derived exons, we investigated the splicing of 330 Alu-derived exons in 11 human tissues using data from high-density exon arrays with multiple oligonucleotide probes for every exon in the human genome. Our exon array analysis and further RT-PCR experiments reveal surprisingly diverse splicing patterns of these exons. Some Alu-derived exons are constitutively spliced, and some are strongly tissue-specific. In SEPN1, a gene implicated in a form of congenital muscular dystrophy, our data suggest that the muscle-specific inclusion of an Alu-derived exon results from a human-specific splicing change after the divergence of humans and chimpanzees. Our study provides novel insight into the evolutionary significance of Alu exonization events. A subset of Alu-derived exons, especially those derived from more ancient Alu elements in the genome, may have contributed to functional novelties during primate evolution.
