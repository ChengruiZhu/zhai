Inflammatory fibroid polyps (IFP) are rare, benign lesions of the gastrointestinal tract. Recent molecular studies of IFPs identified platelet-derived growth factor receptor Î± (PDGFRA)-activating mutations, suggesting possible neoplastic qualities to IFPs. IFPs originate from the submucosa and often extend into the overlying mucosa. Although certain IFPs infiltrate the muscularis propria focally, disruption of the muscularis propria and penetration into the subserosa is extremely rare. The current study presents an unusual case of an ileal IFP. A 48-year-old female visited the Department of Surgery, Chonbuk National University Hospital (Jeonju, Republic of Korea) due to abdominal pain. Radiological study demonstrated an ileocecal-type intussusception due to a luminal polypoid mass of the ileum. The excised tumor consisted of haphazardly arranged epithelioid and spindled cells in a fibromyxoid stroma, with an abundant vascular network, accompanied by an inflammatory reaction predominantly composed of eosinophilic infiltrates. The infiltrating tumor cells disrupted the muscularis mucosa above the tumor cells and the muscularis propria below the tumor cells, and extended into the subserosa. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for vimentin and cluster of differentiation 34, while they were negative for keratin, PDGFRA, smooth muscle actin, desmin, S-100 protein, DOG-1 and c-kit. Sequencing analysis of c-kit exons 9, 11, 13 and 17, and PDGFRA exons 12 and 18 indicated a wild-type status. The patient has remained well for 12 months after surgery without further treatment, with no recurrence of the tumor. Although spread of IFP under the muscularis propria is rare, identification of similar cases and further study will enhance our understanding of the nature of this tumor.
