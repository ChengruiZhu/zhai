Regulation of microRNAs (miRNA) has been extensively investigated in diseases; however, little is known about the roles of miRNAs in cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD). The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential involvement of miRNAs in CCD. In vitro site-directed mutagenesis was performed to construct three mutant Runx2 expression vectors, which were then transfected into LS8 cells and MC3T3-E1 cells, to determine the impact on amelogenesis and osteogenesis, respectively. miRCURY LNA miRNA microarray identify miR-185-5p as a miRNA target commonly induced by all three Runx2 mutants. Real-time quantitative PCR was applied to determine the expression of miR-185-5p and Dlx2 in samples. Dual-luciferase reporter assays were conducted to confirm Dlx2 as a legitimate target of miR-185-5p. The suppressive effect of miR-185-5p on amelogenesis and osteogenesis of miR-185-5p was evaluated by RT-PCR and western blot examination of Amelx, Enam, Klk4, and Mmp20 gene and protein expression, and by Alizarin Red stain. We found that mutant Runx2 suppressed amelogenesis and osteogenesis. miR-185-5p, induced by Runx2, suppressed amelogenesis and osteogenesis. Furthermore, we identified Dlx2 as direct target of miR-185-5p. Consistently, Dlx2 expression was inversely correlated with miR-185-5p levels. This study highlights the molecular etiology and significance of miR-185-5p in CCD, and suggests that targeting miR-185-5p may represent a new therapeutic strategy in prevention or intervention of CCD.
