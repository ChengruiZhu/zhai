Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) comprise a large group of disorders of catabolism, mostly due to deficiency of a single glycan-cleaving hydrolase. The consequent endo-lysosomal accumulation of undigested or partially digested substrates in cells of virtually all organs, including the nervous system, is diagnostic of these diseases and underlies pathogenesis. A subgroup of LSDs, the glycosphingolipidoses, are caused by deficiency of glycosidases that process/degrade sphingolipids and glycosphingolipids (GSLs). GSLs are among the lipid constituents of mammalian membranes, where they orderly distribute and, together with a plethora of membrane proteins, contribute to the formation of discrete membrane microdomains or lipid rafts. The composition of intracellular membranes enclosing organelles reflects that at the plasma membrane (PM). Organelles have the tendencies to tether to one another and to the PM at specific membrane contact sites that, owing to their lipid and protein content, resemble PM lipid rafts. The focus of this review is on the MAMs, mitochondria associated ER membranes, sites of juxtaposition between ER and mitochondria that function as biological hubs for the exchange of molecules and ions, and control the functional status of the reciprocal organelles. We will focus on the lipid components of the MAMs, and highlight how failure to digest or process the sialylated GSL, GM1 ganglioside, in lysosomes alters the lipid conformation and functional properties of the MAMs and leads to neuronal cell death and neurodegeneration.
