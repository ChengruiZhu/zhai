How does the human brain analyze natural sounds? Previous functional neuroimaging research could only describe the response patterns that sounds evoke in the human brain at the level of preferential regional activations. A comprehensive account of the neural basis of human hearing, however, requires deriving computational models that are able to provide quantitative predictions of brain responses to natural sounds. Here, we make a significant step in this direction by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with computational modeling. We compare competing computational models of sound representations and select the model that most accurately predicts the measured fMRI response patterns. The computational models describe the processing of three relevant properties of natural sounds: frequency, temporal modulations and spectral modulations. We find that a model that represents spectral and temporal modulations jointly and in a frequency-dependent fashion provides the best account of fMRI responses and that the functional specialization of auditory cortical fields can be partially accounted for by their modulation tuning. Our results provide insights on how natural sounds are encoded in human auditory cortex and our methodological approach constitutes an advance in the way this question can be addressed in future studies.
