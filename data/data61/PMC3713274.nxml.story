Using immunohistochemical staining for alpha-smooth muscle actin (Î±-SMA), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), S100 protein (S100), p63, cytokeratin 14 (CK14), and cytokeratin 19 (CK19), we studied acinar and myoepithelial cells of major and minor salivary glands obtained from 14 donated cadavers (78-92 years old) and 5 donated fetuses (aborted at 15-16 weeks of gestation). CK and p63 expression was investigated only in the adult specimens. SMA was detected in all adult glands as well as in fetal sublingual and pharyngeal glands. GFAP expression was seen in a limited number of cells in adult glands, but was highly expressed in fetal pharyngeal glands. S100-positive myoepithelial-like cells were present in adult minor glands as well as in fetal sublingual and pharyngeal glands. Expression of p63 was evident in the ducts of adult glands. CK14 immunoreactivity was observed in a limited number of glandular cells in adults, in contrast to consistent expression of CK19. In both adults and fetuses, a mosaic expression pattern was usually evident for each of the examined proteins. A difference in immunoreactivity for the nerve markers GFAP and S100 was observed between the major and minor glands. Thus, in the present histologic study, we distinguished between the specific gland types on the basis of their immunohistochemical staining. A mosaic expression pattern suggested that the immunoreactivity against nerve protein markers in myoepithelial cells could not be due to the persistence of neural crest remnants or the physiological status of the gland, such as age-related degeneration.
