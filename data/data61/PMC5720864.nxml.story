The spinal accessory nerve (SAN) or XI cranial nerve is frequently encountered during neck surgery, and as such is at risk of iatrogenic injury, resulting in "shoulder syndrome". Modified neck dissection (MND) with preservation of the SAN is based on desire to minimise the functional deformity associated with section of the eleventh nerve. The aim of this study was to analyse the intra-operative variations of the spinal accessory nerve pathway and to evaluate shoulder dysfunction postoperatively. The cross-sectional demonstration analysis was created through the medical records retrospectively of 165 consecutive patients who underwent neck dissections at our institution in the past 5 years with attention to ultrasound and MRI preoperative findings, type of neck dissection, type of identification and dissection of SAN, postoperative morbidity and survival rate. The safest identification of SAN is in the posterior neck triangle where it may be recognised exiting from the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) at Erb's point. For exact preoperative planning, ultrasound and MRI are superior to determine the position of the eleventh nerve. The mean distance between the greater auricular point and the SAN was 0.90 cm. Average length of the trunk from Erb's point until the penetration in the trapezius muscle was around 5.1 cm, ranging from 4.8 to 5.4 cm. The diversity in the course from the posterior border of the SCM and posterior neck triangle was confirmed in 9 cases (15%), predominantly at the level of entering the posterior neck triangle. The frequency of postoperative morbidity of SAN was 46.7% for radical neck dissections, 42.5% for selective neck dissections and 25% for MND. For each separate type of dissection, different subtypes were included. Identification of the SAN over established landmarks is unconditionally reliant on the exact preoperative mapping of the nerve with imaging diagnostics. MND has similar regional control rates to more comprehensive operations in appropriately selected patients and significantly reduces the risk of functional disability.
