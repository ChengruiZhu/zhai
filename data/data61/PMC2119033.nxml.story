In an attempt to identify a molecule in target recognition by CD3- large granular lymphocytes (LGL), we have generated a rabbit antiidiotypic (anti-ID) serum against a monoclonal antibody (mAb 36) that reacted with the cell membrane of K562. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that the anti-ID serum bound selectively to CD3- LGL and that F(ab')2 fragments of the anti-ID serum blocked both target cell binding and lysis by NK cells. Stimulation of CD3- LGL with F(ab')2 fragments resulted in the release of serine esterases and the secretion of interferon gamma. Furthermore, anti-ID F(ab')2 antibodies crosslinked to anti-DNP F(ab')2 mediated directed cytotoxicity of a non- natural killer (NK)-susceptible mouse target (YAC-1) via this surface ligand. These functional reactivities were only removed by adsorption with the specific idiotype. Protein analysis showed that the anti-ID serum immunoprecipitated 80-, 110-, and 150-kD proteins. Using this anti-ID, a partial cDNA was cloned and an antipeptide antiserum was made against the portion of the predicted amino acid sequence that corresponded to a portion of the ID binding region. This antipeptide serum exhibited similar functional and biochemical reactivities to those observed with the anti-ID serum. These data suggest that the cell surface moiety recognized by the anti-ID and anti-p104 is novel and is selectively involved in both recognition and triggering of NK-mediated lytic function.
