The treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is an essential component of tuberculosis (TB) elimination in regions that have a low incidence of TB. However, the decision to treat individuals with LTBI must consider the limitations of current diagnostic tests for LTBI, the risk of developing active TB disease, the potential adverse effects from chemoprophylactic therapy, and the importance of treatment adherence. When an individual has been diagnosed with LTBI and active TB has been ruled out, this is followed by an evaluation of the risks and benefits of LTBI treatment within the context of the regional epidemiology of TB and public health priorities. Once the decision to treat LTBI has been reached, and the infection is not suspected to be due to drug-resistant TB, the recommended regimens include isoniazid and/or rifamycin-derivatives, and the choice of regimen will depend upon the clinical considerations for that individual, such as patient preference, concomitant medications, hepatic disease, pregnancy, or immunodeficiency. As the duration of treatment of LTBI therapy is many months, therapy must be offered within a plan that monitors for adverse drug reactions and emphasizes adherence. For latent multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) or extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) infection, the management is more complicated as there are few options for chemoprophylactic therapy and little evidence regarding the efficacy or risks of these regimens.
