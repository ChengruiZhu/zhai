Shaping of the T cell repertoire by selection during intrathymic maturation involves T cell receptor (TCR) recognition of major histocompatibility complex/self-antigen complexes. In this communication, we studied the ability of minor lymphocyte stimulating (Mls) determinants to act as self-tolerogens in the selection of the T cell repertoire. We demonstrate that unprimed T cells from normal as well as TCR transgenic mice form Mls-specific conjugates with antigen- presenting cells, and that this TCR-ligand interaction leads to elevation of intercellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i). Peripheral T cells from TCR transgenic mice expressing receptors specific for self-Mls antigen show no reactivities to Mlsa. However, a proportion of immature thymocytes from these mice show specific binding and strong [Ca2+]i elevation in response to self-antigen-presenting cells, although these thymocytes do not proliferate. This self-reactivity of thymocytes is inhibited by antibodies specific for TCR, CD4, CD8, class II molecules, lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1. These results demonstrate for the first time that before thymic negative selection, immature T cells can specifically interact with cells bearing self-antigen, and suggest that the resulting TCR- dependent signal transduction events provide a basis for negative selection of self-reactive T cells.
