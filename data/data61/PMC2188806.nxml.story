It has been proposed that the pathogenesis of melanoma proceeds through multiple stages, ranging from benign proliferation of melanocytic cells to acquisition of the capacity to invade tissues and metastasize. During investigations of cell surface antigens expressed by melanocytes and melanoma, we identified an antigen system that was expressed by cultured normal melanocytes but not by melanoma cell lines. mAbs against this antigen detected a 120-kD cell surface glycoprotein on melanocytes. This molecule had been identified previously as the binding protein for adenosine deaminase (ADAbp). ADAbp was expressed by 51 melanocyte cell lines derived from normal fetal, newborn, and adult skin and adult choroid, but not by 102 melanoma cell lines derived from primary and metastatic lesions. Studies with radiolabeled bovine adenosine deaminase, confirmed that melanocytes expressed binding sites for adenosine deaminase, but no binding sites were detected on cultured melanoma cells. Further studies showed that ADAbp+ melanocytes became ADAbp- upon malignant transformation in vitro. Immunohistochemical studies on a panel of frozen tissues demonstrated reactivity of anti- ADAbp mAbs with epidermal melanocytes and benign junctional nevi, but not with potentially premalignant dysplastic nevi or primary/metastatic melanoma lesions. These studies demonstrate that ADAbp expression is lost with malignant transformation of melanocytes, presumably at an early stage in the transformation process.
