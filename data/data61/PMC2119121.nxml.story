In these studies we have characterized the human cells that repopulate severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice after injection of adult peripheral blood or cord blood (hu-PBL-SCID mice). In all organs of the chimeras, and at any time point tested, single-positive (CD4+ or CD8+) T cells that expressed the alpha/beta T cell receptor (TCR) prevailed. All T cells were CD45RO+ and the majority were also HLA-DR+. Thus, the human T cells in the chimeras exhibited the phenotype of mature, memory cells that showed signs of recent activation. Cell cycle studies revealed a mitotically active human T cell population in the murine host. However, when freshly isolated from the chimeras, the human T cells were refractory to stimulation by anti-CD3 antibody but proliferated in response to exogenous interleukin 2. Chimera-derived human T cell lines retained this state of unresponsiveness to TCR- triggered proliferation for 4-6 wk in vitro. Subsequently, the T cell lines developed responses to anti-CD3 stimulation and 9 of 11 of the lines also proliferated in response to splenic stimulator cells of SCID mice. These data demonstrate that the human T cells are in a state of reversible anergy in the murine host and that xenoreactivity might play a critical role in hu-PBL-SCID mice. Mechanisms that may determine repopulation of SCID mice with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells are discussed.
