The aim of the present study was to study the effect of chronic treatment (9 weeks) of fluoxetine (20 mg/kg p.o.) a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor on blood glucose level and in prevention of diabetic neuropathic pain perception. Evaluation of diabetic neuropathy was performed after 9 weeks of single injection of streptozotocin (70 mg/kg i.v.) in rats. Blood glucose level, glycated haemoglobin, grip strength, pain sensitivity and threshold in diabetic rats were measured at the end of 9 weeks. The results of the present study indicate that the 9 weeks treatment of fluoxetine demonstrates hypoglycemic effect; it marked decreases the blood glucose level in diabetic treated animals. There was also decrease in the grip strength in diabetic rat indicates to induction of neuropathy or nerve damage. Fluoxetine increase the grip strength of diabetic rats. There was also found loss of pain perception in diabetes rats which measured using hot plate and tail flick methods. Fluoxetine increases the licking time and withdrawal latency in hot plate and tail flick test respectively indicates the presence of pain perception and prevention of nerve damage demonstrates its protective effect in diabetic neuropathy. Our study concludes the chronic treatment of fluoxetine significantly decreases the glycemic level as well as it protected from the development of diabetic neuropathy.
