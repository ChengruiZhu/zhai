A total of 56 patients were included in this study (30 male, 26 females) with a mean age of 33 years. Follow up was available for 49 patients at 6 months, 41 patients at 1 year and 26 patients at 2 years. Radiographic measurements were similar between groups. The remainder of the demographic data and baseline functional scores were not significantly different between CR and NR groups apart from height, which was larger in the no-repair group by 3.8 inches (p = .003). The HOS-ADL score significantly improved over time in both groups from 56.7 +/- 18.2 to 86.7 +/- 19 in the CR group (p < .0001) and from 66 +/- 19.2 to 86.9 +/- 23.2 in the NR group (p < .0001) at 1 year. The HOS-SS score significantly improved over time in both groups from 31.7 +/- 21.5 to 72.7 +/- 28.9 in the CR group (p < .0001) and from 38.9 +/- 25.6 to 79.3 +/- 35.8 in the NR group (p < .0001) at 1 year. However, there were no significant differences in functional scores (HOS-ADL, HOS-Sports subscale, iHOT-12, Modified HHS, VAS, VR-12 Physical Score and the VR-12 mental score) between groups at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years. Functional improvement was noted for all secondary outcome measures, however there was no significant difference between the groups at any time point. Pearson correlation coefficients identified a negative relationship between alpha angle and HOS-SS (-0.32, p = .053) suggesting that larger alpha angle may be associated with inferior functional outcome.
