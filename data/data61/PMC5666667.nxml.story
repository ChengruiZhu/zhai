An anastomotic leak (AL) is the most serious complication observed in laparoscopic anterior resection of rectal cancer (LARRC). In order to protect anastomosis from AL and avoid stoma reversal surgery in patients with ileostomy, spontaneously closing cannula ileostomy (SCCI) was used in LARRC and its safety and feasibility were assessed in the present study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that SCCI has been used in such a case. A total of 41 patients who underwent LARRC with SCCI or ileostomy procedures between November 2013 and August 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. The patient demographics, clinical features and surgical data were evaluated using a Mann-Whitney U-test, Fisher's exact test or linear-by-linear association. Demographics, surgical data and the majority of clinical features of the two groups were consistently similar. In the SCCI group, the length of postoperative stay, total cost and stoma period were significantly improved compared with those in the ileostomy group. Additionally, the median protective period in the SCCI group was 22 days [interquartile range (IQR), 19–22 days], the median time to cannula removal was 23 days (IQR, 20–24 days) and the median time to cannula stoma closure was 12 days (IQR, 11–13 days). No SCCI-associated complications occurred. No significant differences in routine complications, including staple-line bleeding, anastomotic leak, anastomotic dehiscence, anastomotic stenosis and wound infection, were identified between the two groups. In LARRC, the SCCI procedure was demonstrated to be a safe and feasible diverting technique to protect anastomosis from AL. In contrast to ileostomy, the SCCI procedure obviated the requirement for stoma reversal surgery, which resulted in decreased lengths of postoperative hospital stay, hospitalization costs and stoma periods.
