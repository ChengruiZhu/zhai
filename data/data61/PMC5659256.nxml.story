This study presents a process of developing a novel PI3Kâ€“mTOR inhibitor through the prodrug of a metabolite. The lead compound (compound 1) was identified with similar efficacy as that of NVP-BEZ235 in a tumor xenograft model, but the exposure of compound 1 was much lower than that of NVP-BEZ235. After reanalysis of the blood sample, a major metabolite (compound 2) was identified. Compound 2 exerted similar in vitro activity as compound 1, which indicated that compound 2 was an active metabolite and that the in vivo efficacy in the animal model came from compound 2 instead of compound 1. However, compound 1 was metabolized into compound 2 predominantly in the liver microsomes of mouse, but not in the liver microsomes of rat, dog, or human. In order to translate the efficacy in the animal model into clinical development or predict the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters in the clinical study using a preclinical model, we developed the metabolite (compound 2) instead of compound 1. Due to the low bioavailability of compound 2, its prodrug (compound 3) was designed and synthesized to improve the solubility. The prodrug was quickly converted to compound 2 through both intravenous and oral administrations. Because the prodrug (compound 3) did not improve the oral exposure of compound 2, developing compound 3 as an intravenous drug was considered by our team, and the latest results will be reported in the future.
