Through the proteomic analysis using 2-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, we found that 28, 23, 14, and 28 hepatic proteins were up-regulated at least a two-fold difference in intensity compared with the control group in mice treated with the docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, arachidonic acid, and linoleic acid, respectively. In contrast, 12 hepatic proteins were down-regulated with a ratio value of less than 0.5 compared to their control counterparts by these four fatty acids. All of the altered proteins were then sorted according to their biochemical properties related to metabolism, redox stress/inflammation, enzymatic reactions, and miscellaneous functions. The results provide evidence that PUFAs may act as either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory agents. Cytokine-challenged HepG2 cells were used to reveal the anti-inflammatory function of n-3 PUFAs. The results showed that interleukin (IL)-1β combined with IL-6 induced C-reactive protein (CRP) mRNA expression and its protein secretion by HepG2 cells. The CRP promoter activity was significantly increased in the IL-6-treated cells, whereas IL-1β alone had no effect. However, IL-1β and IL-6 acted synergistically to further enhance CRP promoter activities. Furthermore, n-3 PUFAs inhibited nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation and the phosphorylation of the nuclear signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) during cytokine-induced CRP production.
