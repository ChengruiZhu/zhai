Molecular based differentiation of bacterial species is important in phylogenetic studies, diagnostics and epidemiological surveillance, particularly where unusual phenotype makes the classical phenotypic identification of bacteria difficult. Typical bacterial differentiation methods are often challenged by a high genetic similarity among strains. For decades, the technique of choice to classify and identify bacteria was DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH). The boosting of whole-genome sequencing technology facilitated the development of bioinformatics alternatives that could assist a much wider number of laboratories and are less biased to experimental errors. Currently, the Genome-to-Genome Distance Calculator web service, implementing the Genome-BLAST Distance Phylogeny (GBDP) method, provides the highest correlation to conventional DDH. Our methodology shows that whole peptide fingerprinting may complement the outputs of GBDP, i.e. experimental mass spectra may be used to cluster the bacteria, and more specifically it has been found useful for bacterial classification at the species and subspecies level. In addition, we present here how peptidome subsets obtained from in silico digestion of the peptidomes, is an efficient way to maintain the phylogenetic signal whilst reducing the total amount of data, making this methodology suitable for handling large data sets as in the case of epidemiologic studies.
