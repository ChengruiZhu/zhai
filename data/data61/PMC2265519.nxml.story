Chaperonin complexes capture proteins that have not yet reached their functional (“native”) state. Non-native proteins cannot perform their function correctly and threaten the survival of the cell. The chaperonins help these proteins to reach their native state. The prokaryotic GroEL-GroES chaperonin is an ellipsoidal protein complex that is approximately 16 nm long. It consists of two chambers that are joined at the bottom. Interestingly, protein repair by this chaperonin is not a one-step process. Typically, several capture and release steps are needed before the target protein reaches its native state. It is commonly assumed that substrate proteins cannot translocate, i.e., move inside the complex from one chamber to the other. In the absence of translocation, proteins that have not yet reached their functional conformation have to be released into the cytosol before being recaptured by a chaperonin. We present multi-scale simulations that show that it is, in fact, surprisingly easy for substrate proteins to translocate between the two chambers via an axial pore that is filled with disordered protein filaments. This finding suggests that non-native proteins can be squeezed like toothpaste from one chamber to the other: the incorrect structure of the protein is broken up during translocation and the protein has an increased probability to find its native state when it reaches the other chamber. The possibility for intra-chaperonin translocation obviates the need for a potentially dangerous release of non-native proteins.
