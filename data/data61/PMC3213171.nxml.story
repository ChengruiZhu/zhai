Mathematical models are powerful tools to understand and predict the behavior of complex systems. However, the complexity presents many challenges in developing such models. In the case of a biological cell, a fully detailed and comprehensive model of a major function such as signaling and metabolism remains out of reach, due to the very large number of interdependent biochemical reactions that are required to carry out the function. In this regard, one practical approach is to develop simplified models that nevertheless preserve the essential features of the cell as a complex system by better understanding the chemical organization of the cell, or the layout of the biochemical network. In this work, we describe a computational method to systematically identify closely interacting groups of biochemical reactions by recognizing the modular hierarchy inherent in biochemical networks. We focus on cyclical interactions based on the rationale that reactions that mutually influence each other belong in the same group. We demonstrate our method on a signaling and metabolic network and show that the results confirm biological intuition as well as provide new insights into the coordination of biochemical pathways. Prospectively, our modularization method could be used to systematically derive simplified and practically useful models of complex biological networks.
