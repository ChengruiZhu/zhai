., ventrally, to the site of needle puncture forming an oval or elongated inflammatory zone. Subsequent injections of the same strain into the skin beyond and ventral to the apparent edge of the lesion showed that these areas in the supposed direction of the lymph flow likewise became resistant but not quite to the same degree as in the inflammatory area. The contiguous areas above, behind, and in front of the healed lesion exhibited only a very mild degree of resistance. The other side of the rabbit where no previous injections had been made reacted as did the normal skin. Repeated injections on the same side bring about diminishing local reaction until there is almost no lesion following the injection of the standard skin dose. Thus there is a gradual spread of skin resistance on the inoculated side, whereas the non-injected side of the rabbit reacts normally. Finally, however, after many injections over relatively long periods the non-injected side becomes resistant, but at this time, there is evidence of general humoral immunity as shown by the presence of agglutinins and antitoxin in the blood. The local resistance is apparently not entirely specific, for the areas with the previous lesion and ventral to it become more resistant to another strain of beta hemolytic streptococcus, though in less degree, and to a virulent strain of
