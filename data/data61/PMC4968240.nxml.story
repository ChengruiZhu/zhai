Our cohort included thirteen players that were centers, 15 defensemen, 20 goalies, and 22 wings. The average overall draft number was 57 (range 1 to 228), and average age at surgery was 27 years (range 17 to 38). Forty of the 70 athletes (57%) continued to play professionally a minimum of 5 years after hip arthroscopy. As of the most recent 2015 season, the average NHL length of career was 13 years (range 8 to 23 years), with an average of 6.9 years played following hip arthroscopy. Therre was no different in length of career and years played when goalies were compared to other players(p=0.760). Length of career and years played after arthroscopy correlated with age at surgery (r=0.799 and r=-0.408). Players who played 5 or more years after arthroscopy were significantly younger than those who did not (25 vs. 30 years, p=0.001). Sixty-five players (93%) had labral repair and 5 (7%) had labral reconstruction. There were no differences in length of career or years played after arthroscopy based on type of labral treatment (p=0.278). Ten patients (14%) additionally underwent microfracture of the acetabulum for chondral damage, and no players required microfracture of the femoral head. Players who had microfracture were older (31 vs 26 years, p=0.007) and had longer careers (17 vs. 13 years, p=0.036). There was no difference in years played after surgery between the microfracture group and those who did not have microfracture (5 vs 4.9 years, p=0.854). Multiple regression analysis showed the only independent predictor of years played after arthroscopy was age (r2=0.232, p=0.001).
