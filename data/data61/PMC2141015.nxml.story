 1. Equations describing the geotropic orientation of young rats as a function of the inclination of the surface on which creeping take place, under standardized conditions, are found to be of similar form but with different values of the contained constants, when several different, genetically stabilized lines or races are compared. The values of these constants are characteristic for the several races. 2. The biological "reality" of the differences between young rats of two races, as given mathematical form in terms of these parameters and coefficients, can be submitted to radical test by investigating their behavior in inheritance. A simple result favorable to the inquiry would be decisive; a complex, non-clear result would not however be definitely unfavorable to the view that "real" differences in behavior are in question. The actual result is of a kind demonstrating (a) the efficiency of the original formulations, and (b), at the same time, the definite inheritance of certain quantitative aspects of geotropic behavior. 3. On the assumption that orientation on a sloping surface is achieved when, within a threshold difference, the tension-excitations on the two sides of the body (legs) are the same, the angle of oriented progression (θ) can be taken as a direct measure of the total excitation. This is consistent with the equation, accurately obeyed by our initial races, Δ cos θ/Δ
