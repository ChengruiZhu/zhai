A chromosomal double-strand break (DSB) poses a severe threat to genome integrity, and budding yeast cells use several homologous recombination mechanisms to repair the break. In gene conversion (GC), both ends of the DSB share homology to an intact donor locus, and the break is repaired by copying the donor to create a small patch of new DNA synthesis. In break-induced replication (BIR), only one side of the DSB shares homology to a donor, and repair involves assembly of a recombination-dependent replication fork that copies sequences to the end of the template chromosome, yielding a nonreciprocal translocation. Both processes require that the DSB ends be resected by 5′ to 3′ exonucleases, involving several proteins or protein complexes, including Exo1 and Sgs1-Rmi1-Top3-Dna2. We report that ectopic BIR is inhibited independently by Sgs1 and Exo1 and that overexpression of Rad51 recombinase further improves BIR, while GC is largely unaffected. Surprisingly, when both Sgs1 and Exo1 are deleted, and resection is severely impaired, half of the cells acquire new telomeres rather than completing BIR or GC. New telomere addition appears to result from the lack of resection itself and from the fact that, without resection, the Mec1 (ATR) DNA damage checkpoint fails to inactivate the Pif1 helicase that discourages new telomere formation.
