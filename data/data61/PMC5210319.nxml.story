 website, randomized controlled trials with patients receiving ERAs (bosentan, macitentan, or ambrisentan) in at least 1 treatment group were included. All reported adverse events of ERAs were evaluated. Summary relative risks and 95% CIs were calculated using random‐ or fixed‐effects models according to between‐study heterogeneity. In total, 24 randomized trials including 4894 patients met the inclusion criteria. Meta‐analysis showed that the incidence of abnormal liver function (7.91% versus 2.84%; risk ratio [RR] 2.38, 95% CI 1.36–4.18), peripheral edema (14.36% versus 9.68%; RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.20–1.74), and anemia (6.23% versus 2.44%; RR 2.69, 95% CI 1.78–4.07) was significantly higher in the ERA group compared with placebo. In comparisons of individual ERAs with placebo, bosentan (RR 3.78, 95% CI 2.42–5.91) but not macitentan (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.42–3.31) significantly increased the risk of abnormal liver function, whereas ambrisentan (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01–0.45) significantly decreased that risk. Bosentan (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.06–2.03) and ambrisentan (RR 2.02, 95% CI 1.40–2.91) but not macitentan (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.81–1.46) significantly increased the risk of peripheral edema. Bosentan (RR 3.09, 95% CI 1.52–6.30) and macitentan (RR 2.63, 95% CI 1.54–4.47) but not ambrisentan (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.20–8.48) significantly increased the risk of anemia. ERAs were not found to increase other reported adverse events compared with placebo.
