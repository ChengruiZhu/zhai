The purpose of this study is to determine the relative advantages of laparoscopic varicocelectomy compared to the conventional open high ligation of Palomo. We studied 193 patients who presented with varicocele. While 65 patients were treated by open high ligation of the testicular veins, 128 patients had laparoscopic varicocelectomy. In addition to varicocele ligation, 14 patients (11%) had laparoscopy-assisted right orchidopexy, and 5 patients (4%) had laparoscopic repair of concomitant right inguinal hernia. The mean hospital stay was 3.5 days and 1.3 days, respectively, and the recurrence rates were 10.8% and 3.9%, respectively. Return to normal activity was significantly earlier in Group II (mean 4.5 days) compared to Group I (mean 8.9 days). There was no incidence of testicular atrophy in any case in the study, regardless of whether the testicular artery was ligated or preserved during surgery. We conclude that laparoscopic varicocelectomy is safe, effective and minimally invasive. In addition to its better cosmetic results and advantage in case of bilateral disease, it allows excellent exposure and control of the affected vessels. Furthermore, the shorter hospital stay and the earlier return to normal activities are very important advantages in recommending this technique as an efficient alternative to the open surgical method.
