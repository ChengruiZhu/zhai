The human serotonin transporter belongs to the family of neurotransmitter transporters, which are located in the presynaptic nerve end, from where it is responsible for termination of synaptic serotonin signaling. Imbalance in serotonin concentration is related to various neuronal conditions such as depression, regulation of appetite etc. Very limited structural information of hSERT is available, but it is believed that the protein functions through an alternating access mechanism, where the central binding site is either exposed to the outside or the inside of the cell. We have previously published an experimentally validated outward-occluded homology model of hSERT, and here we reveal the inward-facing conformation of hSERT from molecular dynamics simulations, from which we can identify the main movements occurring during the translocation. From the inward-facing conformation we observe ion release, revealing important information on the sequence of events during transport. Following transport of the sodium ion, the substrate also shows early events of transport. The ion follows a cytoplasmic pathway as hinted at from experiments, and the ligand binding site becomes fully solvated by water through this same pathway. Experiments using an Asp437Asn mutant of hSERT confirm the prediction that Asp437 is a central residue in controlling ion transport.
