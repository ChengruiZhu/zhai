Over recent decades, the demand for complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has continued to rise in the US. Like the practice of traditional Western medicine, CAM is associated with not only significant health benefits but also significant risks. Unlike traditional Western medicine, however, much of CAM use is less regulated and often occurs unbeknownst to a patientâ€™s medical doctor. The use of herbals, dietary supplements, and over-the-counter (OTC) medications can result in adverse effects, and many significant interactions can occur when their use is combined with allopathic medications. Even the more peripheral CAM practices (eg, acupuncture, massage, yoga, and Reiki) have associated risk (eg, adverse effects or worsening of physical injury and conditions). There is, however, impetus for change: both patients and physicians favor increasing physician knowledge of CAM and the synergistic implementation of CAM into routine clinical practice. Although improvement has been achieved from contemporary physician educational efforts, recently published results from patient and physician surveys strongly indicate that additional effort to increase physician knowledge of CAM is needed. Utilizing a 37-item survey and convenience-sampling methodology, we collected detailed information from 114 physicians, fellows, and residents from the Ohio State University Medical Center regarding impediments to increasing physician knowledge of CAM and its implementation in routine clinical practice. The aggregate results of our survey data showed that most physicians 1) desired to increase their knowledge of CAM, 2) believed that less than half of their patients were spontaneously reporting their use of CAM therapies, 3) were not aware of available evidence-based resources on CAM, 4) preferred case-based lectures for learning about CAM, and 5) reported insufficient time during patient encounters as the primary barrier for increasing the implementation of CAM in routine clinical practice.
