All organisms live in environments that dynamically change in ways that are only partially predictable. The seasons, diurnal cycles, oceanic fluid dynamics, and the progression of food through the human gut, all impose some predictability on common microbial ecosystems. Microbes are also at the whim of random processes (like thermal motion) that introduce uncertainty into environmental change. Here, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze how cellular regulatory systems might balance this predictability and uncertainty to most effectively respond to a dynamic environment. We model a simple cellular goal: regulating a single enzyme to maximize the energy generated from a nutrient whose environmental concentration varies. In this context, optimal regulatory strategies are determined by an uncertainty ratio comparing cellular measurement noise and environmental variability. Intermediate levels of uncertainty call for sophisticated Bayesian decision rules, where selective advantage accrues to organisms that incorporate past experience in their inference of the current environmental state. When uncertainty is either high or low, optimal signal processing strategies are comparatively simple: constitutive expression or naive tracking, respectively. This work provides a theoretical basis for interpreting molecular signal processing algorithms and suggests that relative levels of environmental variability and cellular noise affect how microbes should process information.
