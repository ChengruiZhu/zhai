The AIDS epidemic, inflicted by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), has already claimed 25 million lives, thus posing a global threat. Since its discovery, several HIV subtypes have emerged, characterized by distinct genomic sequences and variable geographic locations. Here, we investigate the nature of the genetic differences among the subtypes. The neutral theory of evolution suggests that most genetic differences marginally affect the function of the encoded proteins (hence neutral) and thus occur randomly. Alternatively, changes in protein function are reflected by a pattern of nonrandom genetic differences. To address this issue, we developed a computational method, which studies the differences between sequences of different HIV subtypes, and estimates which of the explanations is more likely. Using a large sample of HIV protein sequences, we discovered that part of the variability among the subtypes is not random and possibly reflects different functional constraints imposed on the subtypes during the course of their evolution. An in-depth inspection of these nonrandom changes revealed a correlation with biological traits, such as drug resistance and mechanisms facilitating viral entry into the host cell. Interestingly, nonrandom changes are also characteristic of a viral strain that recently emerged in the former Soviet Union.
