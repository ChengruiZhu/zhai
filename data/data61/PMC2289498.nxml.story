Our previous studies showed that in hepatic RER of young chickens, nascent apoAI is not associated with lipoprotein particles and only becomes part of these lipoprotein structures in the Golgi. In this study, we have used three different methodologies to determine the locations of apoAI and apoB in the RER and compared them to that of albumin. Immunoelectron microscopic examination of the RER cell fractions showed that both apoAI and apoB were associated only with the RER membrane whereas albumin was located both within the lumen and on the limiting membrane of the vesicles. To examine the possibility of membrane integration of nascent apoAI and apoB in the RER, we administered L-[3H]leucine to young chickens for 10 min, isolated RER, treated this cell fraction with buffers of varying pH, and measured the release of radioactive albumin, apoAI, and apoB. The majority of nascent apoAI (64%), nascent apoB (100%), and nascent albumin (97%) was released from RER vesicles at pH 11.2, suggesting that, like albumin, apolipoproteins are not integrated within the membrane. To determine if nascent apoproteins are exposed to the cytoplasmic surface, we administered L-[3H]leucine to young chickens and at various times isolated RER and Golgi cell fractions. Radioactive RER and Golgi cell fractions were treated with exogenous protease and the percent of nascent apoAI and apoB accessible to proteolysis was determined and compared to that of albumin. At 5, 10, and 20 min of labeling, 35-56% of nascent apoAI and 60-75% of apoB in RER were degraded, while albumin was refractive to this treatment. At all times both apolipoproteins and albumin present in Golgi cell fractions were protected from proteolysis. These biochemical and morphological findings indicate that apoAI and apoB are associated with the rough microsomal membrane and are partially exposed to the cytoplasmic surface at early stages of secretion. They may later enter the luminal side of the ER and, on entering the Golgi, form lipoprotein particles.
