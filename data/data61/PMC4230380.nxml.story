Some frequently encountered deficiencies
in all-atom molecular
simulations, such as nonspecific protein–protein interactions
being too strong, and unfolded or disordered states being too collapsed,
suggest that proteins are insufficiently well solvated in simulations
using current state-of-the-art force fields. To address these issues,
we make the simplest possible change, by modifying the short-range
protein–water pair interactions, and leaving all the water–water
and protein–protein parameters unchanged. We find that a modest
strengthening of protein–water interactions is sufficient to
recover the correct dimensions of intrinsically disordered or unfolded
proteins, as determined by direct comparison with small-angle X-ray
scattering (SAXS) and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)
data. The modification also results in more realistic protein-protein
affinities, and average solvation free energies of model compounds
which are more consistent with experiment. Most importantly, we show
that this scaling is small enough not to affect adversely the stability
of the folded state, with only a modest effect on the stability of
model peptides forming α-helix and β-sheet structures.
The proposed adjustment opens the way to more accurate atomistic simulations
of proteins, particularly for intrinsically disordered proteins, protein–protein
association, and crowded cellular environments.
