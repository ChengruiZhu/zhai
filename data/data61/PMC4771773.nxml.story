Quorum sensing is a mechanism through which bacteria communicate by producing, releasing, and detecting signal molecules encoding information about cell population density. Quorum sensing allows bacteria to synchronize their behaviors and act as collectives. Often, quorum sensing controls cooperative behaviors that benefit the entire community, such as the production and secretion of costly metabolites. Some bacteria release multiple signal molecules which, once detected, funnel information into the same cellular response. Thus, the benefit of using multiple rather than a single signal is mysterious since the signals seem redundant. Here, we combine modeling and experiments to show that the evolutionary accumulation of multiple quorum-sensing systems can be attributed to social exploitation and kin recognition. When in low abundance, a strain that has acquired an additional quorum-sensing system can avoid cooperating and can exploit its ancestor strain, which contains one less quorum-sensing system. The cheater containing the additional system returns to a cooperative behavior when it is abundant. We also identify the molecular mechanisms necessary for the acquisition of an additional signaling system. Our work demonstrates that increased complexity in bacterial social signaling circuits can evolve without providing an adaptive advantage in a clonal population.
