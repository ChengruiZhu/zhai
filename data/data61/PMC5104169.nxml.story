Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-associated mortality globally. Interactions of the cancer cells with the tumor microenvironment are essential carcinogenic features for the majority of solid tumors, such as pancreatic cancer. The present study investigated the role of stromal activation in NSCLC and analyzed the surgical specimens of 93 patients by immunohistochemistry with regard to periostin (an extracellular matrix protein), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA; a marker of myofibroblasts) and cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31; a marker of endothelial cells), and the activated stroma index. There was a trend towards reduced overall survival for patients with high periostin expression (hazard ratio, 1.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.99–3.27; P=0.050). No significant correlations with overall survival were identified for α-SMA (P=0.930), CD31 (P=0.923), collagen (P=0.441) or the activated stroma index (P=0.706). In a multivariable analysis, the histological tumor subtype, tumor stage, lymph node involvement and resection status were independent prognostic factors in NSCLC, but none of the investigated immunohistochemical markers were prognostic factors. Thus, the tumor microenvironment and stroma activation did not prove to be of prognostic relevance for lung cancer, as it has been previously described for pancreatic cancer. Other markers of the microenvironment of NSCLC may be of higher prognostic value, pointing towards tumor-type specific effects.
