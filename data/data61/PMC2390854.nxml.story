Release of chemical (neurotransmitter)-filled vesicles at neuronal junctions called synapses leads to transmission of information between neurons. In a successful synaptic transmission, a voltage spike (action potential) generated by a presynaptic neuron initiates neurotransmitter vesicle release and leads to a small current in the postsynaptic neuron. For many synapses in the central nervous system, the probability that a neurotransmitter vesicle is released in response to an action potential is conspicuously small, raising the question whether transmission failures can in any way prove advantageous. Apart from “induced vesicle release” (in response to an action potential), vesicles are also released asynchronously (in absence of an action potential). An induced release probability that is too small samples the information poorly, as many of the incoming action potentials do not result in a postsynaptic current response. Maximizing induced release in order to maximize information transmission at a synapse is accompanied by the exceptionable outcome of increased asynchronous release; in addition, both these releases draw from the same neurotransmitter resource pool. A large release rate thus comprising both induced as well as asynchronous release of vesicles can suppress synaptic transmission via either depletion of neurotransmitter resources or desensitization of postsynaptic receptors. In this paper, we propose that the competing dynamics of induced and asynchronous vesicle release gives rise to an optimal release probability. Further, by comparing experimental data of astrocyte-enhanced synaptic transmission with simulations, we argue that synapses enwrapped by astrocytes operate close to our predicted optimum. This optimality is achieved through a closed-loop control circuitry that involves the presynaptic neuron and the synaptic astrocyte.
