 Experimental pneumonia due to Friedländer's bacillus was produced in white rats by the intrabronchial inoculation of the bacilli suspended in mucin. The pneumonia was lobar in type, was almost uniformly fatal, and simulated the acute form of the natural disease in human beings. The pathogenesis of the pneumonic lesion was studied by examination of microscopic sections of the lungs of animals killed at frequent intervals during the course of the infection. The histologic characteristics of the various stages of the pneumonia were essentially the same as those previously described in experimental pneumococcal (Type I) pneumonia except for the following differences: (1) In isolated areas of the lung in Friedländer's pneumonia many more bacteria were encountered in the alveoli than were ever noted in experimental pneumococcal pneumonia. (2) Abscess formation was common in the late stages of Friedländer's infection, whereas it was not noted in the pneumococcal lesion. (3) Organization of the alveolar exudate, rarely observed in experimental pneumococcal pneumonia, was a prominent feature of the pneumonia due to Friedländer's bacillus. The mechanism of spread of Friedländer's lesion appeared to be the same as that of pneumococcal pneumonia. Likewise there was noted the same phagocytosis of organisms in the lungs of even bacteremic animals dying of the infection.
