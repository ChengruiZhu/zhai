Currently, metastatic pancreatic cancer is associated with disappointing survival outcomes. This is largely due to a rapid progression of the disease and a precipitous deterioration in the health of affected individuals, especially elderly patients who are often unable to tolerate chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adoptive immunotherapy using cytokine-induced killer cells (CIK) as a first-line treatment for metastatic pancreatic cancer. Between December 2010 and June 2012 eight patients were enrolled in this study. All participants were elderly, suffering from metastatic pancreatic cancer, and unable to tolerate chemotherapy. All patients in this study received R-CIK therapy only as a first-line treatment. In the eight patients, 1 had complete response (CR), 5 had stable disease (SD) and 2 had progression disease (PD). Therefore, the overall response rate (ORR) was 12.5% (1/8) and the disease control rate (DCR) was 75.0% (6/8 patients). The 1-year survival rate was 37.5%, and the median overall survival time (mOS) was 13.04 months (95% CI: 5.9-20.2). The results indicated that no significant positive or negative predictive factors were identified by univariate analysis. The main adverse effect of R-CIK was fever and the side effect rate was 25.0% (2/8). Adoptive immunotherapy using R-CIK cells showed comparable OS to survival data seen in previous trials assessing conventional chemotherapies in elderly patients and the adverse effect is less pronounced.
