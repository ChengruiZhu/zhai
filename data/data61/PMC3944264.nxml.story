MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that interfere with translation of specific target mRNAs and thereby regulate diverse biological processes. Recent studies have suggested that miRNAs might have a role in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Here, we show that miR-542-3p, a well-characterized tumor suppressor whose downregulation is tightly associated with tumor progression via C-src-related oncogenic pathways, inhibits osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. miRNA array profiling in Medicarpin (a pterocarpan with proven bone-forming effects) induced mice calvarial osteoblast cells and further validation by quantitative real-time PCR revealed that miR-542-3p was downregulated during osteoblast differentiation. Over-expression of miR-542-3p inhibited osteoblast differentiation, whereas inhibition of miR-542-3p function by anti-miR-542-3p promoted expression of osteoblast-specific genes, alkaline phosphatase activity and matrix mineralization. Target prediction analysis tools and experimental validation by luciferase 3â€² UTR reporter assay identified BMP-7 (bone morphogenetic protein 7) as a direct target of miR-542-3p. It was seen that over-expression of miR-542-3p leads to repression of BMP-7 and inhibition of BMP-7/PI3K- survivin signaling. This strongly suggests that miR-542-3p suppresses osteogenic differentiation and promotes osteoblast apoptosis by repressing BMP-7 and its downstream signaling. Furthermore, silencing of miR-542-3p led to increased bone formation, bone strength and improved trabecular microarchitecture in sham and ovariectomized (Ovx) mice. Although miR-542-3p is known to be a tumor repressor, we have identified second complementary function of miR-542-3p where it inhibits BMP-7-mediated osteogenesis. Our findings suggest that pharmacological inhibition of miR-542-3p by anti-miR-542-3p could represent a therapeutic strategy for enhancing bone formation
