Transient global cerebral ischemia (tGCI) is a cerebrovascular disorder that can cause apoptotic neuronal damage and functional deficits. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was reported to be highly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and to exert neuroprotective effects against different CNS diseases. However, the effects of bFGF on tGCI have not been studied intensively. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of bFGF and its underlying mechanism in an animal model of tGCI. After intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of bFGF, functional improvement was observed, and the number of viable neurons increased in the ischemia-vulnerable hippocampal CA1 region. Apoptosis was induced after tGCI and could be attenuated by bFGF treatment via inhibition of p53 mitochondrial translocation. In addition, autophagy was activated during this process, and bFGF could inhibit activation of autophagy through the mTOR pathway. Rapamycin, an activator of autophagy, was utilized to explore the relationship among bFGF, apoptosis, and autophagy. Apoptosis deteriorated after rapamycin treatment, which indicated that excessive autophagy could contribute to the apoptosis process. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that bFGF could exert neuroprotective effects in the hippocampal CA1 region by suppressing excessive autophagy via the mTOR pathway and inhibiting apoptosis by preventing p53 mitochondrial translocation. Furthermore, our results suggest that bFGF may be a promising therapeutic agent to for treating tGCI in response to major adverse events, including cardiac arrest, shock, extracorporeal circulation, traumatic hemorrhage, and asphyxiation.
