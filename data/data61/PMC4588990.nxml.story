The cohort consisted of 48 patients involved in active sports. They identified themselves as participating in a sport around the time of their injury that primarily involved either the upper extremity (n = 35) or lower extremity (n = 13). Contact athletes were grouped with the upper extremity athletes. Upper extremity and contact sports included football, basketball, ice hockey, rock climbing, baseball, volleyball, and weightlifting. Lower extremity sports included running, skiing, snowboarding, mountain biking, and soccer. Average time to follow-up was 37 months (range, 19-79 months) in the UE group and 41 months (range, 18-76 months) in the LE group (p = 0.57). Average age at the time of surgery was 26 years (range, 16-42 years) in the UE group and 29 years (range, 18-45 years) in the LE group (p = 0.33). Twenty-three patients (23/35, 66%) in the UE group and 10 patients (10/13, 77%) in the LE group were able to return to their sport by the time of follow-up (p = 0.39). Average time to return to sport was 6.2 months (range, 3-12 months) in the UE/C group and 7.9 months (range, 3-18 months) in the LE group (p = 0.28). Of those patients able to return to their sport, 16 patients (16/23, 70%) in the UE group and 5 patients (5/10, 50%) in the LE group were able to return to their pre-injury activity level (p = 0.18). The average Marx Activity Scale was 11.9 and 11.5 in the UE and LE groups, respectively (p = 0.72), while the average SANE score was 85 and 87 in the UE and LE groups, respectively (p = 0.53). The average ASES score was 89 in the UE group and 94 in the LE group (p = 0.12). The WOSI score was 23% versus 26% in the UE and LE groups, respectively (p = 0.62). Patients were able to indicate reasons for their inability to return, many had more than one: eight patients did not return secondary to loss of strength, six due to pain, five had a fear of reinjury, 3 cited loss of speed as a reason, and 3 felt a sense of instability. Six patients did not return due to a loss of interest in their sport, or development of a new sport interest.
