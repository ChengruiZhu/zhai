Primary smooth muscle tumors of the thyroid gland are extremely rare neoplasms. Due to their rarity, clinical case studies concerning management are lacking. According to a literature review, only 19 cases of primary thyroid leiomyosarcomas (TLs) have been reported. In the majority of patients, the prognosis is poor since adjuvant radiochemotherapy is ineffective on local recurrence and on long-term survival. In this study, we report the case of a 77-year-old male affected by a rapidly enlarging mass of the anterior neck, associated with bilateral lung metastases, and increasing dysphagia and dyspnea during the previous 6 months. A Tir4 neoplasm fine needle cytological diagnosis of the right thyroid lobe was reached and the patient underwent total thyroidectomy (TT). Definitive histological examination identified a TL. The patient succumbed 40 days later due to respiratory distress. A literature review was performed and TL differential diagnoses, management, including alternative treatment strategies, and adjuvant therapy were analyzed. TL is an aggressive rare mesenchymal malignant tumor. Although an improved multimodal approach is often necessary, TT and neck dissection represent the treatment of choice and are often the only possible therapy. Adjuvant radiochemotherapy appears to be ineffective and a high mortality rate is observed. TL remains a fatal tumor, and innovative and more effective therapeutic strategies to improve management and outcomes are required.
