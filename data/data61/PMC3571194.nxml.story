Since its launch in 2010, over 1000 patients have been registered on Simple Telehealth. The service has been used by 300 clinicians in 45 clinical teams. User acceptability and satisfaction is high, and the system anecdotally provides benefits to healthcare practitioners. Simple Telehealth facilitates large-scale, low-cost telemonitoring programmes utilising existing lifestyle technology rather than bespoke, high-cost systems. It is anticipated that the telemonitoring functionality will bring quality of life and clinical benefits similar to those reported in recent Cochrane Reviews. Giving patients a greater understanding of their health status should also enhance self-care ability and—where appropriate—underpin behaviour change. We believe that Simple Telehealth can reduce the frequency of community visits, bringing immediate productivity savings in consumables and travel costs. In addition, the local health community benefits through reduced tariff costs for A&E attendances and hospital admissions. Micro-cases that simulate the economic benefits of Simple Telehealth have identified potential return on investment ratios of approximately 10:1. Building on initial successes, next-stage developments include enhanced links with social care alarm response services, Bluetooth-enabled physiological measurement and voice recognition functionality for users in whom SMS text entry proves difficult.
