Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are key components of regulatory networks that dictate various aspects of cellular decision-making. They are over-represented in major disease pathways, and are considered novel albeit currently difficult drug targets. Recognition of IDPs has extended the traditional protein structure-function paradigm, and various concepts have been proposed on how intrinsic disorder may confer crucial functional advantages. However, the physical basis of these concepts remains poorly established. In particular, while IDPs alone exist as ensembles of fluctuating structures, they frequently fold upon specific binding. Analysis of the physical timescales of protein folding and protein-protein encounter predicts that the requirement of peptide folding for specific binding could lead to a major kinetic bottleneck. In this work, carefully calibrated topology-based coarse-grained models were applied to directly simulate reversible folding and binding and investigate the recognition mechanisms of three IDP complexes. The results strongly support an electrostatically accelerated encounter and folding mechanism, where long-range electrostatic forces not only accelerate protein-protein encounter via “electrostatic steering” but also promote “folding-competent” encounter topologies to enhance the efficiency of IDP folding upon encounter.
