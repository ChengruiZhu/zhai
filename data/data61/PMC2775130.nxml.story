Proteins carry out most of the cellular processes, from metabolic reactions to the regulation and expression of genes. Tight and effective regulation of the executing protein machinery is commonly achieved by allostery. The only general requirement for allosteric communication is the transmission of a signal, e.g., the binding of a cofactor, from the ligand binding site to the allosteric (active) protein site; in other words an internal propagation of strain. Based on molecular dynamics simulations, we recently presented a method that allows visualization of force distribution in proteins. We here applied this method to MetJ, a transcription factor whose activity is regulated by a co-repressor. Interestingly, co-repressor binding does not cause visible structural changes, yet increases DNA binding affinity manyfold. We were able to reveal a network linking fluctuations of distal parts of MetJ, including the DNA binding interface. Mechanical strain caused by SAM binding propagates to certain key residues, thereby altering fluctuations and finally resulting in increased DNA binding affinity. By directly monitoring ligand induced strain, instead of conformational changes, which might be absent or slow, our force distribution analysis suggests itself suitable to detect the mechanically crucial motifs in allosterically regulated protein machineries.
