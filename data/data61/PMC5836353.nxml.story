A fictional journey was planned and carried out in a time machine, to know and understand the glorious past of Central Institute of Psychiatry (CIP), Ranchi. As Dr. Anand, the protagonist, went through different periods in the history of CIP, he narrated his experiences while meeting different peoples in different clinical settings. In this journey, he met Lt. Col Berkeley-Hill at European Mental Hospital, as it was in the 1930s. He tried to understand the relevance of Professor Mapother's report and its essence in relation to European and Indian psychiatric scenario during inter-war period, the significance of Moore-Taylor's report, and the direction of psychiatric training and teaching during postindependence era under Major RB Davis as the superintendent of Hospital for Mental Diseases (HMD). Here, Dr. Anand met the great rebel poet of Bengal (and the national poet of Bangladesh later), Kazi Nazrul Islam, who was here for a short period, before being shifted to Europe for further treatment. Dr. Anand also met other superintendents/directors of CIP during postindependence period and tried to understand the significance of those periods in the total journey of CIP till today. The journey started in the present and went back in time. Finally, a brief comparative analysis has been made regarding the status of CIP vis-Ã  -vis other important psychiatric institutes/hospitals in the past and present.
