Murine thymic T cells depleted of antigen-presenting cells proliferate poorly in response to crosslinking anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies or concanavalin A when cultured in conventional fetal calf serum- containing serum. However, in a serum-free medium formulated to contain, in addition to basic ingredients, insulin, transferrin, albumin, linoleic acid (ITLB), and retinol, proliferation is vigorous. The presence of retinol is critical, because when omitted, cells do not become activated. The subsets of T cells proliferating with the assistance of retinol cofactor are both CD4+ and CD8+ thymic T cells, and CD4+ peripheral T cells. Mature CD8+ T cells of lymph nodes can also be activated in ITLB medium plus retinol, provided that interleukin 2 (IL-2) is added. Retinol needs to be present at the time when T cell receptor triggering is initiated, suggesting that early activation events (G0 to G1 transition) are dependent on retinol. It is currently less clear whether or not subsequent events associated with G1 to S phase transition also require the presence of retinol. 14- hydroxy-retroretinol (14HRR) is a metabolic product of retinol in lymphocytes, and this retinoid effectively supports T cell activation in conjunction with a mitogen in lieu of retinol. Thus, while retinol and its intracellular product, 14HRR, are unable to activate T cells on their own, they are important cofactors. The requirement for retinol in CD3-mediated T cell activation cannot be satisfied by retinoic acid or ILs-1, 2, 4, and 6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha whereas interferon gamma can substitute for retinol. Our experiments are compatible with the idea that retinol, in the course of cellular activation, is converted to 14HRR, which is needed as intracellular messenger. If substantiated by molecular studies now underway, our data should lead to the description of a new signal pathway distinct from the retinoic acid signal pathway observed in nonlymphoid cells, but perhaps functioning by a similar mechanism, i.e., ligand-assisted transcriptional regulation.
