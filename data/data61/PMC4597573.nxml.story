121 unilateral ACL injury patients who underwent primary ACL reconstruction were examined. Partial ACL tears, in which intact anteromedial or posterolateral bundles were observed, were excluded. The patients who had severe collateral ligament injury, PCL injury or contralateral knee injury were also excluded. All patients were evaluated under general anesthesia before ACL reconstruction. Anterior tibial translation (ATT) was measured using the KT-1000 Knee Ligament Arthrometer with the knee at 30 degrees of flexion in both injured and contralateral knee, and the mean side-to-side difference in ATT was calculated. ATT during the Lachman test, and tibial acceleration during the pivot shift test were also measured with electromagnetic measurement system as we previously reported. The mean side-to-side difference in ATT during the Lachman test was also calculated. Subsequently, arthroscopic evaluation was performed, and the ACL remnants were classified into 4 morphologic patterns as follows, group 1: bridging between PCL and tibia, group2: bridging between the roof of intercondylar notch and tibia, group3: bridging between the lateral wall of the intercondylar notch and tibia, group 4: no substantial ACL remnants. All values were showed as mean ± standard deviation. One way Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare each value between 4 groups, and post hoc analysis was performed using Fisher’s protected least significance difference test. A P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
