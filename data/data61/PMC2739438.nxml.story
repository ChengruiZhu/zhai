Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) transporters are one of the largest families of membrane protein transporters and are ubiquitous to all three kingdoms of life. Structural studies of MFS transporters have revealed that the members of this superfamily share structural homology; however, due to weak sequence similarity, their structural similarity has only been found after structural determination. Even after the structures were solved, painstaking efforts were needed to detect functionally important residues. The identification of functionally important cooperative residues from sequences may provide an alternative way to understanding the function of this important class of proteins. Here, we show that it is possible to identify functionally important residues of MFS transporters by integrating two different evolutionary features, sequence conservation and co-evolutionary information. Our results suggest that the conserved cores of evolutionarily coupled residues are involved in specific substrate recognition and translocation of membrane protein transporters. Also, a subset of the identified residues comprises an interaction network connecting functional sites in the protein structure. The ability to identify functional residues from protein sequences may be helpful for locating potential mutagenesis targets in mechanistic studies of membrane protein transporters.
