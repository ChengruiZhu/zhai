Genome stability of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) is an important issue because even minor genetic alterations can negatively impact cell functionality and safety. The incorrect repair of DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) is the ultimate cause of the formation of chromosomal aberrations. Using G2 radiosensitivity assay, we analyzed chromosomal aberrations in pluripotent stem cells and somatic cells. The chromatid exchange aberration rates in hESCs increased manifold 2 hours after irradiation as compared with their differentiated derivatives, but the frequency of radiation-induced chromatid breaks was similar. The rate of radiation-induced chromatid exchanges in hESCs and differentiated cells exhibited a quadratic dose response, revealing two-hit mechanism of exchange formation suggesting that a non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair may contribute to their formation. Inhibition of DNA-PK, a key NHEJ component, by NU7026 resulted in a significant decrease in radiation-induced chromatid exchanges in hESCs but not in somatic cells. In contrast, NU7026 treatment increased the frequency of radiation-induced breaks to a similar extent in pluripotent and somatic cells. Thus, DNA-PK dependent NHEJ efficiently participates in the elimination of radiation-induced chromatid breaks during the late G2 in both cell types and DNA-PK activity leads to a high level of misrejoining specifically in pluripotent cells.
