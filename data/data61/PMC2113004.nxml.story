The functions of the light-harvesting complex of photosystem II (LHC- II) have been studied using thylakoids from intermittent-light-grown (IML) plants, which are deficient in this complex. These chloroplasts have no grana stacks and only limited lamellar appression in situ. In vitro the thylakoids showed limited but significant Mg2+-induced membrane appression and a clear segregation of membrane particles into such regions. This observation, together with the immunological detection of small quantities of LHC-II apoproteins, suggests that the molecular mechanism of appression may be similar to the more extensive thylakoid stacking seen in normal chloroplasts and involve LHC-II polypeptides directly. To study LHC-II function directly, a sonication- freeze-thaw procedure was developed for controlled insertion of purified LHC-II into IML membranes. Incorporation was demonstrated by density gradient centrifugation, antibody agglutination tests, and freeze-fracture electron microscopy. The reconstituted membranes, unlike the parent IML membranes, exhibited both extensive membrane appression and increased room temperature fluorescence in the presence of cations, and a decreased photosystem I activity at low light intensity. These membranes thus mimic normal chloroplasts in this regard, suggesting that the incorporated LHC-II interacts with photosystem II centers in IML membranes and exerts a direct role in the regulation of excitation energy distribution between the two photosystems.
