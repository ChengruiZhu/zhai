Nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma (NPNEC) is a poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma and a rare type of pancreatic cancer. Computed tomography (CT)-based imaging is currently the most effective method for diagnosing and classifying NPNEC. The present study investigated the clinical features and CT manifestations of this disease. The CT manifestations and clinical data of 13 patients with NPNEC, confirmed by surgery or needle biopsy, were retrospectively analyzed. None of the 13 patients exhibited endocrine-related symptoms and a single lesion with a variable position in the pancreatic was observed in all patients. The tumors were generally round or irregular, with inhomogeneous density and an average diameter of 7.45±3.92 cm (range, 4.0–16.0 cm). Cystic necrosis zones were observed in 5 patients and calcification was observed in 2. A total of 4 patients exhibited intrahepatic metastases, and 2 patients demonstrated spleen and colon invasion. Enhanced scanning indicated that tumors were markedly enhanced. There were 11 cases of middle or high-grade enhancement (84.6%) and 2 cases of mild enhancement (15.4%). Marked envelope enhancement was observed in 3/11 patients with high-grade enhancement. In conclusion, the majority of patients with NPNEC lacked characteristic manifestations. While the CT examination revealed certain characteristics, histological analysis was necessary to confirm diagnoses.
