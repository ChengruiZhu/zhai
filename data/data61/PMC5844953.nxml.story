Neuronal differentiation involves extensive modification of biochemical and morphological properties to meet novel functional requirements. Reorganization of the mitochondrial network to match the higher energy demand plays a pivotal role in this process. Mechanisms of neuronal differentiation in response to nerve growth factor (NGF) have been largely characterized in terms of signaling, however, little is known about its impact on mitochondrial remodeling and metabolic function. In this work, we show that NGF-induced differentiation requires the activation of autophagy mediated by Atg9b and Ambra1, as it is disrupted by their genetic knockdown and by autophagy blockers. NGF differentiation involves the induction of P-AMPK and P-CaMK, and is prevented by their pharmacological inhibition. These molecular events correlate with modifications of energy and redox homeostasis, as determined by ATP and NADPH changes, higher oxygen consumption (OCR) and ROS production. Our data indicate that autophagy aims to clear out exhausted mitochondria, as determined by enhanced localization of p62 and Lysotracker-red to mitochondria. In addition, we newly demonstrate that NGF differentiation is accompanied by increased mitochondrial remodeling involving higher levels of fission (P-Drp1) and fusion proteins (Opa1 and Mfn2), as well as induction of Sirt3 and the transcription factors mtTFA and PPARÎ³, which regulate mitochondria biogenesis and metabolism to sustain increased mitochondrial mass, potential, and bioenergetics. Overall, our data indicate a new NGF-dependent mechanism involving mitophagy and extensive mitochondrial remodeling, which plays a key role in both neurogenesis and nerve regeneration.
