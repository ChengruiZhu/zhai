The large majority of the available dysphagia screening tools has been developed for the stroke population. Only few screening tools are suitable for heterogeneous groups of patients admitted to a subacute care unit. The Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital (RBWH) dysphagia screening tool is a nurse-administered, evidence-based swallow screening tool for generic acute hospital use that demonstrates excellent sensitivity and specificity. No Italian version of this tool is available to date. The aim of this study was to determine the reliability and screening accuracy of the Italian version of the RBWH (I-RBWH) dysphagia screening tool. A total of 105 patients consecutively admitted to a subacute care unit were enrolled. Using the I-RBWH tool, each patient was evaluated twice by trained nurses and once by a speech and language pathologist (SLP) blind to nurses' scores. The SLP also performed standardised clinical assessment of swallowing using the Mann assessment of swallowing ability (MASA). During the first and the second administration of the I-RBWH by nurses, 28 and 27 patients, respectively, were considered at risk of dysphagia, and 27 were considered at risk after SLP assessment. Intra- and inter-rater reliability was satisfactory. Comparison between nurse I-RBWH scores and MASA examination demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of the I-RBWH dysphagia screening tool up to 93% and 96%, respectively; the positive and negative predictive values were 90% and 97%, respectively. Thus, the current findings support the reliability and accuracy of the I-RBWH tool for dysphagia screening of patients in subacute settings. Its application in clinical practice is recommended.
