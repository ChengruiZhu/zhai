The influence of alkaline and the neutral grade of magnesium aluminometasilicate as a porous solid carrier for the liquid self-emulsifying formulation with ibuprofen is investigated. Ibuprofen is dissolved in Labrasol, then this solution is adsorbed on the silicates. The drug to the silicate ratio is 1:2, 1:4, and 1:6, respectively. The properties of formulations obtained are analyzed, using morphological, porosity, crystallinity, and dissolution studies. Three solid self-emulsifying (S-SE) formulations containing Neusilin SG2 and six consisting of Neusilin US2 are in the form of powder without agglomerates. The nitrogen adsorption method shows that the solid carriers are mesoporous but they differ in a specific surface area, pore area, and the volume of pores. The adsorption of liquid SE formulation on solid silicate particles results in a decrease in their porosity. If the neutral grade of magnesium aluminometasilicate is used, the smallest pores, below 10 nm, are completely filled with liquid formulation, but there is still a certain number of pores of 40–100 nm. Dissolution studies of liquid SEDDS carried out in pH = 1.2 show that Labrasol improves the dissolution of ibuprofen as compared to the pure drug. Ibuprofen dissolution from liquid SE formulations examined in pH of 7.2 is immediate. The adsorption of the liquid onto the particles of the silicate causes a decrease in the amount of the drug released. Finally, more ibuprofen is dissolved from S-SE that consist of the neutral grade of magnesium aluminometasilicate than from the formulations containing the alkaline silicate.
