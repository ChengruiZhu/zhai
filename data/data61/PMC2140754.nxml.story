 The ester-hydrolyzing or lipase actions of extracts of whole rats whose ages ranged from 3 days before birth to 3 years 15 days were tested on ten simple esters by the method described in previous papers. The results are presented in the form of curves, both as absolute actions and as relative actions on the different substrates. The "pictures" of the relative actions changed progressively with increasing age of the rat. For the embryo and the youngest rats, the curves approached those given by the Flexner-Jobling rat carcinoma and by a number of tumors of human origin, changing to a type characteristic of the adult rat, and appearing to revert again to some extent to the embryonic type for the oldest rats. The changes in the actions on individual esters and the relative changes in the actions on different esters are discussed in detail. The greatest increases in actions as the rats became older were found with methyl and ethyl butyrates; at the same time that the actions on some of the other esters were also found to change in characteristic ways. Similar experiments with the protease actions of the extracts of whole rats of different ages on three protein preparations did not give differences similar to those found for the lipase actions. The probable reasons for these observed differences in the two sets of enzyme actions are discussed.
