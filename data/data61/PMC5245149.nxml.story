S100A6 is involved in regulating the progression of cancer. S100A6 can regulate the dynamics of cytoskeletal constituents, cell growth and differentiation by interacting with binding or target proteins. The present study investigated whether S100A6 affects cell proliferation in gastric cancer cells by stimulating several downstream factors. Firstly, the expression and localization of S100A6 were investigated using immunohistochemical staining, an immunoelectron microscopy and laser confocal scanning. A ChIP-Chip assay was performed to determine the downstream factors of S100A6 using promoter Chip analysis, including approximately the âˆ’800 to +200 regions around the transcription starting point. Polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed to confirm this. It was found that the intensity of S100A6 staining was markedly higher in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and its expression level correlated with that of the Ki67 protein. The overexpression of S100A6 also promoted cell proliferation in AGS and BGC823 cell lines, detected using a Cell Counting-Kit 8 assay. In cells overexpressing S100A6, the expression levels of interleukin (IL)-8, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)5, CDK4, minichromosome maintenance complex component 7 (MCM7) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) were noticeably increased. In conclusion, the increased expression of S100A6 promoted cell proliferation by regulating the expression levels of IL-8, CDK5, CDK4, MCM7 and Bcl2 in gastric cancer cells.
