Factors contributing to chronic postoperative pain (CPOP) are poorly defined in young people and developmental considerations are poorly understood. With over 5 million children undergoing surgery yearly and 25% of adults referred to chronic pain clinics identifying surgery as the antecedent, there is a need to elucidate factors that contribute to CPOP in surgical patients. The present study includes patients undergoing hip preservation surgery at a children’s hospital. The HOOS and SF-12 Health Survey were administered to 614 pre-surgical patients with 421 patients completing follow-up (6-months, 1-year and 2-years post-surgery). Pain, quality of life, and functioning across time were examined for each group within the population. A three trajectory model (low pain, pain improvement and high pain) emerged indicating three categories of treatment responders. Pain trajectory groups did not differ significantly on gender, pre-surgical age, BMI, prior hip surgery, surgical type, joint congruence or Tönnis grade. The groups differed significantly from each other on pre-surgical pain, pain chronicity, quality of life and functioning. Those in the high pain and pain improvement groups endorsed having pre-surgical depression at significantly higher rates and lower pre-surgical quality of life compared to those in the low pain group (
