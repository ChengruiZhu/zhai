Renal transplantation (RTx) is the best therapeutic modality for patient suffering from end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Deceased donor organ transplantation (DDOT) accounts for <4% of RTx in India. We report 4 years single centre experience on DDOT vis-à-vis patient/graft survival, graft function in terms of serum creatinine (SCr), rejection episodes, and delayed graft function in 160 DDOT. Between January 2006 to December 2009, 160 RTx from 89 donors were performed, of which 25.2% were expanded criteria donors. Majority of the donors were brain dead due to road traffic/cerebrovascular accidents. The commonest recipient diseases leading to ESRD were chronic glomerulonephritis (49%), diabetes mellitus (10%), and benign nephrosclerosis (10%). Mean recipient/donor age was 35.6±14.68 and 44.03±18.19 years. Mean dialysis duration pretransplantation was 15.37±2.82 months. Mean cold ischemia time was 5.56±2.04 hours. All recipients received single dose rabbit-anti-thymocyte globulin induction and steroids, mycophenolate mofetil/calcinueurin inhibitor for maintenance of immunosuppression. Delayed graft function was observed in 30.6% patients and 14% had biopsy proven acute rejection. Over mean follow-up of 2.35±1.24 years, patient and graft survival rates were 77.5% and 89.3% with mean SCr of 1.40±0.36 mg/dl. DDOT has acceptable graft/patient survival over 4 years follow-up and should be encouraged in view of organ shortage.
