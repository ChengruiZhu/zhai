 gene maps to a tumor suppressor locus at chromosome 3p14. Although correlation studies have indicated that FOXP1 has a role in tumor suppression, determination of the regulatory mechanism of FOXP1 is required to establish its function in breast cancer. It has previously been identified that FOXP1 is regulated by estrogen in breast cancer and that treatment with bisphenol A is effective for regulating the transformation of the normal human breast epithelial cell line, MCF-10F. In addition, FOXO-regulated activation of FOXP1 inhibits the apoptosis of MCF-10F cells following tamoxifen and Akt inhibitor VIII administration. The present study indicates that FOXP1 regulation occurs via a PI3K/Akt/p70S6 kinase (p70S6K) signaling pathway. Following treatment with wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells demonstrated decreased FOXP1 protein expression levels; this result was also observed in the small interfering (si)RNA silencing of Akt. By contrast, overexpression of Akt resulted in increased FOXP1 protein expression levels in the MDA-MB-231 cells compared with the control cell lysates. Furthermore, treatment with rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin/p70S6K cascade, resulted in decreased FOXP1 expression in the MCF7 cells, but not in the MDA-MB-231 cells, which were resistant to rapamycin-induced inhibition. In addition, silencing of p70S6K using siRNA produced a marked decrease in FOXP1 expression. These data indicate that FOXP1 protein expression is regulated by a PI3K/Akt/p70S6K signaling cascade in breast cancer.
