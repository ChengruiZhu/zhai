The effect of alteration in the concentration of internal Mg on the rate of ouabain binding to reconstituted human red blood cell ghosts has been evaluated as well as the effect of Mgi on Na:Na compared to Na:K exchange. It was found that the dependence of the rate of ATP- promoted ouabain binding on the combined presence of Nai and Ko which occurs at high [Mg]i is lost when the concentration of Mgi is lowered. The sensitivity of the external surface for Ko is also changed since Ko can now inhibit the ouabain binding rate in the absence of Nai; on the other hand Nao at low [Mg]i can stimulate ouabain binding indicating that the relative affinity of the outside surface for Nao has either increased or that for Ko has decreased or both. Thus the effects of changes in [Mg]i result in a change in the side-dependent actions of Na and K and emphasize the possible difficulties of interpreting results obtained on systems lacking sidedness. Mgi was found to be required for Pi-promoted ouabain binding and that the inhibitory action of Nai increased as [Mg]i was increased. In addition, Ca was found to be most effective in inhibiting the rate of ATP-promoted ouabain binding when Na and K were present together than when either was present alone. Na:K exchange was found to be more sensitive to the concentration of Mgi than Na:Na exchange; at low [Mg]i Na:K exchange could be stimulated without changing the extent of Na:Na exchange. These results are consistent with the idea that conformational states of the pump complex are directly influenced by [Mg]i.
