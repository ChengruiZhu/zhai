The genome-protecting role of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) has identified PAR polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and PAR glycohydrolase (PARG), two enzymes responsible for the synthesis and hydrolysis of PAR, as chemotherapeutic targets. Each has been previously individually evaluated in chemotherapy, but the effects of combination PARP-1 and PARG inhibition in cancer cells are not known. Here we determined the effects of the inhibition of PARP-1 and the absence or RNAi knockdown of PARG on PAR synthesis, cell death after chemotherapy and long-term viability. Using three experimental/clinical PARP-1 inhibitors in PARG-null cells, we show decreased levels of PAR and increased short-term and long-term viability with each inhibitor, with the exception of DPQ. Treatment with the experimental chemotherapeutic agent, N-methyl-Nâ€™-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), led to increased cell death in PARG-null cells, but decreased cell death when pretreated with each PARP-1 inhibitor. Similar results were observed in MNNG-treated HeLa cells, where RNAi knockdown of PARG or pretreatment with ABT-888 led to increased HeLa cell death, whereas combination PARG RNAi knockdown + ABT-888 failed to produce increased cell death. The results demonstrate the ability of the PARP-1 inhibitors to decrease PAR levels, maintain viability and decrease PAR-mediated cell death after chemotherapeutic treatment in the absence of PARG. Further, the results demonstrate that the combination of PARP-1 and PARG inhibition in chemotherapy does not produce increased HeLa cell death. Thus, the results indicate that inhibiting both PARP-1 and PARG, which both are chemotherapeutic targets that increase cancer cell death, does not lead to synergistic cell death in HeLa cells. Therefore, strategies that target PAR metabolism for the improved treatment of cancer may be required to target PARP-1 and PARG individually in order to optimize cancer cell death.
