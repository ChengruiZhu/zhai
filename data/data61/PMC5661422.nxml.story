 analysis. Cerulenin was used as a FASN inhibitor. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were used to detect expression levels of FASN and ErbB1-4. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of FASN and ErbB1-4 in 58 invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC), as well as their association with clinicopathological characteristics. The expression of FASN and ErbB1-4 in MCF-7-MEK5 cells and tumor tissues increased significantly compared with controls (P<0.001). Inhibition of FASN by cerulenin resulted in a significant decrease in expression of ErbB1, 2 and 4 (P<0.001), whereas there was no evident change in ErbB3. In IDC samples, the expression of FASN and ErbB1-4 increased considerably in lymph node metastases compared with non-lymph node metastases (P<0.05). ErbB2 expression increased in advanced clinical stages (II, III and IV) of IDC and in tumors with larger diameters (P<0.05). The expression of ErbB3 increased in ER-positive tumors (P<0.05). Additionally, a positive association between the expression of FASN and ErbB1, 2 and 4 was observed (P<0.05). FASN activates ErbB1, 2 and 4, and their dimers, which are polymerized via the microstructural domain of the cell membrane. This may initiate EMT and consequentlyincrease the invasion and migration of cancer cells. However, ErbB3 may also affect tumor progression via a FASN-independent pathway.
