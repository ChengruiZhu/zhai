We examined the prognostic value of normal levels of four serum cancer markers, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate associated antigen (CA19-9), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and cancer antigen 125 (CA125), in gastric cancer patients. Among 1927 gastric cancer patients enrolled in this study, 1477 were male (76.6%) and 450 were female (23.4%). The median age was 57 years (range 20-86). Clinicopathological features and survival times were recorded, and the association between CEA, CA19-9, AFP, and CA125 levels and patient prognosis was analyzed. The optimal cut-off values were 0.71 for CEA (P=0.317), 9.22 for CA19-9 (P=0.009), 3.76 for AFP (P=0.008) and 15.65 for CA125 (P=0.006). Serum CA19-9 levels correlated with gender, age, and tumor depth (all P<0.05); AFP levels correlated with pathological type (P=0.005); and CA125 levels correlated with gender, tumor size, pathological type, tumor depth and lymph node metastasis (all P<0.05). Relatively high levels of CA19-9, AFP and CA125, still within the normal range, were all associated with poor prognosis (5-year overall survival: 70.6% vs 64.2%, P<0.001. 69.6% vs 54.5%, P=0.011. 70.2% vs 54.9%, P<0.001). However, only CA19-9 and AFP levels were independent prognostic predictors. We conclude that the combined assessment of CA19-9, AFP and CA125 levels could have prognostic value in gastric cancer (P<0.001).
