We evaluated the dye 4',5'-dimethyl-5-(and -6-) carboxyfluorescein (Me2CF) for determining the intracellular pH(pHi) of isolated, perfused proximal tubules of the salamander. The intracellular absorbance spectrum, corrected for the intrinsic absorbance of the tubule, was obtained once per second. The dye was incorporated into tubule cells by exposing them to the membrane-permeable precursor 4',5'-dimethyl-5- (and -6-) carboxyfluorescein diacetate. The introduction of the dye had no significant effect on either pHi or cell voltage transients. Compared with dye contained in a cuvette, intracellular dye had a peak absorbance that was red-shifted by approximately 5 nm, and an apparent pK that was increased by approximately 0.3. These differences precluded an accurate calculation of pHi by the comparison of intracellular spectra with in vitro calibration spectra. However, when Me2CF was calibrated intracellularly, using the K-H exchanger nigericin to equalize external pH and pHi, the dye-derived, steady state pHi was within approximately 0.1 of the value obtained with pH-sensitive microelectrodes. Furthermore, when pHi was simultaneously measured with dye and microelectrodes during rapid pHi transients, the pHi time courses measured by the two methods were very similar. We conclude that the intracellular absorbance spectrum of Me2CF can be used to measure steady state pHi and rapid pHi transients reliably, provided the dye is calibrated intracellularly.
