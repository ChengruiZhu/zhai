Flattening filter‐free (FFF) beams produce higher dose rates. Combined with compensator‐based intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) techniques, the dose delivery for each beam can be much shorter compared to the flattened beam MLC‐based or flattened beam compensator‐based IMRT. This ‘snap shot’ IMRT delivery is beneficial to patients for tumor motion management. Due to softer energy, superficial doses in FFF beam treatment are usually higher than those from flattened beams. Due to no flattening filter, thus less photon scattering, peripheral doses are usually lower in FFF beam treatment. However, in compensator‐based IMRT using FFF beams, the compensator is in the beam pathway. Does it introduce beam hardening effects and scattering such that the superficial dose is lower and peripheral dose is higher compared to FFF beam MLC‐based IMRT? This study applied Monte Carlo techniques to investigate the superficial and peripheral doses in compensator‐based IMRT using FFF beams and compared it to the MLC‐based IMRT using FFF beams and flattened beams. Besides varying thicknesses of brass slabs to simulate varying thicknesses of compensators, a simple cone‐shaped compensator was simulated to mimic a clinical application. The dose distribution in water phantom by the cone‐shaped compensator was then simulated by multiple MLC‐defined FFF and flattened beams with varying apertures. After normalization to the maximum dose, D
