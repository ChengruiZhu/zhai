Labral hypertrophy is a distinct feature in hip dysplasia. Occasionally, very small, hypotrophic labra are observed. However, there is no literature concerning this pathology. We investigated if the size of the labrum correlated with any radiologic parameters reflecting the amount of acetabular coverage. It was hypothezised that there is a negative correlation between labrum size and acetabular coverage. Labra were categorized into three groups depending on the relation between length of the articular sided surface and height of bony attachment. Labra with a height:length ratio of 2 were classified as hypotrophic, with a height:length ratio of 1 as normal and with a ratio of 0.5 as hypertrophic. Labral cross-sectional areas (CSA) were measured on radial magnetic resonance imaging-arthrography slices using the measuring tool of the PACS system of 20 hips with hypotrophic labra (group 1), 20 hips with normal labral appearance (group 2) and 10 hips with hypertrophic labra (group 3). These values were then analyzed against following parameters: neck-shaft-angle (NSA), lateral center-edge angle (LCE), acetabular index (AI), femoral extrusion index (FEI) and acetabular retroversion index (ARI). Analyses of variance were used to determine differences in mean values between the three groups. Mean labral CSA differed significantly between all groups (group 1: 12.1 ± 2.9 mm
