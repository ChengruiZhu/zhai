Despite advances in cytotoxic chemotherapy and targeted therapies, 5-year survival rates remain low for patients with advanced breast cancer at diagnosis. This highlights the limited effectiveness of current treatment options. An improved understanding of cellular functions associated with the development and progression of breast cancer has resulted in the creation of a number of novel targeted molecular therapies. However, more work is needed to improve outcomes, particularly in the first-line recurrent or metastatic hormone receptor–positive breast cancer setting. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is a major intracellular signaling pathway that is often upregulated in breast cancer, and overactivation of this pathway has been associated with primary or developed resistance to endocrine treatment. Clinical data from the Phase III Breast Cancer Trials of Oral Everolimus-2 (BOLERO-2) study of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus combined with exemestane in hormone receptor–positive advanced breast cancer were very promising, highlighting the potential role of mTOR inhibitors in combination with endocrine therapies as a first-line treatment option for these patients. It is hoped that the use of mTOR inhibitors combined with current standard-of-care endocrine therapies, such as aromatase inhibitors, in the first-line advanced breast cancer setting may result in greater antitumor effects and also delay or reverse treatment resistance.
