Runners often experience over-use injuries. Ground reaction force (GRFs) patterns have been associated with these over-use injuries; however, it is not solely the magnitude of GRFs, but also the rate at which they are applied that lead to lower extremity injury. Many recreational runners will use over-the-counter insoles as a method of treating or preventing injury. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of two insoles on peak GRFs and loading rates. It was hypothesized that no differences in peak GRFs or loading rates would exist with the addition of two insoles during running. Twelve subjects (7 females; 5 males) performed seven running trials in each of the following conditions: no insoles (NORM), over-the-counter insoles (OTC) and memory-foam insoles (TEMPUR). GRFs were recorded using a force plate (1440Hz; AMTI) while subjects ran across a 15 meter lab. A 2 x 3 (gender x insole) repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare the effects of insoles on loading rate and ground reaction forces. Alpha level was set at p <0.05. The current study found no statistical differences in loading rate or GRFs between the insole and no insole conditions. Furthermore, there was no gender effect in any condition. The findings of the current study suggest that insoles do not attenuate shock or decrease loading rate. The lack of shock attenuation associated with insoles suggests they do not protect the lower extremity from injury.
