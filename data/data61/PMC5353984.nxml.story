Diabetes is one of the most common metabolic diseases in the world. Vitamin E reduces protein glycation and improves insulin sensitivity, while cumin is effective in remission of diabetes. Therefore this study was designed to evaluate the effects of vitamin E and cumin essential oil, on the blood level of leptin,glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) and also on lipid profile in diabetic patients.In this double blind clinical trial, 95 diabetic patients were selected and randomly dividedinto three groups.The first group received cumin essential oil in capsule form. The second group received Vitamin E, and the third group was used ascontrol receiving oral gelatin capsules as placebo for three months period.Blood glucose, lipid profile, apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), apolipoprotein B (ApoB), leptin, HbA1c, oxidized LDL (oxLDL), and paraoxonase1 activity were measured. The results showed reduction in oxLDL and significant increase in paraoxonase 1 in Vitamin E group by the end of the third month period (P<0.05). Cumin group showed decrease in blood glucose, HbA1C, triglyceride, leptin and ox-LDL. ApoA1 and paraoxonase1 were also increased by cumin treatment (P<0.05).Diabetic complications may have been reduced by intake of Vitamin E and cumin essential oil. Cumin in comparison with vitamin E has broader impact and it is more beneficial in terms of ability to reduce the diabetic index.
