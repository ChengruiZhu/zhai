Recent genome-wide association studies have identified multiple variants that confer risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). However, established associations explain only a part of the heritability. Thus, even at the genome-wide association studies era, candidate gene approach should be still useful. Recent interventional studies against the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) showed reduction in new onset of DM, implying the system is involved in the onset. We substantiated the hypothesis that genetic variants of RAS have significant association with prevalence of DM. We enrolled to the study consecutive 782 subjects who had consulted our hospitals for mainly lifestyle related diseases. They consisted of 282 (36.1 %) diabetes cases. Genotypes were assayed with genomic DNA for conventional four genes of the RAS, i.e., angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion variant, angiotensinogen (AGT) M235T variant, angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1) A1166C variant, and aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) C-344T variant. Association between the genetic variants of the RAS and prevalence of type 2 DM was tested. A significant association of DM and CYP11B2 genotype was obtained. There was no significant association between DM and ACE, AGT and AT1 variants. A multivariate logistic regression showed that age, gender, and CYP11B2 genotype were independent factors for association to diabetes, the DM risk of CC/CT to TT being 1.40 (95 % CI 1.04–1.90,
