Patients suffering from schizophrenia show specific cognitive deficits. One way to study these cognitive phenomena works with the presentation of ambiguous stimuli. During viewing of an ambiguous stimulus, perception alters spontaneously between different percepts. Percept changes occur as single events during continuous presentation, whereas during intermittent presentation, percept changes occur at regular intervals either as single events or bursts. Here we investigate perceptual responses to continuous and intermittent stimulation in healthy control subjects and patients with schizophrenia. Interestingly, the response patterns can be highly variable but show systematic group differences. We propose a model that connects these perceptual responses to underlying neuronal processes. The model mainly describes the activity difference between competing neuronal populations on different neuronal levels. In a hierarchical manner, the differential activity generates switching between the conflicting percepts as well as between states of higher and lower perceptual stability. By fitting the model directly to empirical responses, a high variety of patterns can be reproduced, and group differences between healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia can be captured. This helps to link the observed group differences to potential neuronal mechanisms, suggesting that patients with schizophrenia tend to spend more time in neuronal states of lower perceptual stability.
