Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family member 3 (WASF3) is required for invasion and metastasis in different cancer cell types, and has been demonstrated to possess prognostic value in various types of human cancer. However, to the best of our knowledge, the expression profile of WASF3 and its correlations with the clinicopathological features of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have not yet been described. In the present study, the mRNA expression levels of WASF3, in 38 NSCLC patients and in matched normal tissues, were assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and the protein expression in 96 specimens was analyzed using immunohistochemistry. In addition, patient survival data were collected retrospectively and the association between WASF3 expression and five-year overall survival was evaluated. The results demonstrated that the mRNA expression level of WASF3 in cancer tissues was markedly (approximately five times) higher compared with that of the normal tissues. The WASF3 protein expression profile in NSCLC was consistent with the mRNA expression result, which also correlated with the histological subtype and tumor stage. Furthermore, patients with WASF3-positive expression were associated with a poorer prognosis compared with those exhibiting WASF3-negative expression, and the five-year survival rate was 20.8 and 46.5%, respectively (Kaplan-Meier; log-rank, P=0.004). In the multivariate analysis, which included other clinicopathological features, WASF3 emerged as an independent prognostic factor (relative risk, 0.463; 95% CI, 0.271â€“0.792). These results indicate that WASF3 may be critical in the pathogenesis of NSCLC, in addition to being a valuable prognostic factor for NSCLC patients. Further investigations are required to identify the efficacy of WASF3 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of NSCLC.
