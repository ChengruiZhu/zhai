The survey was completed by 13 out of 22 emergency departments (59% participation rate), and six out of 13 respondents (46%) completed the entire survey. The factors reported as having an influence on a hospital’s decision to submit data for syndromic surveillance were: public health importance of events (6 respondents) and assurance of privacy/confidentiality (5 respondents). The majority of respondents (5 respondents) reported that there are no factors that limit their ability to send emergency department data. Among hospitals that did report factors that limit their ability to send data, lack of information technology support in the hospital (2 respondents) and manually entering data/lack of electronic health records (1 respondent) were the most frequently reported. Six out of seven hospitals who answered (86°%) reported the current method of sharing syndromic surveillance data on a weekly basis, including a statewide data summary, as useful. Respondents also recommended that data be shared back with participants using 30-day line graphs for each syndrome (4 respondents). The three syndromes respondents found most useful were influenzalike illness (7 respondents), gastrointestinal (5 respondents), and respiratory (5 respondents). The three syndromes respondents found least useful were the broad heat syndrome (4 respondents), the narrow heat syndrome (4 respondents), and the other syndrome that captures all visits not classified into any syndrome (4 respondents). Chief complaint data, which is used to classify emergency department visits into syndromes, is most often recorded by a drop-menu (4 respondents).
