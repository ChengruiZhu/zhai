A gene duplication provides an extra gene copy that can be free to accumulate mutations and gain a new function. Therefore, gene duplication plays a very important role in evolution. However, the presence of an additional gene copy can sometimes be deleterious because it can lead to an excessive dosage relative to those of its interacting partners. This dosage imbalance effect in turn influences the fate of duplicated genes in evolution. Our study gives the first description to our knowledge of the molecular/structural basis for the dosage imbalance effect. We study the relationships between gene family size and extent of protein under-wrapping, a molecular quantifier of the reliance of the protein on binding partnerships to maintain structural integrity, indicative of the extent of structure protection from disruptive hydration. Using more than 12,000 protein three-dimensional structures from six organisms that range from bacteria to human, we show an inverse relationship between extent of protein under-wrapping and family size. That is, a duplication is unlikely to be tolerated if the protein is highly under-wrapped (i.e., its structure requires substantial stabilizing interactions with other proteins). We also show that the effect of dosage imbalance is more apparent in unicellular organisms but is buffered to some extent in higher eukaryotes.
