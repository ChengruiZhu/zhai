While selective-serotonin reuptake
inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants
are commonly prescribed in the treatment of depression, their use
during pregnancy leads to fetal drug exposures. According to recent
reports, such exposures could affect fetal development and long-term
offspring health. A central question is how pregnancy-induced physical
and physiological changes in mothers, fetuses, and the placenta influence
fetal SSRI exposures during gestation. In this study, we examined
the effects of gestational stage on the maternal pharmacokinetics
and fetal disposition of the SSRI (±)-citalopram (CIT) in a mouse
model. We determined the maternal and fetal CIT serum concentration–time
profiles following acute maternal administration on gestational days
(GD)14 and GD18, as well as the fetal brain drug disposition. The
results show that pregnancy affects the pharmacokinetics of CIT and
that maternal drug clearance increases as gestation progresses. The
data further show that CIT and its primary metabolite desmethylcitalopram
(DCIT) readily cross the placenta into the fetal compartment, and
fetal exposure to CIT exceeds that of the mother during gestation
2 h after maternal administration. Enzymatic activity assays revealed
that fetal drug metabolic capacity develops in late gestation, resulting
in elevated circulating and brain concentrations of DCIT at embryonic
day (E)18. Fetal exposure to the SSRI CIT in murine pregnancy is therefore
influenced by both maternal gestational stage and embryonic development,
suggesting potential time-dependent effects on fetal brain development.
