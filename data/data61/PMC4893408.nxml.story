Recent studies demonstrate that glial glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) upregulation attenuates visceral nociception. The present work further characterized the effect of ceftriaxone- (CTX-) mediated GLT-1 upregulation on visceral hyperalgesia. Intrathecal pretreatment with dihydrokainate, a selective GLT-1 antagonist, produced a reversal of the antinociceptive response to bladder distension produced by CTX. The hyperalgesic response to urinary bladder distension caused by intravesicular acrolein was also attenuated by CTX treatment as was the enhanced time spent licking of abdominal area due to intravesicular acrolein. Bladder inflammation via cyclophosphamide injections enhanced the nociceptive to bladder distension; cohorts administered CTX and concomitant cyclophosphamide showed reduced hyperalgesic response. Cyclophosphamide-induced bladder hyperalgesia correlated with a significant 22% increase in GluR1 AMPA receptor subunit expression in the membrane fraction of the lumbosacral spinal cord, which was attenuated by CTX coadministration. Finally, neonatal colon insult-induced hyperalgesia caused by intracolonic mustard oil (2%) administration at P9 and P11 was attenuated by CTX. These studies suggest that GLT-1 upregulation (1) attenuates the hyperalgesia caused by bladder irritation/inflammation or by neonatal colonic insult, (2) acts at a spinal site, and (3) may produce antinociceptive effects by attenuating GluR1 membrane trafficking. These findings support further consideration of this FDA-approved drug to treat chronic pelvic pain syndromes.
