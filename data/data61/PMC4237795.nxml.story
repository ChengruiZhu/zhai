miRNA expression profiles in dMSCs from five patients with severe PE and five healthy pregnant women were screened using microarray. Then, bioinformatic analysis of the microarray results was performed. Out of 179 differentially expressed miRNAs, 49 miRNAs had significant (p < 0.05) differential expression of ≥ 2.0-fold changes, including 21 up-regulated and 28 down-regulated. miRNA-Gene-network and miRNA-Gene ontology (GO) -network analyses were performed. Overall, 21 up-regulated and 15 down-regulated miRNAs showed high degrees in these analyses. Moreover, the significantly enriched signaling pathways and GOs were identified. The analyses revealed that pathways associated with cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and immune functions were highly regulated by the differentially expressed miRNAs, including Wnt signaling pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, transforming growth factor beta signaling pathway, T-cell receptor signaling pathway, and B cell receptor signaling pathway. Four miRNA predicted target genes, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, suppression of cytokine signaling 3, and serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A 55 kDa regulatory subunit B α isoform (PPP2R2A) were all decreased in dMSCs from patients with PE. Furthermore, the physiological roles of miR-16 and miR-136 in the down-regulation of VEGFA and PPP2R2A, respectively, were confirmed through reporter assays.
