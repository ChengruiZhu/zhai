Gastric cancer (GC) is a highly aggressive and life-threatening malignancy. Even with radical surgical removal and front-line chemotherapy, more than half of GCs locally relapse and metastasize at a distant site. The dismal outcomes reflect the ineffectiveness of a one-size-fits-all approach for a highly heterogeneous disease with diverse etiological causes and complex molecular underpinnings. The recent comprehensive genomic and molecular profiling has led to our deepened understanding of GC. The emerging molecular classification schemes based on the genetic, epigenetic, and molecular signatures are providing great promise for the development of more effective therapeutic strategies in a more personalized and precise manner. To this end, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) research network conducted a comprehensive molecular evaluation of primary GCs and proposed a new molecular classification dividing GCs into four subtypes: Epstein-Barr virus-associated tumors, microsatellite unstable tumors, genomically stable tumors, and tumors with chromosomal instability. This review primarily focuses on the TCGA molecular classification of GCs and discusses the implications on novel targeted therapy strategies. We believe that these fundamental findings will support the future application of targeted therapies and will guide our efforts to develop more efficacious drugs to treat human GCs.
