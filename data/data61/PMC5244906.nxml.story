The effects between minimally invasive percutaneous laser ablation and open surgery in the treatment of children with osteoid osteoma were compared in the present study. A total of 72 cases of children with osteoid osteoma were divided into control and observational groups, containing 36 cases in each group. The control group underwent conventional open surgery while the observational group underwent minimally invasive CT guided percutaneous laser ablation. Effects of both operations were compared. The operation duration, blood loss and plaster fixation duration of the observational group were significantly less than those of the control group. The postoperative pain score (VAS) at 1 day and 7 days were significantly lower than that of the control group, the differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). The lesion resection rate, effective rate of bone hyperplasia, effective rate of swelling and effusion and total effective rate of the observational group were significantly higher than those of the control group, the differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). Incidence of adverse reactions of observational group was significantly lower (P<0.05) than that of the control group. However, the difference was not significant when comparing 1-year recurrence rate for the two groups. The minimally invasive percutaneous laser ablation has better surgery effects compared with open surgery in the treatment of children with osteoid osteoma.
