. The recombinant enzyme showed optimal activity at 50Â°C and pH 6.0. The enzyme produced unsaturated disaccharide (UDP2) and trisaccharide fractions as the final main alginate digests. Primary substrate preference tests and further structure identification of various size-defined final oligosaccharide products demonstrated that Aly1 is a bifunctional alginate lyase and prefers G to M. Tetrasaccharide-size fractions are the smallest substrates, and M, G, and UDP2 fractions are the minimal product types. Remarkably, Aly1 can vary its substrate-degrading modes in accordance with the terminus types, molecular sizes, and M/G contents of alginate substrates, producing a series of small size-defined saturated oligosaccharide products from the nonreducing ends of single or different saturated sugar chains and yielding unsaturated products in distinct but restricted patterns. The action mode changes can be partially inhibited by fluorescent labeling at the reducing ends of oligosaccharide substrates. Deletion of the noncatalytic region (NCR) of Aly1 caused weak changes of biochemical characteristics but increased the degradation proportions of small size-defined saturated M-enriched oligosaccharide substrates and unsaturated tetrasaccharide fractions without any size changes of degradable oligosaccharides, thereby enhancing the M preference and enzyme activity. Therefore, our results provided insight into the variable action mode of a novel bifunctional endolytic alginate lyase to inform accurate enzyme use.
