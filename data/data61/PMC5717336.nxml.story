² = |0.19–0.45|, false discovery rate < 5%). Pairs of these miRNAs and their predicted target mRNAs showing expressing levels associated with the identical traits were examined to understand how immune and metabolic traits are affected by miRNA-mediated regulatory networks derived by mapping miRNA abundance as an expression quantitative trait. In total, 221 miRNA-expression-QTL correspond to 164 SNPs and 108 miRNAs, including miR-34a, miR-30e, miR-148-3p, miR-204, miR-181-5p, miR-143-5p and let-7 g that also correlate with the biomarkers. Sixty-one SNPs were simultaneously associated with 29 miRNA and 41 mRNA species. The expression levels of 13 out of 29 miRNA were correlated with one of the biochemical or haematological traits. For example, the expression levels of miR-34a were correlated with serum phosphorus and cholesterin levels; miR-204, miR-15a and miR-16b were correlated with triglyceride. For haematological traits, the expression levels of miR-652 and miR-204 were correlated with the mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration, and the expression of miR-143 was correlated with plateletcrit. Pleiotropic association analyses revealed genetic links between mRNA and miRNA on SSC6 for miR-34a, SSC9 for miR-708 and SSC14 for miR-652. Our analysis of miRNA and mRNA transcript profiles, their correlation with clinically important plasma parameters of hepatic functions as well as information on their genetic regulation provide novel regulatory networks and potential new biomarkers for immune and metabolic traits.
