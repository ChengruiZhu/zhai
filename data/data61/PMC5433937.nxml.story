; house musk shrew) to generate partner cells for cell fusion to produce suncus monoclonal antibodies. Suncus are insectivores that are genetically distant to rodents, and recognize antigens and epitopes that are not immunogenic in mice and rats, which are the animals most commonly used in basic life science research and from which monoclonal antibodies are usually produced. To date, monoclonal antibodies from suncus have not been generated due to the lack of a plasmacytoma fusion partner. To obtain suncus plasmacytoma cell lines suitable as a cell fusion partner, we injected suncus at both sides of the tail base with antigen emulsion, collected the lymph nodes and spleens, and cultured the cells to obtain immortalized lymphoid cell lines visually resembling mouse SP2/0-Ag14 myeloma cells. Three suncus immunized with the antigen provided 4 cell lines of suncus plasmacytoma, but they did not secrete immunoglobulins. Antibody-producing hybrid cells were generated from these cell lines using a cell fusion technique. Using one of the cell lines as a fusion partner, we obtained six lines of immunoglobulin-producing hybrid cells which secreted an unidentified monoclonal IgG. When these 6 lines were used as new fusion partners, we obtained several hybrid cell lines which secreted immunogen-specific monoclonal antibodies. These hybrid cells can be cloned and cryopreserved. We also obtained another good fusion partner which initially secreted antibody but later stopped doing so. These suncus-suncus hybrid cell lines will be useful for the production of suncus monoclonal antibodies.
