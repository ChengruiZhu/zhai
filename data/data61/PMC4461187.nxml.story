Vestimentiferans (Siboglinidae, Polychaeta) live as juveniles and adults in an obligate mutualistic association with thiotrophic bacteria. Since their development is aposymbiotic, metatrochophores of vestimentiferans from the East Pacific Rise colonizing deep-sea hydrothermal vents are infected with the specific symbiont, develop the trophosome, and reduce their digestive system. To gain insight into the anatomy and ultrastructure and to compare this stage with metatrochophores from other siboglinids, we serial sectioned and reconstructed three specimens using light and transmission electron microscopy. The metatrochophore was composed of a prostomium, a small peristomium, two chaetigers (or two chaetigers and one additional segment without chaetae), and a minute pygidium. A digestive system and an intraepidermal nervous system were developed. Larval organs such as the prototroch, the neurotroch, and an apical organ were present, along with juvenile/adult organs such as tentacles, uncini, pyriform glands, and the anlage of the nephridial organ. We propose that in vestimentiferans, the vestimentum is the head arising from the prostomium, peristomium, and the anterior part of the first chaetiger. In frenulates, in contrast, the head is composed on the one hand of the cephalic lobe arising from the prostomium and on the other of the forepart developing from the peristomium and the anterior part of the first chaetiger. In frenulates the muscular septum between the forepart and trunk develops later than the first two chaetigers. Since this septum has no counterpart in vestimentiferans, the forepart-trunk border of frenulates is not considered homologous with the vestimentum-trunk border in vestimentiferans. The obturacular region in vestimentiferans does not appear to be a body region but rather the head appendages arising from the first chaetiger. In contrast, the tentacles in frenulates are prostomial head appendages. In both taxa, the trunk is the posterior part of the first chaetiger, and the opisthosoma is the following chaetigers and the pygidium. Comparisons with other polychaetes suggest that two larval segments are autapomorphic for the monophyletic Siboglinidae.
