Previous gene expression studies have identified factors influencing population-level variation in gene regulation. However, these efforts have been limited to a small set of well-studied populations. By leveraging the high resolution of RNA sequencing and broad population sampling, we survey the landscape of transcriptome variation across a globally distributed set of seven populations that span a breadth of human genetic variation and major dispersal events. We assess differences in gene expression, transcript structure, and regulatory variation. We find only 44 transcripts that show significant differences in expression, likely as a result of the small sample size, but we find that 25% of the variance in gene expression is due to population differences. This is a larger fraction than previously observed, and it is likely due to the greater breadth of human diversity assayed in this study. We also find that population-specific variance is mostly due to transcription variability rather than the configuration of expressed gene products. Additionally, known common regulatory variants have similar effects across populations including those we study here. These data and results serve as a resource cataloging the wide array of gene expression regulation affecting population variation among diverse groups, improving our understanding of transcriptional diversity.
