It has been reported that microRNAs (miRs) can regulate renal response to acute injury and members of them are believed to be important in maintenance of renal function and development of renal injury. We investigated the actions of microRNA-423-5p (miR-423-5p) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) M1 after acute kidney injury. MiR-423-5p was up-regulated and GSTM1 was down-regulated in human kidney (HK-2) cells subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) and in rat kidneys subjected to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Dual luciferase assays revealed miR-423-5p binding to the 3â€² untranslated region of GSTM1. Proliferation was lower and apoptosis, ER stress and oxidative stress were all higher in H/R-treated HK-2 cells transfected with or without miR-423-5p mimics and GSTM1 siRNA than in the same cells transfected with miR-423-5p inhibitors and a GSTM1 expression vector. Increased miR-423-5p and decreased GSTM1 mRNA and protein levels were observed in rat kidneys on days 1, 2 and 7 after I/R. Levels had normalized by days 14 and 21. On day 3 after treatment, rats receiving I/R or I/R plus miR-423-5p mimics exhibited higher serum creatinine and urea nitrogen levels than rats receiving I/R plus a miR-423-5p inhibitor. MiR-423-5p and lower GSTM1 mRNA and protein levels were higher in the I/R and I/R plus miR-423-5p mimic groups than in the I/R plus miR-423-5p inhibitors group. These findings demonstrate that after acute kidney injury, miR-423-5p induces ER stress and oxidative stress by inhibiting GSTM1and suppresses repair.
