There are several methods for measuring activity in the living human brain. Here, we studied functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which depends on the vascular response to neuronal activity, and surface field potentials, which measure electrical activity from many neurons. These two widely used measurements of human brain activity often provide different and potentially conflicting results. We propose a quantitative model for how these two measurements integrate activity from neuronal populations. The fMRI signal is highly sensitive to the average level of local neuronal activity but not the degree of synchrony between neurons. In contrast, the field potential is most sensitive to synchronous neuronal signals. Our model accounts for several observations seen in fMRI and field potential data: some very large features of field potential recordings, such as gamma oscillations, can occur with little to no associated fMRI signal. The model predicts this because the gamma oscillations result more from increased neuronal synchrony than increased neuronal activity. Other field potential signals, such as broadband changes, which are likely driven by the level of neuronal activity rather than a change in synchrony, are highly correlated with fMRI. The two measures thus provide complementary information about human brain activity.
