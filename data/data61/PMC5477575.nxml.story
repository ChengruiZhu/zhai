Placental insufficiency jeopardizes prenatal development, potentially leading to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and stillbirth. Surviving fetuses are at an increased risk for chronic diseases later in life. IUGR is closely linked with altered trophoblast and placental differentiation. However, due to a paucity of mechanistic insights, suitable biomarkers and specific therapies for IUGR are lacking. The transcription factor p45 NF-E2 (nuclear factor erythroid derived 2) has been recently found to regulate trophoblast differentiation in mice. The absence of p45 NF-E2 in trophoblast cells causes IUGR and placental insufficiency in mice, but mechanistic insights are incomplete and the relevance of p45 NF-E2 for human syncytiotrophoblast differentiation remains unknown. Here we show that p45 NF-E2 negatively regulates human syncytiotrophoblast differentiation and is associated with IUGR in humans. Expression of p45 NF-E2 is reduced in human placentae complicated with IUGR compared with healthy controls. Reduced p45 NF-E2 expression is associated with increased syncytiotrophoblast differentiation, enhanced glial cells missing-1 (GCM1) acetylation and GCM1 desumoylation in IUGR placentae. Induction of syncytiotrophoblast differentiation in BeWo and primary villous trophoblast cells with 8-bromo-adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP) reduces p45 NF-E2 expression. Of note, p45 NF-E2 knockdown is sufficient to increase syncytiotrophoblast differentiation and GCM1 expression. Loss of p45 NF-E2 using either approach resulted in CBP-mediated GCM1 acetylation and SENP-mediated GCM1 desumoylation, demonstrating that p45 NF-E2 regulates post-translational modifications of GCM1. Functionally, reduced p45 NF-E2 expression is associated with increased cell death and caspase-3 activation
