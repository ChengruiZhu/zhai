Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry were performed to investigate the influence of human nonmetastatic clone 23 type 1 (nm23-H1), a metastasis-associated gene on proteomic alterations in cancer cells of the uterine cervix. It was validated by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. The expression of voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) was increased in nm23-H1 gene silenced SiHa or CaSki cervical cancer cells. The clinical implication was shown that cervical cancer tissues with positive VDAC1 immunoreactivity exhibited deep stromal invasion (>10 mm in depth) and large tumor size (> 4 cm in diameter). Cervical cancer patients with positive VDAC1 immunoreactivity displayed higher recurrence and poorer overall survival than those with negative VDAC1. Silencing of VDAC1 reduced cell proliferation and migratory ability. Mitochondrial membrane potential was decreased and reactive oxygen species generation was increased in the VDAC1 gene-silenced cervical cancer cells. Cell cycle progression and autophagy were not changed in VDAC1 silencing cells. The cytotoxicity of cisplatin was significantly enhanced by knockdown of cellular VDAC1 and the compounds that interfere with hexokinase binding to VDAC. Therapeutic strategies may be offered using VDAC1 as a target to reduce cell growth and migration, enhance the synergistic therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin and reduce cisplatin dose-limiting toxicity.
