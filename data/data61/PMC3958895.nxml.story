Lipid metabolites regulate fatty acid and glucose homeostasis. The intention of the current study is to identify circulating lipid species, which are altered in rodent obesity and strongly correlate with the classically measured metabolites glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol. Mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) for 14 weeks have increased body weight and fasting glucose. Serum triglycerides are not altered, while cholesterol tends to be increased. Accordingly, major cholesteryl ester (CE) species and free cholesterol are not significantly raised in obesity while minor metabolites, including CE 20:3 and CE 18:3, are increased or reduced, respectively. Distinct sphingomyelin (SM) species are elevated while ceramides are not raised. Phosphatidylinositol (PI) species, including PI 34:1, are raised while others are decreased. PI 34:1 strongly correlates with fasting glucose and proinsulin levels. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) 26:0, 40:2, and 40:5, which are induced in obesity, correlate with cholesterol. PC 38:4 and PC 40:6 are also raised in fat fed mice and positively correlate with fasting glucose. Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) species are also changed in obesity and the already shown reduction of LPC 16:1 has been confirmed. LPC 22:4, which is increased, correlates with serum cholesterol. The data indicate that circulating levels of various lipid species are changed in the obesity model studied and some of them are strongly associated with classically measured metabolites.
