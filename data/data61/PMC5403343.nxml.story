Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-associated mortality in Western countries. CRC treatment is dependent on the preoperative and postoperative condition of patients. At present, the prognostic value of conventional parameters for the estimation of patient prognosis is limited. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of karyopherin Î±2 (KPNA2) in cancerous and healthy colon tissues and to evaluate the prognostic factors for patients with primary CRC. KPNA2 expression in CRC and paired normal tissues was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). In addition, serum KPNA2 expression was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Subsequently, the association between KPNA2 expression in CRC tissues and patient clinicopathological features was analyzed. Kaplan-Meier analysis was utilized to investigate the prognostic value of KPNA2 expression on overall survival rates following radical surgery for the treatment of CRC. Immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR revealed that KPNA2 expression was significantly increased in CRC tissues compared with paired normal tissues. Serum KPNA2 expression was significantly increased in CRC patients compared with healthy individuals. Furthermore, KPNA2 expression was observed to positively correlate with Tumor-Node-Metastasis stage, lymph node involvement, tumor differentiation, infiltration depth, lymphovascular invasion and perineural invasion, which are factors known to affect the prognosis of CRC patients following surgery. In addition, increased KPNA2 expression was associated with decreased overall survival and disease-free survival rates. Patients not suited for surveillance regimens may be identified at initial biopsy test with a positive KPNA2 immunohistochemistry. Increased serum expression of KPNA2 may be utilized as a diagnostic factor for patients with CRC. High nuclear KPNA2 expression may serve as a novel predictor of survival following radical colorectal surgery in CRC patients. The results of the present study may improve individualized risk stratification, leading to the optimization of therapies for CRC patients.
