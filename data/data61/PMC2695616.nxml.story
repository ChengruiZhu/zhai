The prevalence of tobacco consumption, including chewing + smoking, were 45% (n = 623) among men and 15% (n = 125) among women decedents. However, smoking was observed in 20% and tobacco chewing in 30% of male decedents, while only 6% of female decedents smoked and 10% chewed tobacco. Social class had no impact on tobacco consumption in men but did influence one subgroup >55 years among women, ie, among those who had the highest tobacco consumption. Tobacco intakes were significantly more common among decedents dying due to circulatory, malignant, and pulmonary diseases, compared with other causes (men 61.1%, 76.6%, pulmonary 77.3% vs 31%, P < 0.001; women 27.5%, 75.9%, pulmonary 24.6% vs 0.42%, P < 0.001) of mortality, respectively. Pulmonary causes included chronic bronchitis and asthma. Circulatory diseases (29.1%, n = 646) including heart attacks (10.0%), stroke (7.8%), valvular heart disease (7.2%, n = 160), sudden cardiac death and inflammatory cardiac disease, each (2.0%, n = 44) were the second most common causes of deaths, after infections (41.1%, n = 915). Malignant neoplasm (5.8%, n = 131), injury (14.0%, n = 313), and miscellaneous causes of deaths, including diabetes mellitus (2.2%, n = 49) were noted in 9.1%, (n = 202) of death records. Cancers of the lung (1.6%), oral cavity (1.5%), liver (1.1%), stomach (0.9%), breast (0.31%), uterus, cervix, and ovary (0.27%) were relatively common causes for deaths due to malignancy.
