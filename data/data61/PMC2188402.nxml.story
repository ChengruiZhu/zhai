The results of this study show that during growth of the immunogenic Meth A fibrosarcoma, two different types of suppressor T lymphocytes are generated in sequence. One type is generated during early tumor growth, reaches peak number around day 6, and is progressively lost thereafter. It is defined by its ability, upon passive transfer, to suppress the expression of a DTH reaction to tumor antigens in tumor- immunized recipients. It bears the Ly1-,2+ membrane phenotype and is sensitive to relatively low doses of cyclophosphamide. In contrast, the second type of suppressor cell is not detected until after day 9 of tumor growth, and is defined by its ability to inhibit, upon passive transfer, the expression of adoptive immunity against an established tumor in T cell-deficient recipients. According to previous studies it bears the Ly1+,2-, L3T4a+ membrane phenotype and is less sensitive to cyclophosphamide than the T cell suppressor of DTH. It is argued that this second type of suppressor T cell seems likely to be responsible for the escape of immunogenic tumors from antitumor immunity, because it can suppress the expression of a powerful mechanism of antitumor immunity in recipient mice, and is generated progressively as the tumor- bearing host loses concomitant immunity. In contrast, although the Ly-1- ,2+ T cell suppressors of DTH can efficiently suppress a DTH reaction to an implant of living tumor cells, they fail to suppress the expression of immunity to the same implant.
