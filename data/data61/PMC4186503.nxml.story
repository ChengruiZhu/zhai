Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes may be a manifestation of antitumor immunity. In the present study, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and pericancerous non-tumor liver tissues samples were obtained from 86 surgical patients who had not received preoperative treatment. The cellular expression levels of CD4 and CD8 were immunohistochemically examined in the two tissue groups using tissue microarrays, to evaluate their clinicopathological relevance. Immunohistochemically, CD4 and CD8 T cells were observed in the tumor parenchyma and tumor stroma, and the intensity of CD4 and CD8 immunoreactivity was homogeneous in all HCC samples examined. Morphometrically, the average numbers of CD4- and CD8-positive T cells were significantly increased in the tumor stroma, compared with those in the tumor parenchyma (tumor stroma versus tumor parenchyma: 22±3.6 versus 7.4±0.9 in CD4, 32.8±4.2 versus 16±2.5 in CD8; both P<0.01). Furthermore, the average numbers of CD8-positive T cells in the tumor parenchyma and stroma were significantly increased, compared with the average numbers of CD4-positive cells (P<0.05). In addition, in the tumor parenchyma and stroma, the average numbers of CD8 T cells were significantly higher in patients with tumor diameters ≤5 cm compared with those in patients with tumor diameters >5 cm (diameter ≤5 cm versus diameter >5 cm: 18.1±3.3 versus 12.2±3.8 in tumor parenchyma, 36.5±4.8 versus 21.9±8.9 in tumor stroma; both P<0.05). In addition, CD8 expression was significantly enhanced in patients with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis, compared with paired tumor parenchymal tissues (P<0.01). Furthermore, a significant positive correlation was observed between CD4 and CD8 expression in the tumor parenchyma and stroma (both P<0.001). These observations suggest that tumor parenchyma- or stroma-infiltrating CD8 T cells may be involved in HCC tumor diameter control.
