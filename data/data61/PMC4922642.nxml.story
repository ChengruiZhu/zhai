The intestinal tract undergoes many changes during development, and after birth it has to significantly elongate and widen in order to increase the surface area for absorption. Crypt fission is a key process in intestinal tissue expansion and is also involved in adenoma growth. Despite the importance of crypt fission, the mechanisms controlling it are poorly understood. Understanding how crypt fission is regulated in normal tissue can help us to determine how the process changes in cancer. Here, we describe cellular behaviour during crypt fission. We identify a specific cellular arrangement in the intestinal stem cell niche that is associated with crypt fission and reveals insights into the mechanisms controlling crypt fission. There are two different cell types at the crypt base, Lgr5+ and Paneth cells, which play distinct roles in this process. We find that both their location and differences between them in proliferation, stiffness, and adhesion are important for fission. Based on our data, we propose a model in which stiffer and more adhesive Paneth cells are necessary to shape the crypt base and establish where fission occurs, whereas softer Lgr5+ cells allow shape changes and proliferation to expand newly formed crypts. Our model is an important step in understanding how crypt fission is initiated in normal tissue and provides a framework to understand how the process changes in tumorigenesis.
