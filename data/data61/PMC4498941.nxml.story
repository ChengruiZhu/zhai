Chitosan is a widely used biocompatible biomaterial in the tissue regeneration, but its utility and application in the tissue morphogenesis of salivary gland remains unclear. The study aimed to explore the effects of chitosan on the epithelial morphogenesis of submandibular gland (SMG). With chitosan, the branching morphogenesis of the whole SMG explant was facilitated, and the morphogenetic-promoting effects of mesenchymal tissue on SMG were further enhanced. Furthermore, chitosan was competent to induce recombined SMG epithelium to form branches in the serum-free condition independently. In the presence of chitosan, the morphogenetic efficacy of mesenchyme-derived growth factors responsible for epithelial morphogenesis including fibroblast growth factors 7, fibroblast growth factor 10 and hepatocyte growth factor increased. The specific epithelial phenotype induced by individual growth factor, which was required for the accomplishment of salivary epithelial morphogenesis, was promoted by chitosan. Moreover, the proliferative and the chemotactic properties of these growth factors towards the SMG epithelia were also reinforced by chitosan. Therefore, in orchestrating and intensifying the essential mesenchyme-derived growth factors, chitosan is versatile in mediating SMG epithelium to form a predetermined phenotype more efficiently and comprehensively. This study suggested that chitosan is a morphogenetic-regulating biomaterial for salivary tissue, which might be useful for the future salivary gland investigation and regeneration.
