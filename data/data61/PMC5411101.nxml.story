Genetically identical cells, even when they are exposed to the same environmental conditions, display incredible diversity. Gene expression noise is attributed to be a key source of this phenotypic diversity. Transcriptional dynamics is a dominant source of expression noise. Although scores of theoretical and experimental studies have explored how noise is regulated at the level of transcription, most of them focus on the gene specific, cis regulatory elements, such as the number of transcription factor (TF) binding sites, their binding strength, etc. However, how the global properties of transcription, such as the limited availability of TFs impact noise in gene expression remains rather elusive. Here we build a theoretical model that incorporates the effect of limiting TF pool on gene expression noise. We find that competition between genes for TFs leads to enhanced variability in mRNA copy number across an isogenic population. Moreover, for gene copies sharing TFs with other competitor sites, mRNA variance as a function of the mean shows distinct imprints for one gene copy and multiple gene copies respectively. This stands in sharp contrast to the universal behavior found in mean expression irrespective of the different scenarios of competition. An interesting feature of competition is that introduction of competitor sites can transform a unimodal mRNA distribution into a multimodal distribution, which could lead to phenotypic variability.
