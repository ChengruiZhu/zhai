Studies indicate secreted cathepsins are involved in metastasis. V-ATPases, which are necessary for activating intracellular cathepsins, also play a role in metastasis and are targeted to the plasma membrane of metastatic breast cancer cells. We are interested in a connection between cell surface V-ATPases, activation of secreted cathepsins and the metastatic phenotype of MDA-MB231 cells. We investigated whether V-ATPase inhibition would reduce the activity of secreted cathepsin B and cathepsin L. Using cell lysates and conditioned media, we measured cathepsin B and L activity within and outside of the cells. We found different forms of cathepsin B and L were secreted representing the pre-pro, pro and active forms of the proteases. Cathepsin B activity was higher than cathepsin L in conditioned media and in cell lysates. V-ATPase inhibition by concanamycin A decreased cathepsin B activity in conditioned media and significantly decreased cathepsin B activity in cell lysates. Cathepsin L activity showed a slight decrease in cell lysates. Changes in the activity of secreted and intracellular cathepsins following V-ATPase inhibition were supported by changes in the amounts of pro and active forms of cathepsin B in conditioned media and cathepsins B and L in cell lysates. Overall, our data shows that inactive forms of cathepsins B and L are secreted from the MB231 cells and V-ATPase activity is important for the activation of secreted cathepsin B. This indicates a connection between cell surface V-ATPases in metastatic breast cancer cells and the function of secreted cathepsin B.
