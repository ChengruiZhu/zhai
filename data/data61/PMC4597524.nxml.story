69 shoulders (38 men, 29 women, 2 bilateral) with a mean age of 52 years (range, 20-74) underwent arthroscopic treatment for PT supraspinatus tears. There were 2 complications (2.9%): 1 shoulder developed axillary nerve symptoms and 1 developed a superficial wound infection. 8 of the 69 shoulders (11.6%) underwent subsequent surgery on the index shoulder unrelated to the rotator cuff before final follow-up and were omitted from the outcomes analysis. 24/61 shoulders had bursal-sided tears (39.3%) and 37/61 had articular-sided tears (60.7%). 31 shoulders (50.8%) had a tear involving <25% of the tendon thickness. 35 tears (57.4%) were repaired whereas 26 tears (42.6%) underwent debridement alone. 28 shoulders also had proximal biceps tendon lesions (45.9%), 28 had SLAP tears (45.9%) and 18 had other pathologies. Treatment failure occurred in 4 shoulders (6.6%) and they were subsequently removed from outcomes analysis. 57 shoulders had a mean follow-up of 41.3 months (range, 24.0-74.2 months). All postoperative outcomes scores and pain scores improved significantly over preoperative baselines (p<0.05) (Table 1). ASES scores returned to levels of age-matched normals. Tears that underwent debridement only demonstrated significantly worse QuickDASH scores compared to the rest of the cohort (mean 12.0 [SE 4.3] versus mean 7.8 [SE 2.1]; p<0.05) whereas shoulders that underwent acromioplasty demonstrated significantly improved QuickDASH scores compared to the rest of the cohort (mean 6.8 [SE 2.1] versus mean 13.6 [SE 3.5]; p=0.026).
