The still largely obscure molecular events in the glioblastoma oncogenesis, a primary brain tumor characterized by an inevitably dismal prognosis, impel for investigation. The importance of Long noncoding RNAs as regulators of gene expression has recently become evident. Among them, H19 has a recognized oncogenic role in several types of human tumors and was shown to correlate to some oncogenic aspects of glioblastoma cells. Here we, hypothesyze that in glioblastoma H19 exerts its function through the interaction with the catalytic subunit of the PRC2 complex, EZH2. By employing a factor analysis on a SAGE dataset of 12 glioblastoma samples, we show that H19 expression in glioblastoma tissues correlates with that of several genes involved in glioblastoma growth and progression. H19 knock-down reduces viability, migration and invasiveness of two distinct human glioblastoma cell lines. Most importantly, we provide a mechanistic perspective about the role of H19 in glioblastoma cells, by showing that its expression is inversely linked to that of NKD1, a negative regulator of Wnt pathway, suggesting that H19 might regulate NKD1 transcription via EZH2-induced H3K27 trimethylation of its promoter. Indeed, we showed that H19 binds EZH2 in glioblastoma cells, and that EZH2 binding to NKD1 and other promoters is impaired by H19 silencing.
