To the best of our knowledge, the clinical implications of using ribonucleoside reductase subunit M1 (RRM1) in patients who undergo curative resection and adjuvant chemotherapy have not been established. In the present study, the clinical data from 101 consecutive patients who underwent macroscopically curative resection, and who received adjuvant gemcitabine chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer at the Kanagawa Cancer Centre (Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan) between April 2005 and December 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. The association between the RRM1 status and survival and clinicopathological features were assessed. Of the 101 patients, 41 patients expressed high levels of RRM1 expression (40.6%). Although a significant difference was observed in lymphatic invasion, there was no difference between the two groups with regard to any other clinicopathological parameters. The median follow-up period was 67.3 months. There was a significant difference between the recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates at 5 years after surgery, which were 12.9 and 0% in the high RRM1 and low RRM1 groups, respectively (P=0.042). Furthermore, there was a significant difference in the 5-year overall survival (OS) rates following surgery, which were 5.1 and 21.5% in the high RRM1 and low RRM1 groups, respectively (P=0.015). The results of the present study indicated that out of the factors assessed, RRM1 was the most important prognostic factor for OS and RFS in patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent curative resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine. Adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine alone may be insufficient for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, particularly in patients with relevant risk factors.
