In posttranslational translocation in yeast, completed protein substrates are transported across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane through a translocation channel formed by the Sec complex. We have used photo-cross-linking to investigate interactions of cytosolic proteins with a substrate synthesized in a reticulocyte lysate system, before its posttranslational translocation through the channel in the yeast membrane. Upon termination of translation, the signal recognition particle (SRP) and the nascent polypeptideâ€“associated complex (NAC) are released from the polypeptide chain, and the full-length substrate interacts with several different cytosolic proteins. At least two distinct complexes exist that contain among other proteins either 70-kD heat shock protein (Hsp70) or tailless complex polypeptide 1 (TCP1) ring complex/chaperonin containing TCP1 (TRiC/CCT), which keep the substrate competent for translocation. None of the cytosolic factors appear to interact specifically with the signal sequence. Dissociation of the cytosolic proteins from the substrate is accelerated to the same extent by the Sec complex and an unspecific GroEL trap, indicating that release occurs spontaneously without the Sec complex playing an active role. Once bound to the Sec complex, the substrate is stripped of all cytosolic proteins, allowing it to subsequently be transported through the membrane channel without the interference of cytosolic binding partners.
