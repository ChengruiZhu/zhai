The study has enrolled 17 patients (8 smokers), 50% of whom were females. Mean age was 38.59 years old (standard deviation, 7.4). The mean number of cigarettes smoked in the smoker group was 26.14 (11.29) cigarettes/day and the mean age when tobacco first began was 15.14 (2.04) years. We have not been able to show any significant differences in TNF-α levels according to age or weight. For the whole series we have not found any significant influence of gender in TNF-α levels, but after dividing the series in smokers and nonsmokers, we have shown higher levels of TNF-α in serum (5.59 [0.26] pg/mL vs 5.56 [0.37] pg/mL; nonsignificant [NS]) and EBC (4.94 [0.41] pg/mL vs 4.22 [0.36] pg/mL; p = 0.031) in male smokers. On the other hand, nonsmoking females showed slightly higher TNF-α levels in serum (5.70 [0.50] pg/mL vs 5.42 [0.29] pg/mL; NS) and EBC (4.54 [0.92] vs 4.11 [0.41 pg/mL]; NS). Smokers had higher TNF-α levels in EBC (4.46 [0.58] pg/mL vs 4.34 [0.62] pg/mL; NS), while serum TNF-α levels were slightly higher in nonsmokers (5.52 [0.56] pg/mL vs 5.50 [0.27] pg/mL; NS). We have not demonstrated any association between tobacco consumption and TNF-α levels. We have not shown any significant relation between pulmonary function and the studied parameters, with only a modest association between forced expiratory volume at one second and forced vital capacity and TNF-α levels in EBC.
