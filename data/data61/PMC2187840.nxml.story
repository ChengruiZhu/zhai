We used mAbs against polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) surface proteins to investigate the mechanisms by which stimulated human neutrophils (PMNs) adhere in vitro to laminin, the major glycoprotein of mammalian basement membrane. mAb IB4, which is directed against the common beta 2 chain of the CD11/CD18, only partially inhibited the adherence of PMA- stimulated PMNs to both laminin and to subendothelial matrices. In contrast, IB4 completely inhibited PMA-stimulated PMN adherence to gelatin, fibronectin, collagen IV, and endothelial cell monolayers. PMA- stimulated PMNs from a patient with severe congenital CD11/CD18 deficiency also adhered to laminin, but not to gelatin or endothelial cell monolayers. Therefore, PMA-stimulated PMNs adhere to laminin by both CD11/CD18-dependent and CD11/CD18-independent mechanisms. Expression of CD11/CD18-independent adherence to laminin was agonist dependent, occurring after stimulation with the calcium ionophore A23187 and recombinant TNF-alpha, but not with the chemotactic factors FMLP, platelet activating factor, or recombinant human C5a. Expression of CD11/CD18-independent adherence was also divalent cation dependent, occurring in the presence of Mg2+ but not Ca2+ as the sole added divalent cation. The mAbs AIIB2 and 13, which are directed against the beta 1 subunit of the VLA integrins, significantly inhibited the CD11/CD18-independent adherence of normal PMNs to laminin, and completely abolished the adherence of CD11/CD18-deficient PMNs to laminin. Both anti-beta 1 mAbs bound to PMNs, as demonstrated by flow cytometry, and immunoprecipitated a membrane molecule of Mr 130,000 daltons from 125I-labeled, detergent-solubilized PMNs. These data suggest that human PMNs possess beta 1 and beta 2 classes of integrins, and that both mediate PMN adherence.
