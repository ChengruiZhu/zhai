Duplicated genes, as opposed to singletons, are genes that have additional copies in a genome due to evolutionary mechanisms such as whole genome duplication, homologous recombination or retrotransposition events. Duplicates can have similar functions and thus mask the phenotypic consequences when one copy is mutated. Conversely, the corresponding phenotypes would manifest themselves when mutations occur in singletons, since functional compensation is rare among non-duplicated genes. It would thus be expected that the primary source of monogenic diseases, diseases caused by mutations within a single gene, is singletons. However, the opposite was found to be true. Additionally, we found the functional similarity of duplicated disease genes to be greater than that of duplicated non-disease genes of an equivalent duplication age. So how could the stronger functional compensation among duplicates increase their likelihood to associate with diseases? We propose that due to functional compensation in duplicates, disease-causing mutations are less likely to be removed from a human population in large scale since the phenotypes are masked; however, the functional compensation could be lost in a subpopulation, perhaps due to intrinsic variation in gene expression, and therefore lead to diseases. As a result, the duplicated disease genes are linked to genetic diseases, yet they continue to spread within the human population.
