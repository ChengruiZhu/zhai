) is the main glutamate exporter in malignant brain tumors and as such a relevant drug target for treating deadly glioblastomas (WHO grades III and IV). Recently, two small molecules termed sorafenib (Nexavar) and erastin have been found to efficiently block xCT function. We investigated neuronal morphology, metabolic secretome profiles, synaptic function and cell metabolism of primary hippocampal cultures (containing neurons and glial cells) treated with sorafenib and erastin in clinically relevant concentrations. We found that sorafenib severely damaged neurons already after 24â€‰h of treatment. Noteworthy, also at a lower concentration, where no morphological damage or metabolic disturbance was monitored, sorafenib still interfered with synaptic and metabolic homeostasis. In contrast, erastin-treated neurons displayed mostly inconspicuous morphology and metabolic rates. Key parameters of proper neuronal function, such as synaptic vesicle pool sizes, were however disrupted following erastin application. In conclusion, our data revealed that while sorafenib and erastin effectively inhibited xCT function they also interfered with essential neuronal (synaptic) function. These findings highlight the particular importance of investigating the effects of potential neurooncological and general cancer chemotherapeutics also on healthy neuronal cells and their function as revealed by the SOFA tool.
