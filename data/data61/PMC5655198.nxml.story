Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is one of the most common diseases in the senior men and age plays an important role in the initiation and development of BPH. Mammalian cells primarily use the autophagy-lysosome system to degrade misfolded/aggregated proteins and dysfunctional organelles such as mitochondria and suppress pyroptosis, a type of cell death that stimulates inflammatory responses and growth of other cells around. Peroxiredoxin 3 (PRDX3) is the only mitochondrion-associated member of peroxiredoxin family enzymes that exert their protective antioxidant role in cells through their peroxidase activity. We hypothesized that PRDX3 may inhibit autophagy to activate pyroptosis to induce growth of prostatic epithelial cells. Here we show that PRDX3 maintained the integrity of mitochondria and its depletion led to an enhancement of oxidative stresses. PRDX3-associated and PRDX3-free mitochondria co-existed in the same cells. PRDX3 expressed at higher levels in prostatic epithelial cells in prostate tissues from BPH patients and BPH-representative cell line than in prostate tissues from healthy donors and a cell line representing normal epithelial cells. PRDX3 suppressed autophagy flux and activated pyroptosis to induce inflammatory responses and stimulate the over-growth of prostate tissues. Therefore, higher levels of PDRX3 in prostatic epithelial cells may promote the initiation and development of BPH through autophagy inhibition and pyroptosis activation.
