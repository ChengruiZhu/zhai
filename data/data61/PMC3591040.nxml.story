Mandibular condyle fractures are one of the most frequent injuries of the facial skeleton. The option for open treatment of mandibular condyle fractures has become more favorable since osteosynthesis materials were developed in the past few decades. However, the rigid fixation techniques of treating condyle fractures remain one of the controversial issues in maxillofacial trauma. These injuries are currently treated by plate-screw osteosynthesis and, depending on the case, the bone segments are fixed by one or two miniplates. Several techniques and plate types like adaption miniplates, minidynamic compression plates, resorbable plates and double plates have been evaluated biomechanically in various experimental and clinical studies. The biomechanical and physical behavior of mandibles have been investigated by different approaches. It can be divided into computer biomodels (e.g., finite element analysis) and physical models. Physical models allow testing on a gross level to give fatigue performance and fracture strength. The aim of this article is to carry out a review of the literature which deals with biomechanical evaluation made with physical models of plating techniques of mandibular condyle fracture. Based on the results of these studies, osteosynthesis with two miniplates seems to be the most stable way of treating mandible subcondylar fractures, and PLLA plates were not strong enough compared with metal plates.
