Information on biomarkers of urothelial carcinomas (UC) for clinical decision-making is limited. Here, we newly identified and verified CXCL16 as a promising novel biomarker in urine for high grade and muscle invasive UC in a cross-sectional cohort of 308 UC patients, 126 urological hospital controls, and 50 population controls using antibody arrays and ELISA. Median CXCL16 levels in urine was significantly higher in UC patients (273.2 pg/mg creatinine) compared to hospital (148.1 pg/mg) and population controls (85.1 pg/mg) with a particular preference for high grade (460.8 pg/mg), muscle invasive (535.7 pg/mg) and primary UC (327.8 pg/mg) (all p<0.0001). Group differences were confirmed after adjusting or stratifying for potential clinical and individual characteristics, such as leukocyte counts, haematuria, age, gender, and smoking status. In contrast, CXCL16 showed less discriminating power in low grade (244.3 pg/mg), non-muscle invasive (â‰¤pT1, 251.2 pg/mg) and recurrent UC (203.9 pg/mg). In agreement with its function in immune defence, expression of CXCL16 in tissue samples of primary UC patients (n=53) showed only a weak or no immunoreactivity compared to urological hospital controls (n=32). Expression of CXCR6, the G-protein-coupled receptor of CXCL16, remained unchanged. Our findings suggest that evading the immune defence by shedding cell-surface CXCL16 and its increased elimination in urine is a molecular feature of high grade and muscle invasive UC. Therefore, urinary CXCL16 may serve as a useful, simple and non-invasive tool to identify high-risk UC with increased risk of progression at the molecular level.
