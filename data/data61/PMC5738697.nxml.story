A sixth base, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), is formed by the oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) via the catalysis of the ten-eleven translocation (TET) protein family in cells. Expression levels of 5hmC are frequently depleted during carcinogenesis. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying the depletion of 5hmC expression in gastric cancer cells remains unclear, and further research is required. The present study examined the expression levels of 5mC and 5hmC and the expression levels of TET1 and TET2 in gastric cancer tissues using immunohistochemistry. The results revealed that 5hmC expression levels were markedly lower in gastric cancer tissues compared with corresponding adjacent normal tissues. Furthermore, a decrease in 5hmC expression levels was associated with a decrease in TET1 protein expression levels in gastric cancer tissues. The ectopic expression level of TET1 may increase the 5hmC expression level in gastric cancer cells. In addition, the results revealed that TET1 protein expression was markedly different in regards to subcellular localization, and mislocalization was significantly associated with the depletion of 5hmC expression levels in gastric cancer. Together, the results of the present study indicated that TET1 dysfunction reduces 5hmC expression levels, and this phenomenon may serve a crucial role in gastric cancer progression.
