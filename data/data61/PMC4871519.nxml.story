The Target of Rapamycin (TOR) pathway plays a central role coordinating cell growth and cell division in response to the different cellular environments. This is achieved by TOR controlling various metabolic processes, cell growth and cell division, and in part by the localisation of TOR protein complexes to specific internal endomembranes and compartments. Here, we report a novel role for the SCYL family pseudo-kinase, Ppk32 in restraining TOR signalling when cells experience stresses, which specifically affect endomembranes and compartments where TOR complexes are localised. Cells exposed to endomembrane stress (induced by Brefeldin A), displayed increased cell survival when simultaneously treated with the TOR complex 1 (TORC1) inhibitor, rapamycin, presumably because the reduction in TORC1 signalling slows cellular processes to allow cells sufficient time to recover and adapt to this stress. Importantly cancer, neuro-degeneration and neurological diseases are all associated with stress to the endomembrane protein trafficking system. Our findings suggest that therapeutic rapamycin treatment to reduce TOR signalling and block proliferation of cancer cells, which are inherently experiencing such stress, may have the unintended consequence of enhancing cell survival. It is notable, therefore, that our reported mechanisms to reduce Ppk32 protein levels, likely to be conserved in humans, may represent a way to increase TOR signalling and thus increase cell death of cancer types with inherent stress to these internal membrane systems.
