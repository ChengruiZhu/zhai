Lipid disorders, obesity and overweight are considered one of the most important modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. Population surveys carried out in Poland have demonstrated a tendency for lipid disorders to occur in 70% and overweight and obesity in more than half of Poles. No such studies have been conducted in groups of people with vision impairment so far. Yet, regular involvement of visually impaired people in sports is likely to reduce cardiovascular risk. Therefore, the authors attempted to evaluate the lipid profile and nutritional status of male goalball players. Thirty two blind or visually impaired male goalball players aged 20 to 45 years participated in the study during which somatic variables (BH, BM, WC, VFR, BMI) and the lipid profile (TC, LDL, HDL, TG) were evaluated. Overweight was found in 40.6% of athletes, with obesity being at the level of 9.3%. A high correlation was found between visceral fat and the BMI (r=0.7; p<0.001), as well as between visceral fat and WC (r=0.8; p<0.001). Abnormal total cholesterol levels were recorded for LDL (22% of study participants), HDL (17%) and triglycerides (13%). Lower levels of individual components of lipid profiles (and higher levels for HDL) were found in athletes with a normal BMI. A correlation was found between the BMI and TG (r=0.4, p<0.01), WC and TG (r=0.4, p<0.01), VFR and LDL ( r=0.4, p<0.05) and TG (r=0.5, p<0.001). The percentage of overweight and obese subjects with vision impairment was lower compared to the general population of men in Poland, with a more beneficial lipid profile. Regular physical activity of the study participants is likely to have a positive effect on their health.
