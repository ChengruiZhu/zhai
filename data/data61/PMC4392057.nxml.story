Metastasis in lung cancer portends a poor prognosis, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in lung cancer cells is considered a prerequisite to achieve metastatic potential. Recent studies indicate that BTB/POZ domain-containing protein 7 (BTBD7) regulates EMT-associated proteins in human malignancies and however, the role of BTBD7 in lung cancer have not been identified. In present study, we examined BTBD7 expression status and its association with unfavorable clinical features in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Firstly, we studied the fresh specimens, and found that both mRNA and protein expression levels of BTBD7 in NSCLC tissue were significantly increased compared with the adjacent nontumorous lung tissue. Then, we determined BTBD7 protein expressions in the paraffin-embedded samples from NSCLC patients, and analyzed the relations of BTBD7 expression with clinicopathologic features of the patients. The results showed that incidence of metastasis in patients with positive BTBD7 expression was significantly higher than that in those with negative BTBD7 expression, and the positive BTBD7 expression rate in metastatic cases was significantly higher than that in non-metastatic ones; furthermore, Cox regression analyses revealed that BTBD7 was an independent risk factor for either metastasis or survival in NSCLC patients. Thus, we conclude that BTBD7 contributes to metastasis of NSCLC and BTBD7-positive NSCLC may have a high potential for metastasis and thereby a poor prognosis
