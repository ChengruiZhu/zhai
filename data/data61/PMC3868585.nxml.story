Although transcriptional regulation in stem cells is a very active subject, much less is known about how post-transcriptional mechanisms of gene expression affect stem cells. Here, we use freshwater planarians in order to address this question. Planarians have a striking regenerative capacity driven by a population of pluripotent stem cells, the neoblasts. Control of both proliferation and differentiation is thought to rely heavily on post-transcriptional mechanisms, but their precise role is unknown. Poly(A) tail length regulation is an important mechanism of post-transcriptional control of gene expression as changes can be very rapid, and longer poly(A) tails are linked to increased mRNA stability and translational activity. We investigated the role of the CCR4-NOT complex, the major deadenylating complex in eukaryotes, by knocking down its main scaffolding subunit called Not1. Neoblasts in knock down animals are unable to differentiate and accumulate mRNAs with longer poly(A) tails. Our results show that the CCR4-NOT complex is needed for the targeted degradation of specific mRNAs expressed in stem cells, and the failure of this process likely prevents neoblasts from differentiating. These results reveal a new functional aspect of the CCR4-NOT complex and offer a mechanistic insight into the regulation of planarian stem cells.
