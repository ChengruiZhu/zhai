Measles is a highly infectious disease. Eradication of measles can nevertheless be achieved with vaccination of 90–95% of a population, as shown in theory and practice. In China, however, measles continues to infect thousands of people each year despite vaccination coverage above 95%. This conundrum challenges measles elimination in China and worldwide. Here we characterize the geospatial distribution of measles and epidemic connections among cities across China. Using incidence data reported during 2005–2014 for all 344 cities in China, we show that the municipal burden of measles differed substantially and some cities were highly connected and experienced synchronous outbreaks. We identify 14 cities that experienced endemic transmission during 2005–2010, and 21 transmission clusters, including 6 cross-regional clusters that link the less developed inland regions and the industrial east. We find that three transmission foci coexist in China—cities with large minority populations, inland cities with more emigrants, and mega industrial cities hosting more immigrants—and that migrant workers, connecting the latter two foci, likely facilitate measles transmission across regions. This complex connection, along with the differing disease burden among cities, renders measles elimination challenging in China despite the high overall vaccination rate. Future immunization programs should therefore target these three foci.
