Changes in the strength of synaptic connections between neurons are believed to mediate processes of learning and memory in the brain. A computational theory of this synaptic plasticity was first provided by Donald Hebb within the context of a more general neural coding mechanism, whereby phase sequences of activity directed by ongoing external and internal dynamics propagate in mutually exciting ensembles of neurons. Empirical evidence for this cell assembly model has been obtained in the hippocampus, where neuronal ensembles encoding for spatial location repeatedly fire in sequence at different phases of the ongoing theta oscillation. To investigate the encoding and reactivation of these dual coded activity patterns, we examine a biologically inspired spiking neural network model of the hippocampus with a novel synaptic plasticity rule. We demonstrate that this allows the rapid development of both symmetric and asymmetric connections between neurons that fire at concurrent or consecutive theta phase respectively. Recall activity, corresponding to both pattern completion and sequence prediction, can subsequently be produced by partial external cues. This allows the reconciliation of two previously disparate classes of hippocampal model and provides a framework for further examination of cell assembly dynamics in spiking neural networks.
