To evaluate the feasibility and surgical outcome of video endoscopic inguinal lymphadenectomy (VEIL) using a hypogastric subcutaneous approach, 21 patients with vulvar cancer who underwent this procedure were included in the present study. Between December 2010 and March 2013, 21 consecutive patients with vulvar cancer underwent radical vulvectomy and VEIL using a hypogastric subcutaneous approach. The intraoperative and post-operative results and follow-up data were retrospectively analyzed. No intraoperative complications occurred. The mean duration of surgery for the endoscopic inguinal lymphadenectomies was 130 min (range, 80–180 min), with a mean estimated blood loss of 103 ml (range, 30–350 ml). The mean lymph node yield was 15 (range, 10–22 lymph nodes). The suction drains were removed after a mean duration of 7 days (range, 5–11 days). No skin-related complications were observed in the groin region and a lymphocele was only observed in 1/21 (4.8%) patients. After a mean follow-up period of 17 months (range, 3–31 months), recurrence was found in only one patient. All the patients were alive at the time of publication. Based on our preliminary experience, performing VEIL using a hypogastric subcutaneous approach is a safe and feasible technique for patients with vulvar cancer. These results indicate that this surgical technique may decrease the post-operative morbidity of lymphadenectomy without compromising the therapeutic efficacy. Future prospective studies with a greater sample size and a longer duration of follow-up are required.
