As the most common histologic subtype of lung cancer, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) contributes to a majority of cancer-related deaths worldwide annually. In order to find specific biomarkers of LUAD that are able to distinguish LUAD from other types of cancer so as to improve the early diagnostic and prognostic power in LUAD, we analyzed 10098 tumor tissue samples across 27 TCGA cancer types and identified 112 specific expressed genes in LUAD. Meantime, 8240 LUAD dysregulated genes in tumor and normal samples were identified. Combining with the results of specific expressed genes and dysregulated genes in LUAD, we found there were 70 specific dysregulated genes in LUAD (LUAD-SDGs). Then ROC curve revealed six LUAD-SDGs that may be of strong diagnostic value to predict the existence of cancer (area under curve[AUC] > 95%). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to identify 6 LUAD-SDGs associated with patientsâ€™ prognosis (P-values < 0.001). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was employed to demonstrate that the six LUAD-SDGs were independent prognostic factors. Then, we used the six overall survival (OS)-related LUAD-SDGs constructing a six-gene signature. Multivariate Cox regression analysis suggested that the six-gene signature was an independent prognostic factor of other clinical variables (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.5098, 95%CI = 1.2996-1.7538, P < 0.0001). Based on our findings, we first presented the LUAD-SDGs for LUAD diagnosis and prognosis. Our results may provide efficient biomarkers to clinical diagnostic and prognostic evaluation in LUAD.
