Cells experience stressful conditions in the real world that can threaten physiology. Therefore, organisms have evolved intricate defense systems to protect themselves against environmental stress. Many organisms can increase their stress tolerance at the first sign of a problem through a phenomenon called acquired stress resistance: when pre-exposed to a mild dose of one stress, cells can become super-tolerant to subsequent stresses that would kill unprepared cells. This response is observed in many organisms, from bacteria to plants to humans, and has application in human health and disease treatment; however, its mechanism remains poorly understood. We used yeast as a model to identify genes important for acquired resistance to severe oxidative stress after pretreatment with three different mild stresses (osmotic, heat, or reductive shock). Surprisingly, there was little overlap in the genes required to survive the same severe stress after each pretreatment. This reveals that the mechanism of acquiring tolerance to the same severe stress occurs through different routes depending on the mild stressor. We leveraged available datasets of physical and genetic interaction networks to address the mechanism and regulation of stress tolerance. We find that acquired stress resistance is a unique phenotype that can uncover new insights into stress biology.
