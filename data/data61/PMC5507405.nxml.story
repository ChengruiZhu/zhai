Repeating anatomical units, forming a pattern, are present in different parts of the body. This is particularly obvious in the skin, where the many hair follicles become regularly arranged and fixed in place in the embryo as a pattern of evenly spaced spots. The basis for the formation of such repeating patterns has attracted a number of theoretical explanations. One influential theory is that cells first issue chemical signals to one another to produce a map of the pattern, which they then follow to assemble a structure, like a hair follicle. Alternative theories instead suggest that cells cluster together directly, without reference to a pre-existing map, to drive pattern formation. In this study, we find that a set of chemical signals known to be important for early hair follicle formation form a network capable of producing a patterned template to which cells then respond, moving according to its instructions. This supports the signal-based theory for pattern formation. Strikingly, though, by imposing the conditions of the incipient hair follicle evenly across the entire skin, we reveal that skin cells can also form patterns directly by coalescing, without requiring instructions from a pre-existing pattern. However, this ability of cells to pattern directly is normally subservient to their following of a quickly forming pattern template defined by chemical signals. This work highlights that different ways of making biological patterns can coexist in the same embryonic organ but that one is normally subordinated to the other.
