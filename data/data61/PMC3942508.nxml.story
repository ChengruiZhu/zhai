Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent, with the ability to differentiate into different cell types. Additionally, the immunomodulatory activity of MSCs can downregulate inflammatory responses. The use of MSCs to repair injured tissues and treat inflammation, including in neuroimmune diseases, has been extensively explored. Although MSCs have emerged as a promising resource for the treatment of neuroimmune diseases, attempts to define the molecular properties of MSCs have been limited by the heterogeneity of MSC populations. We recently developed a new method, the subfractionation culturing method, to isolate homogeneous human clonal MSCs (hcMSCs). The hcMSCs were able to differentiate into fat, cartilage, bone, neuroglia, and liver cell types. In this study, to better understand the properties of neurally differentiated MSCs, gene expression in highly homogeneous hcMSCs was analyzed. Neural differentiation of hcMSCs was induced for 14 days. Thereafter, RNA and genomic DNA was isolated and subjected to microarray analysis and DNA methylation array analysis, respectively. We correlated the transcriptome of hcMSCs during neural differentiation with the DNA methylation status. Here, we describe and discuss the gene expression profile of neurally differentiated hcMSCs. These findings will expand our understanding of the molecular properties of MSCs and contribute to the development of cell therapy for neuroimmune diseases.
