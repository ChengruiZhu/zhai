Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a severe pulmonary vascular disease characterized by sustained increase in pulmonary arterial pressure and excessive thickening and remodeling of distal small pulmonary arteries. During disease progression, PAH include increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure, right ventricular (RV) enlargement, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, and smooth muscle hypertrophy in pulmonary arterioles. Several anti-PAH therapies targeting various pathways involved in PAH progression have been approved by the Food and Drug Adminstration. However, many of the currently available anti-PAH drugs suffer from a number of limitations, including short biological half-life, and poor pulmonary selectivity. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) is a potent vasodilator with selectivity toward pulmonary circulation when it is administered via the pulmonary route. However, PGE1 has a very short half-life of 5â€“10 minutes. Therefore, we hypothesized that long-term effect of PGE1 could reduce mal-adaptive structural remodeling of the lung and heart and prevent ventricular arrhythmias in monocrotaline-induced rat model of PAH. Our results revealed that PGE1 reduced ventricular hypertrophy, protein expressions of endothelin-1 and endothelin receptor A, and the expression of fibrosis. These results support the notion that PGE1 can improve the functional properties of RV, highlighting its potential benefits for heart and lung impairment.
