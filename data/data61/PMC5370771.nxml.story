A total of 26 patients(24 women, 2 men) who had unilateral ACL rupture 64.46±9.00 years old(46-81years), 13 had physiotherapy only(mean age 64.46±9.35 years),13 had physiotherapy and kinesiotape(mean age 64.46±9.01 years).The patients in both groups received physiotherapy program (ultrasound with 1 MHz, 1W/cm2 during 5minutes; CPM; strength exercise for quadriceps muscle and cold pack during 15 minute). Kinesiotape was applied to the knee and quadriceps of the patient’s leg using a prescribed application to facilitate muscle performance for the experimental group versus a only physiotherapy group.The patients were treated 20 times for four weeks. Socio-demographic variables (gender, age, body mass index, Kellgren-Lawrence system for classification of knee osteoarthritis, use of analgesic drug, pain during rest and activity (VAS=Visual Analog Scale), range of motion of knee flexion and extansion (universal goniometer), circumference measurements of the knee and the quadriceps muscle (up to 10 cm of patella) were measured at baseline, mid the treatment program and after the treatment program. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 22.0 for Windows.Frequency and percentage (average, standard deviation)were used as descriptive statistics of the study.The Wilcoxon test was used to compare the differences between before and after treatment measurements.The Kruskal Wallis test was used to compare groups.Significance was accepted as p<0.05.
