The pancreas develops from a field of progenitor cells localised in a restricted region of the embryonic endoderm. These progenitor cells proliferate and eventually differentiate to generate the three distinct lineages comprising the endocrine (which include insulin-producing Î² cells), acinar, and ductal cells. The molecular pathways implicated in the early generation of pancreas progenitors and their proliferation are well understood. It is also known that the Notch signalling pathway is implicated in sequential binary cell fate decisions that generate the three lineages; however, other signals that may regulate this process remain unknown. Here, we show that a phospholipid, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1p), generated by the progenitor cells themselves, acts as a signal necessary to define the acinar and endocrine lineage. We observe that in the absence of S1p only duct cells are generated and the survival of pancreas progenitors is compromised. The function of this signalling pathway in the generation of the endocrine cells is two-fold. Firstly, it stabilises yes-associated protein (YAP), a transcriptional gene coactivator known to regulate pancreatic progenitor proliferation, and we show that this stability is necessary for the activation of the endocrine specification program. Secondly, it attenuates Notch signalling, allowing the generation of endocrine and acinar cells. Notch attenuation is necessary for the stabilisation of the transcription factor Ngn3, which is required for the generation of endocrine cells. We conclude that S1p acts as an autocrine signal regulating YAP stabilisation and Notch attenuation to mediate pancreas specification. Understanding lineage allocation and specification in the pancreas will shed light on the origins of pancreatic diseases and may suggest novel therapeutic approaches.
