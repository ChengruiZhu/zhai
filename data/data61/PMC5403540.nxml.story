Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM) that secretes monoclonal paraproteins in the blood serum and urine. Bone marrow MM cells can invade and damage the functions of other tissues and organs, such as the lungs, spleen, liver, pancreas, kidneys and lymph nodes. However, the invasion of MM cells primarily located in the BM to the anterior mediastinum at the site of the thymus is an extremely rare event. The current study reports the case of a 53-year-old female who presented with MM with involvement of the anterior mediastinum. The diagnosis was based on clinical imaging analyses and the results from BM and laboratory examinations, local biopsy pathology and immunohistochemistry. The patient was administered two courses of chemotherapy (epirubicin, dexamethasone and thalidomide). As a result, the tumor reduced in size, but the laboratory examination indicated no significant change. Next, the patient was switched to one course of PAD chemotherapy (bortezomib, epirubicin and dexamethasone). The original tumor was significantly reduced in size following this chemotherapy, and all the indicators improved. The present study suggests that invasion of the thymus by MM may lead to immune disturbance arising from the abnormal thymus gland. In the clinic, extramedullary plasmacytoma in the thymus should be carefully distinguished from thymoma.
