Osteogenesis imperfecta or “brittle bone disease” is a congenital disorder of connective tissue causing the bone to break easily. Around 85–90% of cases are due to autosomal dominant mutations in the genes encoding type I collagen, the major organic component of bone. Genotype–phenotype correlations have shown that quantitative defects of collagen type I lead to mild OI, whereas structural defects show a wide clinical range from mild to perinatal lethal. This may partially be explained by the type of amino acid substitution and the relative location in the domain structure. To fully understand the variability of the clinical manifestation and the underlying pathomechanisms, further investigations are required. Here we provide the first biochemical characterization of a mutation at the signal peptide cleavage site of COL1A1, a domain not yet characterized. By steady-state analysis, we observed reduced production of collagen type I. Furthermore, by pulse-chase analysis we detected delayed secretion and partial intracellular retention of collagen I. In the cellular fraction, the electrophoretic migration was abnormal; however, secreted type I collagen showed a normal migration pattern. The intracellular retention of collagen I was confirmed by immunofluorescent staining. Moreover, transmission electron microscopy of cultured fibroblasts revealed enlargement of ER cisternae. These results further support the hypothesis that mechanisms interfering with ER integrity play an important role in the pathology of severe OI.
