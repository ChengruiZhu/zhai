14 patients (14 knees; 10 right) underwent arthroscopic meniscal repair for hypermobile medial meniscus. Men and women were equally affected; average age was 28 (14-46). The mean duration of symptoms was 18 (2-96) months. Six cases (43 %) had no history of trauma. The most common symptoms were medial joint line pain (n:14), locking (n:9), giving way (n:9), rest pain (n:9) and inability to squat (n:5). The most common clinical findings were medial joint line tenderness (n:11), positive McMurray’s test (n:9), medial retinacular tenderness (n:6), and effusion (n:3). 13 patients were rated as poor by the Lysholm scale; average 52(35-85), average Tegner activity level was 5.6 (3-9). MRI, available for eight patients, did not show any spesific findings. Arthroscopy did not reveal any other lesions to explain the mechanical symptoms. SPSS 16,00 for Windows (Statistical Program for the Social Services Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) program was used for statistical analysis. Continuous variables were defined as mean ± standard derivation. Variables were tested for normal distribution by using the Kolmogorov–Smirnow test. Differences between the groups were assessed by using unpaired t-test or Mann–Whitney U-test instead, if continuous variables did not have normal distribution. Paired sample t-test was used to compare continuous variables (data of Tegner and Lysholm scores, preoperative and at last control). P < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant.
