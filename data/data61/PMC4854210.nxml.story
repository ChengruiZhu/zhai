 studies have suggested the antitumor activities of IL-27 in animal models, whereas clinical observations indicate the link of IL-27 in tumor progression. IL-27 has recently been shown to cause inhibition of proliferation on primary leukemic cells from pediatric patients, but information on its role in human leukemic cell lines is limited. In the present study, we investigated the ability of IL-27 to regulate cell growth and survival of various human leukemic cell lines. Our results showed that in human leukemic cell lines coexpressing both IL-27R chains, IL-27Rα and gp130, IL-27 did not inhibit cell growth, but caused dose-dependent proliferation of the acute myeloid leukemic cell line, OCI-AML5, and the erythroleukemic cell lines, TF-1, UT-7, and UT-7/EPO. Consistent with this, IL-27 promoted cell survival and reduced TNF-α-induced apoptosis of the leukemic cell lines. IL-27 also decreased the responsiveness of the leukemic cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, cytarabine and daunorubicin. We observed that IL-27 induced the activation of STAT1/3 and ERK1/2 in the leukemic cells. Growth stimulation by IL-27 was suppressed by the specific MEK inhibitor, U0126, indicating that IL-27-induced cell proliferation is mainly mediated through the activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. The present study is the first demonstration of the proliferative and antichemotherapeutic properties of IL-27 in human leukemic cell lines, suggesting that IL-27 can play an unfavorable role in tumor growth and can be an important determinant in the chemoresponsiveness of certain subtypes of human leukemia.
