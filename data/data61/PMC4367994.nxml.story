Objectives: The increasing global burden of oral cancer has driven much of the focus of research to the determination of reliable prognostic markers which may have significant effects on survival and the control of post-treatment morbidity. This study was undertaken to evaluate tumour associated tissue eosinophilia (TATE) quantitatively in oral cancer specimens and observe for its possible association with tumour stage, patterns of locoregional recurrence and overall prognosis.
Study Design: 14 patients undergoing surgical resection for primary oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) were subjected to grey scale ultrasonography (USG) to assess tumour dimensions. The findings were compared with the cTNM stage initially documented. TATE was evaluated along the invasive tumour front (ITF) using H & E stained sections of histopathological specimens for 10 continuous high power fields (HPF) and graded as mild, moderate or intense. Patients were followed up over 5 years and observed for patterns of recurrence.
Results: Loco regional recurrence was significantly associated with intense degree of TATE. (p<0.001) cTNM stage as well as USG stage did not correlate with the degree of TATE with p=0.419 and 0.772 respectively. None of the patients with mild/ moderate dysplasia developed locoregional recurrence within the period of follow up.
Conclusions: Analysis of TATE in OSCC patients may provide an early indication of future locoregional recurrence. Identification of an appropriate biopsy site representing the ITF where TATE analysis can be performed may be a simple, inexpensive method of obtaining valuable prognostic information at the time of diagnosis.
