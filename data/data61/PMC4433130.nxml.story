Breast cancer is caused by genetic mutations leading to uncontrollable cell reproduction. During successive proliferations, the progenies of tumour cells acquire further mutations increasing their heterogeneity. Among the tumoural mutated cells, there are some which present specific markers of increased aggressiveness and resistance. Sufficiently skilled cancer cells detach from the mammary epithelial cells, enter the blood vessels becoming circulating tumour cells, and reach the bone tissue where they seed. Breast cancer survival probability is the statistical representation of clinical data describing the times patients will survive after the diagnosis of the disease. Breast cancer survival is strongly correlated to genetic markers which increase the resistance and the invading skills of cancer cells but, it is poorly correlated to the amount of circulating tumour cells. To improve the understanding of the dynamic progression of the disease and assisting biologists in the interpretation of results and in experimental design, we developed a mathematical model encompassing the evolution of cancer cells originated in the breast, passing through the circulatory system, and invading the bone tissue based on survival probabilities of patients with different genetic expressions. The model allows us to strongly correlate the gene expression data of cancer cells with the survival probability by identifying the circulating tumour cells responsible for the formation of metastasis. Survival probabilities generated with the model are a useful tool to identify the presence of hidden markers not yet taken into consideration and study the effects of drugsâ€™ administration.
