 horse erythrocytes into mice suppresses A-cell activity in these mice 24 hr later; a much reduced response to SRBC is obtained when they are given at this time. The response can be partially restored if irradiated spleen cells are given with the SRBC. This observation formed the basis for a quantitative in vivo assay for A cells in which the magnitude of restoration by various suspensions of irradiated cells was used to estimate the A-cell activity of that suspension. A quantitative in vitro assay for A cells was also developed. It was essential for this assay that the total cell number, B-cell number, and T-cell number be kept constant and that only the number of A cells be allowed to vary. Only under these conditions was the response a linear function of the number of A cells added. If the in vivo and in vitro assays are detecting the same class of radiation-resistant cells, the physical properties of the cells active in each assay should be identical. Spleen cells were separated on the basis of both density and sedimentation velocity. Fractions from both separation methods were tested for their content of A cells using both the in vivo and in vitro assays. The density and sedimentation profiles of A cells were similar in both assays. The demonstration that a radiation-resistant cell is required in vivo and that this cell has properties identical to the radiation-resistant cell required in vitro indicates that this cell (the A cell) is directly involved in the initiation of an immune response to erythrocyte antigens.
