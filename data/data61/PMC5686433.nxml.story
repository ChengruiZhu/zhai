The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of calcium channel protein on ovarian cancer cells. The expression of calcium channel protein in normal ovarian cells and ovarian cancer cells was detected by fluorescence quantitative PCR. Subsequently, the ovarian cancer cells were added to calcium channel protein activator media at various concentrations of 0, 1, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 mmol/l. The concentration of calcium ion in different samples was produced, and using an MTT assay, ovarian cancer cell activity in various samples was detected. Finally, a flow cytometer was used to explore the apoptosis rate. It was found that there was a significant difference between the expression of calcium channel protein in normal ovarian tissue and ovarian cancer cells (P<0.05), as well as a significant difference of calcium concentration among various samples (P<0.05). When the concentrations of calcium channel activator were 1, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 mmol/l, the values of the ovarian cancer cell inhibition rates were 4.6, 21.3, 48.3, 67.9, 52.8 and 31.8%, respectively. It showed that the calcium channel activator inhibited the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells to a certain extent, in a dose-dependent manner, especially when the concentration was at 12 mmol/l at which the intracellular calcium concentration was similar to that in normal ovarian cells. In conclusion, calcium ions play an important role in promoting cell proliferation of ovarian cancer cells, and they were involved in apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells to some extent, which regulates apoptosis by controlling the content of intracellular calcium.
