 With a technique of preselecting the mitotic cell in the living state for subsequent electron microscopy, it has been possible to examine the ultrastructure of the various stages of mitosis with greater precision than has been reported previously. The early dissolution of the nuclear envelope has been found to be preceded by a marked undulation of this structure within the nuclear "hof." This undulation appears to be intimately related to the spindle-forming activity of the centriole at this time. Marked pericentriolar osmiophilia and extensive arrays of vesicles are also prominent at this stage, the former continuing into anaphase. Progression of the cell through prophase is accompanied by a disappearance of these vesicles. A complex that first makes its appearance in prophase but becomes most prominent in metaphase is a partially membrane-bounded cluster of dense osmiophilic bodies. These clusters which have a circumferential distribution in the mitotic cell are shown to be derived from multivesicular bodies and are acid phosphatase-positive. The precise selection of cells during the various stages of anaphase has made it possible to follow chronologically the morphological features of the initiation of nuclear membrane reformation. The nuclear membrane appears to be derived from polar aggregates of endoplasmic reticulum, and the process begins less than 2 minutes after the onset of karyokinesis. While formation of the nuclear envelope is initiated on the polar aspects of the chromatin mass, envelope elements appear on the equatorial aspect long before the polar elements fuse. Apparently interfering with this fusion are continuous spindle tubules which traverse the chromatin mass in striking density at characteristic points. Several cortical changes, also most pronounced in anaphase, have been described, as has the kinetochore which is seen to good advantage only in this stage. The Golgi complex has been found to disappear both morphologically and histochemically during mitosis and to reappear rapidly in telophase. Evidence is presented which implicates the continuous spindle tubules in certain phases of chromosome movement.
