The GPLA B and Ia (I region-associated) antigens are the products of genes found in the guinea pig major histocompatibility complex. Because of their importance in immune response phenomena, a structural study of these antigens was undertaken. [3H]leucine and [3H]fucose were internally incorporated into guinea pig lymph node cells. The GPLA B and Ia antigens were solubilized by the nonionic detergent Nonidet P- 40, purified by affinity chromatography using an adsorbent column of lentil lectin, isolated by immunoprecipitation, and examined by discontinuous polyacrylamide-sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. The GPLA antigens B.1, B.2, B.3, and B.4, were shown to be glycoproteins of mol wt 40,000 daltons and to be noncovalently associated with a 12,000 dalton protein. The molecules bearing B.2 and B.3 in a B.2/B.3 heterozygote are shown to be separable, suggesting the antigenic determinant is a primary gene product. In addition, a new GPLA determinant, S, which resembles the B antigen in that it is found on a molecule of approximately 40,000 daltons, was studied. In a B.2/B.3 S+ animal the molecule bearing antigen S was shown to be independent of those bearing B.2 and B.3, providing evidence that the genes determining B and S are at separate loci. The Ia-bearing molecules identified by anti-Ia.2,4 are glycoproteins of mol wt 58,000 daltons which are composed of two subunits of 33,000 and 25,000 daltons, respectively, linked by disulfide bonds. The Ia-bearing molecules are independent of GPLA-bearing molecules, indicating different loci determining these antigens. By all criteria, the guinea pig GPLA B antigens appear homologous to the murine H-2D and H-2K antigens, while the guinea pig Ia antigens appear homologous to the Ia antigens of the mouse.
