]. To confirm this, we performed microsatellite genotyping using a variety of short tandem repeat makers and analyzed allelotypes of 8 mucinous tumors (4 mucinous carcinomas, 3 atypical proliferative mucinous tumors and 1 mucinous cystadenoma) associated with a teratoma to determine whether they were clonally related. 7 of the 8 mucinous tumors showed complete or a high degree of homozygosity. Among the 6 pairs of tumors with teratoma tissue available for comparison, 5 of 6 showed a high or complete degree of allelotypes matching, which differed from the somatic allelotypes of the normal control tissue. A discrepancy was detected between carcinoma and teratoma in one pair at several loci, with different X-chromosome inactivation patterns revealed by the HUMARA clonality assay. We also investigated the allelotypes of 16 ovarian mucinous carcinomas without a teratoma in young patients (range 13–30) and in 6 older patients (range 40–67) using the same method. None of these tumors showed pure homozygosity. The number of homozygous loci in this cohort was significantly lower than that in the first. Our results suggest first, that most mucinous tumors associated with a teratoma are derived from the teratoma but occasionally they could be collision tumors and second that the majority of pure mucinous tumors in young women in whom a teratoma is not present are not derived from a teratoma.
