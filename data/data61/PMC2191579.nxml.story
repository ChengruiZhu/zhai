Using a series of phenotypic markers that include immunoglobulin (Ig)D, IgM, IgG, CD23, CD44, Bcl-2, CD38, CD10, CD77, and Ki67, human tonsillar B cells were separated into five fractions representing different stages of B cell differentiation that included sIgD+ (Bm1 and Bm2), germinal center (Bm3 and Bm4), and memory (Bm5) B cells. To establish whether the initiation of somatic mutation correlated with this phenotypic characterization, we performed polymerase chain reaction and subsequent sequence analysis of the Ig heavy chain variable region genes from each of the B cell subsets. We studied the genes from the smallest VH families (VH4, VH5, and VH6) in order to facilitate the mutational analysis. In agreement with previous reports, we found that the somatic mutation machinery is activated only after B cells reach the germinal center and become centroblasts (Bm3). Whereas 47 independently rearranged IgM transcripts from the Bm1 and Bm2 subsets were nearly germline encoded, 57 Bm3-, and Bm4-, and Bm5- derived IgM transcripts had accumulated an average of 5.7 point mutations within the VH gene segment. gamma transcripts corresponding to the same VH gene families were isolated from subsets Bm3, Bm4, and Bm5, and had accumulated an average of 9.5 somatic mutations. We conclude that the molecular events underlying the process of somatic mutation takes place during the transition from IgD+, CD23+ B cells (Bm2) to the IgD-, CD23-, germinal center centroblast (Bm3). Furthermore, the analysis of Ig variable region transcripts from the different subpopulations confirms that the pathway of B cell differentiation from virgin B cell throughout the germinal center up to the memory compartment can be traced with phenotypic markers. The availability of these subpopulations should permit the identification of the functional molecules relevant to each stage of B cell differentiation.
