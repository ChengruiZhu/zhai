Rabbits were immunized against the plasminogen activator released by SV4- virus-transformed hamster embryo cells. The resulting antiplasminogen activator immunoglobulin (APA-IgG) inhibited the enzymatic activity of the plasminogen activator produced by SV40- transformed hamster cells, and the plasmin-catalyzed release of these cells from the tissue culture dish. APA-IgG was not cytotoxic for these cells even in the presence of complement and did not inhibit their release of plasminogen activator. APA-IgG formed a single precipitin line in immunodiffusion plates using highly purified plasminogen activator as antigen. APA-IgG inhibited the plasminogen activator produced by newborn hamster lung cells and by an established diploid line (DON) of hamster lung cells, but did not inhibit plasminogen activators produced by normal or transformed hamster kidney cells or by cells of other species (mouse and human). We derive three major conclusions from these data: (a) There are several immunologically distinguishable forms (isozymes) of plasminogen activators in normal hamster tissues. (b) The plasminogen activators produced by normal hamster lung cells and by SV40 virus-transformed hamster embryo cells share antigenic determinants and are presumably the same isozyme. (c) The plasminogen activators produced by different hamster tumor cells do not share antigenic determinants and are presumably different isozymes.
