 The concentration of horseradish peroxidase in total particulate fractions from the kidney cortex did not change much during the first few hours after injection, as long as most of the injected protein was not yet cleared from the blood. It decreased at a rate of 6â€“8% per hr afterwards. The concentration of peroxidase in total particulate fractions increased in proportion to the load (dose) over a wide range, suggesting that a constant fraction of the protein was reabsorbed by micropinocytic vesicles into the tubule cells from the glomerular filtrate. The amount of peroxidase excreted in the urine also increased in proportion to the injected dose. The proportion of peroxidase taken up by the liver, however, decreased several times when the dose was increased. A marked decrease of protein uptake into the kidney cortex and an increase of urinary excretion were observed when rats received a second, equal dose of peroxidase 4 hr after the first injection, and the rate of clearance of peroxidase from the blood was decreased after the second injection. The liver, on the other hand, took up almost twice as much peroxidase after two injections as after one. The uptake of peroxidase by the kidney cortex increased with age. Cytochemical observations on the preferential absorption of peroxidase by certain cell types and segments of the renal tubules in relation to dose are reported.
