The spread of infectious diseases can be inhibited by both vaccines and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as hand-washing, respiratory etiquette, and social distancing. Theoretical models of disease spread have incorporated how individuals make decisions concerning these interventions in the face of disease risks and intervention costs. However, most previous models have considered these two interventions separately from one another. Here we combine decision-making processes for both interventions in a single model that simulates influenza spread through a network. Individuals choose interventions based on their past and present experiences with influenza, and the personal and social impacts of their choices. Our model indicates that, due to feedback loops between the interventions via their mutual impact on disease levels, efforts to reduce influenza spread by expanding NPI practice are almost completely mitigated by the resulting drop in vaccine coverage, whereas efforts to expand vaccine coverage are only weakly affected by the response of NPI practice. Furthermore, strategies such as making vaccines more available, stressing the harms of being infected, or stressing the social benefits of preventing infection through both interventions will prevent more disease than only expanding NPI practice through making hand sanitizers more widely available, for example.
