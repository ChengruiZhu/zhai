 by shRNA-mediated knockdown or the overexpression of GPC5 through scratch and transwell assays. The mean migration rates of cancer cells transfected with pRNAT-shRNA-GPC5-1 were reduced compared with the controls in A549 (P<0.001) and H3255 (P=0.001), while the migration rate of SPC-A1 with GPC5 overexpression was higher than that of the control (P=0.001). The downregulation of GPC5 impeded the transmigration of A549 and H3255 while the upregulation of GPC5 expression promoted the transmembrane invasion of SPC-A1. Furthermore, a panel of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded NSCLC tissues from 127 patients undergoing curative resection (stages I, II and III) between January, 2003 and December, 2008 were obtained in order to investigate the correlation between GPC5 expression and clinicopathological factors using immunohistochemical methods. The results demonstrated that high GPC5 expression levels in NSCLC were associated with respiratory symptoms in lung cancer diagnosis, poor differentiation, vascular invasion, regional lymph node metastasis and a higher TNM stage. Using the Kaplan-Meier method, NSCLC patients with high levels of GPC5 expression demonstrated a significantly shorter overall survival time compared with those with low GPC5 expression levels (median postsurgical survival time: 14.0 months vs. 59.0 months, P=0.001). GPC5 expression was also identified as an independent prognostic factor by Cox regression analysis [adjusted hazard ratio: 2.18; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.35â€“3.52; P=0.001]. This study suggested that increased levels of GPC5 expression are a poor prognostic marker for NSCLC.
