Big data is extremely large amount of data which is available in the radiology department. Big data is identified by four Vs – Volume, Velocity, Variety, and Veracity. By applying different algorithmic tools and converting raw data to transformed data in such large datasets, there is a possibility of understanding and using radiology data for gaining new knowledge and insights. Big data analytics consists of 6Cs – Connection, Cloud, Cyber, Content, Community, and Customization. The global technological prowess and per-capita capacity to save digital information has roughly doubled every 40 months since the 1980's. By using big data, the planning and implementation of radiological procedures in radiology departments can be given a great boost. Potential applications of big data in the future are scheduling of scans, creating patient-specific personalized scanning protocols, radiologist decision support, emergency reporting, virtual quality assurance for the radiologist, etc. Targeted use of big data applications can be done for images by supporting the analytic process. Screening software tools designed on big data can be used to highlight a region of interest, such as subtle changes in parenchymal density, solitary pulmonary nodule, or focal hepatic lesions, by plotting its multidimensional anatomy. Following this, we can run more complex applications such as three-dimensional multi planar reconstructions (MPR), volumetric rendering (VR), and curved planar reconstruction, which consume higher system resources on targeted data subsets rather than querying the complete cross-sectional imaging dataset. This pre-emptive selection of dataset can substantially reduce the system requirements such as system memory, server load and provide prompt results. However, a word of caution, “big data should not become “dump data” due to inadequate and poor analysis and non-structured improperly stored data. In the near future, big data can ring in the era of personalized and individualized healthcare.
