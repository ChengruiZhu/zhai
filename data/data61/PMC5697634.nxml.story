Delayed‐release dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is an oral therapy for relapsing multiple sclerosis with anti‐inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. This 2‐period crossover study was conducted to evaluate the potential for drug–drug interaction between DMF (240 mg twice daily) and a combined oral contraceptive (OC; norgestimate 250 μg, ethinyl estradiol 35 μg). Forty‐six healthy women were enrolled; 32 completed the study. After the lead‐in period (OC alone), 41 eligible participants were randomized 1:1 to sequence 1 (OC and DMF coadministration in period 1; OC alone in period 2) or sequence 2 (regimens reversed). Mean concentration profiles of plasma norelgestromin (primary metabolite of norgestimate) and ethinyl estradiol were superimposable following OC alone and OC coadministered with DMF, with 90% confidence intervals of geometric mean ratios for area under the plasma concentration–time curve over the dosing interval and peak plasma concentration contained within the 0.8–1.25 range. Low serum progesterone levels during combined treatment confirmed suppression of ovulation. The pharmacokinetics of DMF (measured via its primary active metabolite, monomethyl fumarate) were consistent with historical data when DMF was administered alone. No new safety concerns were identified. These results suggest that norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol–based OCs may be used with DMF without dose modification.
