The importance of miRNAs in the progression of prostate cancer (PCa) has further been supported by the finding that miRNAs have been identified as potential oncogenes or tumor suppressors in PCa. Indeed, in eukaryotes, miRNAs have been found to regulate and control gene expression by degrading mRNA at the post-transcriptional level. In this study, we investigated the expression of miR-34 family members, miR-34b and miR-34c, in different PCa cell lines, and discussed the molecular mechanism of miR-34b in the invasion and migration of PCa cells in vitro. The difference analyses of the transcriptome between the DU145 and PC3 cell lines demonstrated that both miR-34b and -34c target critical pathways that are involved in metabolism, such as proliferation, and migration, and invasion. The molecular expression of miR-34b/c were lower in PC3 cells. Moreover, over-expression of miR-34b/c in PC3 cells caused profound phenotypic changes, including decreased cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Moreover, the players that regulate expression levels of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), TGF-β receptor 1 (TGF-βR1), and p53 or phosphorylation levels of mothers against decapentaplegic 3 (SMAD3) in the TGF-β/Smad3 signaling pathway have yet to be elucidated, and will provide novel tools for diagnosis and treatment of metastatic PCa.
