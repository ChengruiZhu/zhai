The aim of this study was to investigate the abnormal expression of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-9 (ADAM9) in human resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissue, in order to evaluate the significance of ADAM9 expression in surgically resected NSCLC. Sixty-four cases of completely resected stage I NSCLC with mediastinal N2 lymph node dissection were immunohistochemically analyzed for ADAM9 protein expression. Survival, univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to assess the significance of ADAM9 expression and its correlation with other clinicopathological characteristics. ADAM9 was observed to be significantly more highly expressed in NSCLC tissue compared with normal control lung tissue (P=0.001). The 5-year survival rate for patients with NSCLC tissues highly expressing ADAM9 was significantly lower when compared with NSCLC tissues of patients exhibiting low expression of ADAM9 (56.9 vs. 88.9%, P= 0.012). Multivariate analysis identified that high expression of ADAM9 is an independent factor of shortened survival time in resected stage I NSCLC (HR, 3.385; 95% CI, 1.224â€“9.360; P=0.019). These results clearly demonstrate that ADAM9 is highly expressed in NSCLC and highly expressed ADAM9 correlates with shortened survival time, suggesting that ADAM9 is a novel biomarker for predicting prognosis in resected stage I NSCLC. ADAM9 may also become a useful predictive biomarker for the selection of adjuvant chemotherapy treatment of NSCLC.
