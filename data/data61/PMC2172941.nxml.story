During the systemic inflammatory response, circulating cytokines interact with the vascular endothelium, resulting in activation and nuclear accumulation of the nuclear transcription factor, nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB). In turn, NFκB transactivates relevant proinflammatory genes, resulting in an amplification of the inflammatory response. Because this scenario is potentially detrimental to the host, mechanisms exist to limit this amplification. Using an in vitro system that mimics the vascular–interstitial interface during inflammation (cell culture inserts), we provide evidence for the existence of a novel negative feedback mechanism on NFκB activity. We show that the interleukin 1β–induced accumulation of nuclear NFκB in human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers is dramatically reduced when polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) are allowed to migrate across these monolayers. This effect does not appear to be due to PMN-derived elastase or nitric oxide. Fixed PMN (adhere but do not migrate) did not affect nuclear NFκB. Furthermore, cross-linking of platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1), but not intercellular adhesion molecule-1, reduces human umbilical vein endothelial cell nuclear NFκB induced by interleukin 1β. Finally, interaction of PMN with PECAM-1–deficient endothelial cells does not reduce nuclear NFκB. These observations indicate that engagement of PECAM-1 by emigrating PMN is a pivotal event in this negative feedback on NFκB activity.
