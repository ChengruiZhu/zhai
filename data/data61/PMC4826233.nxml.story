Emerging evidence has linked aberrantly expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) with oncogenesis and malignant development in various human cancers. However, their specific roles and functions in gastric carcinoma (GC) remain largely undefined. In this study we identify and report a novel miRNA, miR-1225-5p, as tumor suppressor in GC development and progression. Microarray analysis revealed that there were fifty-six differentially expressed miRNAs (thirty-two upregulated and twenty-four downregulated) in GC tumor samples compared to their corresponding nontumorous tissues. Downregulation of miR-1225-5p was frequently detected in GC and strongly correlated with more aggressive phenotypes and poor prognosis. Functional assays demonstrated that ectopic overexpression of miR-1225-5p could inhibit cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion in vitro, as well as suppress tumor growth and metastasis in nude mice. Further integrative and functional studies suggested insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) as a downstream effector of miR-1225-5p which acted through β-catenin signaling pathway. These results demonstrate that miR-1225-5p serves to constrain GC growth and metastatic potential via inhibition of IRS1 and β-catenin signaling. Therefore, downregulation of miR-1225-5p is likely to be one of major molecular mechanisms accounting for the development and progression of GC.
