Since 2011, transcutaneous bone-anchored auditory implants have been an alternative to the classic percutaneous implant (Baha) for bilateral conductive/mixed hearing loss that cannot be corrected by surgery. Recently, a new transcutaneous device has been approved for clinical use. Its internal component is made of the classic titanium Baha fixture, coupled to a 27 mm diameter subcutaneous circular magnet. The external component includes a second circular magnet 29 mm in diameter and a digital sound processor. To date, there are no reports describing the results of the application of this device. The aim of the present study is to report on the anatomical and functional results of transcutaneous Baha implantation in three patients: two adults, one with syndromic aural atresia and one with bilateral conductive hearing loss due to bilateral tympanomastoidectomy, and an 8-year-old child with non-syndromic aural atresia. No major intraoperative or postoperative complications were observed. The three patients tolerated the external magnet, with no signs of skin irritation. Functional results were good: median unaided free-field PTA (0.5-3 kHz) was 50 dB HL (range = 41-66 dB HL); with the transcutaneous Baha median PTA (0.5-3 kHz) was 27 dB HL (range = 25-30 dB HL) and median gain was 25 dB HL (range = 11-39 dB HL). Preliminary results encourage use of the device as a valuable alternative to other implantable devices in these patients. To ensure the success of treatment, several precautions are suggested including gradually increasing use during the first post-operative months to favour skin adaptation to magnet pressure. In addition to skin reactions, in a paediatric age most concerns are related to the curvature of the skull, which may induce tenting of the skin over the internal magnet.
