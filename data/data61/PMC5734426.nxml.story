Restorative proctocolectomy (RPC) with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the standard surgical treatment for ulcerative colitis (UC). Emergency colectomies are performed for fulminant colitis (ie, toxic megacolon, profuse bleeding, perforation, or sepsis). The RPC and IPAA involve manipulation of the proximal ileum, which may influence the essential physiological function of gut-associated lymphoid tissues. Circulating plasma immunoglobulin G (p-IgG) deficiency is observed in patients with fulminant UC. In addition, increased levels have been reported in colonic tissues of active UC compared with quiescent disease. We aimed to examine levels of p-IgG for clinical evaluation following emergency colectomies in patients with fulminant UC compared with patients with quiescent disease having elective RPC operations. In total 45 patients received an ileoanal pouch (IAP) due to UC. In all, 27 patients were men and 18 were women. The mean age was 34 years (range: 18-55). Because of fulminant UC, 26 patients had emergency subtotal colectomies with terminal ileostomy (TI). During second operation, the rectum was excised, and an IAP with diverting loop ileostomy (DLI) was performed. Nineteen patients had elective operations and had colectomies performed in conjunction with the pouch operation. Mucosectomy was performed in all groups. As a last procedure, the DLI was closed. Blood samples for immunoglobulin G (IgG) analyses were collected from each patient before the colectomy, after the colectomy with TI (before construction of the pouch), during the period with pouches (prior to DLI closure), and at 1, 2, and 3 years and at mean 13.7 years (range: 10-20) after DLI closure. Immunoglobulin G was determined by immunonephelometric assay technique. The statistics were analyzed by analysis of variance and linear regression. Preoperatively, p-IgG was significantly lower in the patients who had emergency operations compared with the group that had elective operations, 9.9 ± 3.0 vs 11.5 ± 3.3 g/L (
