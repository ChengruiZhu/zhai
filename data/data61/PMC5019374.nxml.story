Tract-tracing depends on active axonal transport of tracers between nerve cells, indicating the anatomical connectivity between areas of the brain. Recent advances in tract-tracing technology have enabled reconstruction of the connectome or wiring diagram of mammalian cerebral cortex. Here, we propose a novel statistical model to account for the noise arising from automation of tract-tracing measurements and from injections of tracer into multiple cortical areas simultaneously. On this basis, we find that the strength of anatomical connectivity in the mouse brain varies over six orders of magnitude, with the weakest links between regions approximately representing a few axons. Including all weak links above the statistical noise thresholds, we find that the connection density of the mouse connectome (73%) is greater than previously reported. Many of the complex topological and spatial properties of the mouse brain network emerge on the basis of the strongest axonal projections, whereas the weakest links have a more random organization. We conclude that inter-areal connections mediated by a few axons can be rigorously distinguished from experimental sources of noise in contemporary tract tracing data. Such weak links could support integrated functions of the mouse brain network and/or could represent an element of randomness in its formation.
