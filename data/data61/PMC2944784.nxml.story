Cranial placodes, which produce sensory structures in the head, arise from a contiguous band of preplacodal ectoderm surrounding the anterior neural plate during gastrulation. Little is known about early regulation of preplacodal ectoderm, but modulation of signaling through Bone Morphogenetic Protein (Bmp) is clearly involved. Recent studies show that dorsally expressed Bmp-antagonists help establish preplacodal ectoderm, but it is not clear whether antagonists titrate Bmp to a discrete low level that actively induces preplacodal fate or, alternatively, whether Bmp must be fully blocked to permit preplacodal development. We show that in zebrafish preplacodal development occurs in distinct phases with differing Bmp requirements. Initially, Bmp is required before gastrulation to render all ventral ectoderm competent to form preplacodal tissue. We further show that four transcription factors, Foxi1, Gata3, Tfap2a, and Tfap2c, specifically mediate preplacodal competence. Once induced, these factors no longer require Bmp. Thereafter, Bmp must be fully blocked by dorsally expressed Bmp-antagonists to permit preplacodal development. In addition, dorsally expressed Fgf and/or Pdgf are also required, activating preplacodal development in competent cells abutting the neural plate. Thus, we have resolved the role of Bmp and traced the regulation of preplacodal development to pre-gastrula stage.
