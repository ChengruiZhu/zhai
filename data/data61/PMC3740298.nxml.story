The vaccinia-related kinases (VRKs) comprise a branch of the casein kinase family. VRK1, a ser/thr kinase with a nuclear localization, is the most well-studied paralog and has been described as a proproliferative protein. In lower eukaryotes, a loss of VRK1 activity is associated with severe mitotic and meiotic defects. Mice that are hypomorphic for VRK1 expression are infertile, and depletion of VRK1 in tissue culture cells can impair cell proliferation and alter several signaling pathways. VRK1 has been implicated as part of a ‘gene-expression signature' whose overexpression correlates with poor clinical outcome in breast cancer patients. We present here our investigation of the role of VRK1 in the growth of normal (MCF10) and malignant (MDA-MB-231) human mammary epithelial cells, and demonstrate that shRNA-mediated depletion of VRK1 slows their proliferation significantly. Conversely, stable overexpression of a FLAG-tagged VRK1 transgene imparts a survival advantage to highly malignant MDA-MB-231 cells under conditions of nutrient and growth factor deprivation. Moreover, in a murine orthotopic xenograft model of breast cancer, we demonstrate that tumors depleted of VRK1 show a 50% reduction in size from 4–13 weeks postengraftment. The incidence and burden of distal metastases in the lungs and brain was also significantly reduced in mice engrafted with VRK1-depleted cells. These studies demonstrate that VRK1 depletion or overexpression has an impact on the proliferation and survival of cell lines derived from normal or malignant mammary tissue, and moreover show that depletion of VRK1 in MDA-MB-231 cells reduces their oncogenic and metastatic properties
