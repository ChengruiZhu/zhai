) is considered a contraindication in the use of intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke. Little literature exists regarding tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) usage in thrombocytopenic patients, especially in older patients. Age and stroke severity are major prognostic indicators of the risk of hemorrhagic transformation. The Stroke Prognostication using Age and NIH Stroke Scale (SPAN) index estimates a patient’s risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and clinical response to thrombolysis by combining age in years with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores. If the total numeric sum is 100 or more, these individuals are considered SPAN-100-positive, while those with a sum less than 100 are considered SPAN-100-negative patients. SPAN-100-positive patients are found to have a greater risk of ICH and poorer long-term outcomes than SPAN-100-negative patients both with and without thrombolysis treatment. SPAN-100-positive patients are found to have a greater risk of ICH and poorer long-term outcomes than SPAN-100-negative patients both with and without thrombolysis treatment. Nonetheless, SPAN-100-positive patients treated with tPA have a reduced relative likelihood of severe disability or death than SPAN-100-positive patients not treated with tPA. We report a case of a SPAN-100-positive, 90-year-old community-dwelling patient who presented with an acute ischemic stroke, an NIHSS score of 14 with near complete left-sided plegia, and a platelet count of 85,000/mm
