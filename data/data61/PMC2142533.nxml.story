 1. The metabolism of chick embryo tissues has been followed by analysis of the culture media after various periods of incubation in roller bottles. 2. The initial rate of glucose utilization is increased by increasing glucose in the medium from 100 to 500 mg. per cent. Total glucose used can be increased in the same way or by daily addition of small amounts. Glucose is used in greatest amount when the medium containing 100 mg. per cent is replaced daily. 3. Although glucose consumption appears necessary for survival of cultures it may be used at a rate far in excess of that required for life and maximal growth. Complete blocking of mitosis by colchicine does not alter the rate of glucose utilization. 4. Proteolytic activity of the cultures is shown by an increase in the amino nitrogen of the peptone medium after incubation with tissue. 5. Utilization of nitrogen from an amino acid medium is shown by a decrease in the amino nitrogen of this medium. Cells obtaining their nitrogen from amino acids proliferate as rapidly as those grown in a medium identical except for the substitution of peptone, but the cell type is markedly different, in that embryo muscle forms cells resembling regenerating adult muscle. 6. Lactic acid was formed in both the presence and absence of glucose. Its formation increased with increased glucose utilization. There is some evidence that lactate may be utilized, and that it favors growth in the absence of glucose. 7. Added pyruvate was rapidly metabolized by the tissues. It, too, favors growth slightly in the absence of glucose.
