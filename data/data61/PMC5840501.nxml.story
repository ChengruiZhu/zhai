The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical significance of hsa-microRNA-124-3p (miR-124) in osteosarcoma (OS), and examine its role in cell growth and invasion. Using a microRNA chip array, the expression of miR-124 was detected in samples of surgically resected OS and matched against the levels of expression in tumor-adjacent normal tissues. The levels of miR-124 were upregulated in the OS cells through the transfection of miR-124 mimics. Cell proliferation and Transwell assays were performed to determine cell proliferation and invasion; Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blot and luciferase assays were then used to detect the expression of the target gene snail family zinc finger 2 (Snail2). The expression of miR-124 was significantly lower in the OS tissues, compared with that in the tumor-adjacent normal tissues; and the expression of miR-124 in the tumor tissues was significantly associated with tumor size. miR-124 directly repressed the expression of Snail2, and resulted in a significant inhibition of cell proliferation and invasion. In a mouse model, the overexpression of miR-124 significantly inhibited U2OS cell proliferation and invasion. Taken together, miR-124 was associated with the adverse clinical and pathological features observed in OS. It acted as a tumor suppressor to regulate the proliferation and invasion of OS cells by targeting Snail2, suggesting that miR-124 may be key in the progression of OS.
