Although several rare monogenic diseases are caused by defects in enzymes involved in sphingolipid biosynthesis and metabolism, little is known about the major variants that control the circulating levels of these important bioactive molecules. As well as being essential components of plasma membranes and endosomes, sphingolipids play critical roles in cell surface protection, protein and lipid transport and sorting, and cellular signalling cascades. Experimental evidence supports a role for sphingolipids in several common complex chronic metabolic, cardiovascular, or neurological disease processes. Therefore, sphingolipids represent novel and important intermediate phenotypes for genetic analysis, and discovering the genetic variants that influence their circulating concentrations is an important step towards understanding how the genetic control of sphingolipids might contribute to common human disease. We have identified 32 variants in 7 genes that have a strong effect on the circulating plasma levels of 33 distinct sphingolipids, and 43 matched metabolite ratios. In a series of 3 German MI studies, we see association with MI for variants in 3 of the genes tested. Further cardiovascular, metabolic, neurological, and psychiatric disease associations can be tested with the variants described here, which may identify additional disease risk and potentially useful therapeutic targets.
