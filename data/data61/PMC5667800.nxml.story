Bladder-sparing options are being developed for muscle-invasive bladder cancer in place of radical cystectomy, including the combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. We reasoned that improving the radiotherapy component of chemoradiation could improve the control of locally advanced disease. Previously, we showed that gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are potent enhancers of radiation therapy. We hypothesized that if AuNPs were to preferentially localize to bladder tumors, they may be used to enhance the radiation component of muscle-invasive bladder tumor therapy. Mice were treated with the carcinogen N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine (BBN) for 17, 20, and 22 weeks – long enough to induce muscle-invasive tumors. Mice were then anesthetized and injected intravenously with 1.9 nm AuNPs of which most were rapidly cleared from the blood and excreted after a 30–50 minute residence time in the bladder. We found AuNPs distributed throughout the bladder wall, but most of the AuNPs were associated with the stroma surrounding the tumor cells or extracellular keratin produced by the tumor cells. There were relatively few AuNPs in the tumor cells themselves. The AuNPs therefore localized to tumor-associated stroma and this tumor specificity might be useful for specific X-ray dose enhancement therapy of muscle-invasive bladder carcinomas.
