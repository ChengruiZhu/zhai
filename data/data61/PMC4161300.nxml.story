The evolution of reproductive barriers between species, like inviability and sterility in hybrids, continues to fascinate and puzzle evolutionary biologists. However, very few studies have successfully identified the genes responsible for these barriers, or when the underlying mutations appeared during species' evolutionary history of divergence. Differentiating whether specific isolation-causing mutations evolved early versus late in the divergence history of lineages can reveal important insights into the mechanisms of speciation—how new species are formed. Here we infer the evolutionary timing of these loci using data on the chromosomal location of genes that cause reduced hybrid pollen and seed fertility among three species in the wild tomato group, and information on their evolutionary relationships. With genetic crosses that combine these sterility loci from different lineages, we evaluate whether sterility effects are due to the same mutational change(s)—earlier in the history of evolutionary divergence among these species—or to independent mutational changes—later in their evolutionary divergence. We show that most sterility loci separating species are unique to a single species pair, and most isolation-causing mutations arose on recent evolutionary branches. Our data are consistent with mathematical models that predict that these loci should ‘snowball’ between species as they diverge.
