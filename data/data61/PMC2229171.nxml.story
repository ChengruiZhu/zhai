Phagocytes generate large amounts of metabolic acid during activation. Therefore, the presence of a conductive pathway capable of H+ extrusion has been suggested (Henderson, L. M., J. B. Chappell, and O. T. G. Jones. 1987. Biochemical Journal. 246:325-329). In this report, electrophysiological and fluorimetric methods were used to probe the existence of a H+ conductance in murine peritoneal macrophages. In suspended cells, recovery of the cytosolic pH (pHi) from an acid-load in Na+ and HCO3(-)-free medium was detectable in depolarizing but not in hyperpolarizing media. The rate of alkalinization was potentiated by the rheogenic ionophore valinomycin. These findings are consistent with the existence of a conductive H+ (equivalent) pathway. This notion was confirmed by patch-clamping and fluorescence ratio measurements of single adherent cells. When voltage was clamped in the whole-cell configuration, depolarizing pulses induced a sizable outward current which was accompanied by cytosolic alkalinization. Several lines of evidence indicate that H+ (equivalents) carry this current: (a) the conductance was unaffected by substitution of the major ionic constituents of the intra-and/or extracellular media, (b) the reversal potential of the tail currents approached the H+ equilibrium potential; and (c) the voltage-induced currents and pHi changes were both Zn2+ sensitive and had similar time course and potential dependence. The peak whole-cell current displayed marked outward rectification and was exquisitely H+ selective. At constant voltage, the H+ permeability was increased by lowering pHi but was inhibited by extracellular acidification. Together with the voltage dependence of the conductance, these features ensure that H+ extrusion can occur during activation, while potentially deleterious acid uptake is precluded. The properties of the conductance appear ideally suited for pHi regulation during phagocyte activation, because these cells undergo a sustained depolarization and an incipient acidification when stimulated. Comparison of the magnitude of the current with the amount of metabolic acid generated during macrophage activation indicates that the conductance is sufficiently large to contribute to the H+ extrusion required for maintenance of pHi.
