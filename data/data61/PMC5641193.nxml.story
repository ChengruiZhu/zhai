Previous studies have evaluated the effects of metformin use on survival outcomes in endometrial cancer, but their results are inconsistent. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide a quantitative assessment of the drug's effects based on available evidence. We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify relevant studies that evaluated the association between metformin use on survival outcomes in endometrial cancer. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate the association of metformin use with overall survival and with progression-free survival using a fixed-effects model. A total of nine studies involving 2,016 patients with endometrial cancer were identified. In a meta-analysis of eight studies involving 1,594 individuals, metformin use was associated with significant improvements in overall survival (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.64). Metformin users similarly showed improved progression-free survival in a meta-analysis of two studies involving 632 individuals (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.87). In conclusion, endometrial cancer patients who use metformin show improved overall survival and progression-free survival. Further studies are required to confirm the full potential effects of metformin use on survival outcomes in endometrial cancer.
