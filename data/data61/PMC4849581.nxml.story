The contribution of epistasis, or non-additive effects of risk alleles at different loci, to complex traits is much debated among human geneticists. In this study we use modeling and simulation to identify when evolutionary forces should drive epistasis to become a major part of the explanation for such traits. We simulate populations evolving in the presence of “phenotypic noise”, i.e. intrinsic and environmental variability in the relationship between genotype and phenotype, and focus specifically on traits that are substantially deleterious (e.g. fitness loss of at least 10%) and moderately common (population frequency between 0.1 and 10%). These criteria describe much “common”, heritable human disease, and knowing the expected contribution of epistasis to such diseases could greatly assist efforts to use genome-wide genetic associations to identify their mechanistic underpinnings. Here we show that, provided that appropriate levels and kinds of phenotypic noise are present during evolution, genetic contributions to disease traits can be expected to be strongly and synergistically epistatic, particularly among the most severely affected individuals in a population. By identifying scenarios most likely to select for synergistic epistasis, this study may help biologists identify when the extra effort is merited to search for combinatorial genetic interactions in human disease.
