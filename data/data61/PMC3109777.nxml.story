The aim was to evaluate the patients with chronic kidney disease stage 5 (CKD 5) and their prospective renal transplant donors with regard to their renal replacement choices, and to assess the medical and non-medical factors that affect living-related renal donor selection. Over 24 months, consecutive patients with CKD 5 and their relatives were interviewed at presentation. Reasons for the choice of modality were analyzed; the prospective recipients and their donors were again interviewed separately and the medical and nonmedical factors that affected the donor selection were determined. A total of 1257 patients were enrolled. Conservative therapy, maintenance dialysis, and renal transplantation were chosen by 513 (40.8%), 320 (25.5%), and 424 (33.7%) patients, respectively. Only socioeconomic status affected the modality chosen. The age, gender, and donor availability did not emerge as significant factors. Patients or donors were likely to withdraw from transplant evaluation due to the absence of a voluntary donor, presence of a male donor, coercion not to donate, and the absence of reimbursement. The commonest cause of rejection of a donor was blood group incompatibility (45.8%), followed by diabetes mellitus (DM) or risk of DM (24%), renal disease (5.9%), hypertension (5.5%), and persistent cross-match positivity (5.1%). To improve donation rates, the donorâ€™s spouse should be involved in the early stages of donor evaluation, financial support for the recipient has to be improved, and the apprehensions about complications of nephrectomy among the donors need to be alleyed. Male donors are at increased risk of leaving the program in the evaluation phase.
