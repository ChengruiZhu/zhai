The specificity of the FAT1 recognition in colon cancer was confirmed by pre-adsorbing mAb198.3, adsorption dramatically abolished the antibody reactivity on colon cancer, thus confirming the binding specificity. The DLS size distribution profile of the AuCOOH, AuCOOH(Cy5)_ mAb198.3, AuCOOH(Cy5)_isotype has showed that the modified gold nanoparticles are well dispersed in water, PBS buffer and cell culture medium with 10 % FBS. By TEM measurement, the size of Au nanoparticles with spherical morphology is about 10–20 nm. AuCOOH_198.3 NPs were stable in an acidic environment, as well as in PBS buffer, cell culture media and media with 10 % serum. MTT results revealed that Au nanoparticles have well biocompatibility. TEM results indicated that conjugation of mAb198.3 on Au nanoparticles can be an effective delivery vehicle for negatively charged gold nanoparticles and increased its intracellular transport. It was also demonstrated by confocal microscopy that AuCOOH(Cy5)_mAb198.3 could attach to the cell membrane in very short time, then gradually delivered into cells. After 4 h incubation, almost all AuCOOH(Cy5)_mAb198.3 have been uptaken into or surrounding the cytoplasm and nucleus. In vivo results showed that only about 20 % of AuCOOH accumulated in tumor site due to EPR effect, while nearly 90 % of AuCOOH_mAb198.3 was found in tumor, providing sufficient evidence for receptor-specific targeting by mAb198.3.
