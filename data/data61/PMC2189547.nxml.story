The Staphylococcus aureus exotoxin toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST- 1) is a potent activator of T cells and monocytes. We have recently demonstrated that TSST-1 is a superantigen that binds monomorphic determinants on MHC class II molecules. In the present study, we have examined the effect of TSST-1 on the activation and differentiation of high density human tonsillar B cells. TSST-1 bound to tonsilar B cells with high affinity and saturation kinetics. This binding was effectively inhibited by a combination of anti-HLA-DR and anti-HLA-DQ mAbs. Treatment of purified B cells with TSST-1 failed to induce B cell proliferation or Ig production. However, in the presence of irradiated T cells, TSST-1 induced resting B cells to proliferate and differentiate into Ig secretory cells. TSST-1 mimicked nominal antigen in that its induction of B cell responses was strictly dependent on physical contact between T and B cells, and was profoundly inhibited by anti-MHC class II mAbs, anti-CD3 mAbs, and, to a lesser extent, by anti- CD18 mAbs. However, unlike nominal antigen, TSST-1-mediated T/B cell interactions were MHC unrestricted. These results suggest that TSST-1 induces T cell-dependent B cell proliferation and differentiation by virtue of its ability to mediate MHC-unrestricted cognate T/B cell interaction via the TCR/CD3 complex and MHC class II antigens.
