Pterygium is a fibrovascular growth of the bulbar conjunctiva that crosses the limbus and extends over the peripheral cornea, in some cases resulting in significant visual morbidity. When treatment is indicated, surgery is necessary, and several management options exist. These include excision, conjunctival autografting, and the use of adjuvant therapies. This paper reviews the incidence and prevalence of pterygia and also describes the various techniques currently used to treat this condition. These management options are compared to the use of dry amniotic membrane grafting (AMG), specifically with regard to recurrence rates, time to recurrence, safety and tolerability, as well as patient factors including cosmesis and quality of life. AMG has been used in the treatment of ocular surface disease due to a variety of benefits, including its anti-inflammatory properties, as well as its ability to promote epithelial growth and suppress transforming growth factor-Î² signaling and fibroblast proliferation. However, rates of recurrence for AMG following pterygium excision still surpass other commonly used techniques, including conjunctival and limbal autografting. Nevertheless, there are circumstances in which AMG may be most beneficial to the patient, such as when preexisting conjunctival scarring is present, when the conjunctiva must be spared for future glaucoma filtering surgery, or in cases of large or double-headed pterygia. Therefore, surgeons should be prepared to offer this procedure as an option to their patients for the treatment of pterygia.
