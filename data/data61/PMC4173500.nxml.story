Epilepsy is one of the most common encountered neurological disorders. Surgical procedures in epileptic patient throw numerous challenges to the attending anesthesiologist during the perioperative period. Various anesthetic drug interactions with antiepileptics, intraoperative and postoperative seizures management and management of status epilepticus are few considerations which an anesthesiologist can confront both during emergency or elective surgery. The role of anesthesiologist acquires significant dimensions in management of epilepsy ranging from operative procedure, status epilepticus to the intensive care management of such patients. It requires a skilful and clinically precise handling of such patients during pre-op, peri-op and post-op period. Majority of times these patients present with co-morbidities which makes the prophylactic management of epilepsy extremely difficult during surgical procedures. The responsibilities of anesthesiologist involve management of epileptic patients not only during epilepsy and nonepilepsy surgery but for other diagnostic and therapeutic procedures as well where sedation or anesthesia services are required. Postoperative management of such patients include careful observation for any seizures and/or pseudo-seizures so as to manage appropriately. The knowledge regarding various antiepileptic agents and their potential side effects and interactions with anesthetic agents are of prime concern during surgical procedures for epilepsy and nonepileptic surgeries. The present article discusses the various anesthetic implications and considerations during management of such patients for epilepsy and nonepilepsy surgery.
