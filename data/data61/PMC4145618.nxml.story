 VLK-1 in submerged fermentation using wheat bran, a cheap and abundantly available agro-residue, through process optimization and to monitor the effect of temperature shift operation on it. The potential of xylanase in saccharification of wheat straw was also investigated. The results showed that optimization of the fermentation process by one variable approach increased the enzyme yield from 402 to 4,986 IU/ml. Subsequently, optimization of nitrogen and carbon sources through response surface methodology led to high level xylanase production (7,295 IU/ml) which was 1.46-fold greater than one variable approach after 56 h of cultivation at 30 °C. Temperature shift operation during fermentation resulted in maximum xylanase production in lesser duration (48 h instead of 56 h). Enzymatic hydrolysis of the alkali pre-treated wheat straw with 500 IU xylanase alone released 173 ± 8 mg sugars/g whereas in combination with cellulase and β-glucosidase released 553 ± 12 mg sugars/g dry substrate in 6 h, indicating its potential in saccharification of the lignocellulosic substrate. Temperature shift operation is likely to be attractive for large scale industrial fermentation due to significant reduction in the operating cost. To our knowledge, this is the first report which showed the effect of temperature shift operation on xylanase production from bacteria. The xylanase production from
