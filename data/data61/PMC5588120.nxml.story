We studied the clinical effects of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFCA) combined with trans-catheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in the treatment of breast cancer with liver metastasis. Eighty-eight patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer with liver metastasis for the first time and patients with liver metastasis after radical mastectomy were consecutively selected. The subjects were divided according to the different treatment methods. They were divided either into the control group of 50 cases or the observation group of 38 cases. Breast cancer patients underwent radical mastectomy with conventional systemic venous chemotherapy. The liver metastasis control group used TACE, while the observation group combined RFCA with TACE. The two groups were followed up for a median time of 20 months, and the clinical effects were compared. The effective rate of the observation group was higher than that of the control group; differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). There was no differences in the incidence of complications between the two groups (P>0.05). The progression free survival, median survival time and survival rate of the observation group were increased; differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). Therefore, RFCA combined with TACE in the treatment of breast cancer with liver metastasis is safe and effective.
