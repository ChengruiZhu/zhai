The purpose of this study was to assess the reproducibility (test-retest reliability and agreement) and concurrent validity of the Myotest for measuring step frequency (SF) and ground contact time (GCT) in recreational runners. Based on a within-subjects design (test and retest), SF and GCT of 14 participants (11 males, 3 females) were measured at three different running speeds with the Myotest during two test sessions. SF and GCT were also assessed with a foot-mounted accelerometer (Gold Standard, previously validated by comparing to force plate data) during the first test session. Levels of test-retest reliability and concurrent validity were expressed with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), agreement with standard errors of measurement (SEM). For SF, test-retest reliability (ICC’s > 0.75) and agreement of the Myotest were considered as good at all running speeds. For GCT, test-retest reliability was found to be moderate at a running speed of 14 km/h and poor at speeds of 10 and 12 km/h (ICC < 0.50). Agreement of the Myotest for GCT at all three running speeds was considered not acceptable given the SEM’s calculated. Concurrent validity of the Myotest with the foot-mounted accelerometer (Gold Standard) at all three running speeds was found to be good for SF (ICC’s > 0.75) and moderate for GCT (0.50 < ICC’s < 0.75). The conclusion of our study is that estimates obtained with the Myotest are reproducible and valid for SF but not for GCT.
