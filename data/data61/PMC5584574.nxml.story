 L. has been reported to exert anticancer effects. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether and how cancer cells exert protective responses against ESI treatment. Confocal fluorescence microscopy showed that ESI significantly induced autophagy flux in the lung cancer cells expressing mCherry-EGFP-LC3 reporter. Treatment of the cells with ESI increased the expression levels of the autophagy markers including LC3-II, ATG3 and Beclin1 in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreatment with autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) not only attenuated the effects of ESI on autophagy, but also enhanced the effects of ESI on cell viability and apoptosis. Mechanistically, the SILAC quantitative proteomics coupled with bioinformatics analysis revealed that the ESI-regulated proteins were mainly involved in Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response. We found that ESI induced the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 for activating the downstream target genes including HO-1 and p62 (SQSTM1). More importantly, ESI-induced p62 could competitively bind with Keap1, and releases Nrf2 to activate downstream target gene p62 as a positive feedback loop, therefore promoting autophagy. Furthermore, knockdown of Nrf2 or p62 could abrogate the ESI-induced autophagy and significantly enhanced the anticancer effect of ESI. Taken together, we demonstrated that ESI can sustain cell survival by activating protective autophagy through Nrf2-p62-keap1 feedback loop, whereas targeting this regulatory axis combined with ESI treatment may be a promising strategy for anticancer therapy.
