The gold standard for breast biopsy procedures is currently an open excision of the suspected lesion. However, an excisional biopsy inevitably makes a scar. The cost and morbidity associated with this procedure has prompted many physicians to evaluate less invasive, alternative procedures. More recently, image-guided percutaneous core-needle biopsy has become a frequently used method for diagnosing palpable and non-palpable breast lesions. Although sensitivity rates for core-needle biopsy are high, it has the disadvantage of histological underestimation, which renders the management of atypical ductal hyperplasia, papillary lesions, and fibroepithelial lesions somewhat difficult. Vacuum assisted breast biopsy (VABB) was developed to overcome some of these negative aspects of core-needle biopsy. VABB allows for a sufficient specimen to be obtained with a single insertion and can provide a more accurate diagnosis and completely remove the lesion under real-time ultrasonic guidance. The advantage of complete lesion removal with VABB is to reduce or eliminate sampling error, to decrease the likelihood of a histological underestimation, to decrease imaging-histological discordance, to decrease the re-biopsy rate, and to diminish the likelihood of subsequent growth on follow-up. In recent years, with the advancement of VABB instruments and techniques, many outcome studies have reported on the use of VABB for resecting benign breast lesions with a curative intent. VABB is highly accurate for diagnosing suspicious breast lesions and is highly successful at treating presumed benign breast lesions. Thus, in the near future, VABB will be routinely offered to all appropriately selected patients.
