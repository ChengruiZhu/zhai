Cationized human IgG can bind to the rat glomerular basement membrane (GBM), act as planted antigen, and induce in situ immune complex formation accompanied by severe glomerulonephritis. Perfusion of highly cationized human IgG (isoelectric point {more than} 9.5) via the left renal artery resulted in preferential localization within the perfused kidney (up to 56 percent of dose injected); after intravenous administration, only 4 percent was bound to the kidneys. The planted antigen was localized along the glomerular capillary walls and was accessible for antibody administered intravenously 1 h after perfusion, when virtually no antigen remained in the circulation. Persistence of cationized human IgG in the perfused kidney was markedly prolonged when complexed with antibody; one-half the cationized human IgG was still present after 12 d. There was a difference in the disappearance rates of antigen and antibody, as cationized human IgG was removed faster from the kidney than the antibody, the binding of which remained almost unchanged during the first week. Renal perfusion of a minimum of 20 μg of cationized human IgG, followed by intravenous injection of antibody, regularly induced severe glomerulonephritis with a proteinuria of at least 100 mg/24 h. The degree and the persistence of proteinuria induced depended on the dose of cationized human IgG perfused. Experiments using radiolabeled antigen and antibody showed that after renal perfusion of 20 μg cationized human IgG, 11.1 μg was kidney bound at the time of antibody injection. At the onset of proteinuria, 4.0 μg of antigen and 31.9 μg of anti-human IgG antibody were present in the perfused kidney. Immunofluorescence revealed immune deposits consisting of cationized human IgG and rabbit IgG (anti-human IgG) along the GBM. The staining pattern was linear (confluent) during the first 2 d and became granular during the course of the disease. Electronmicroscopically, a prominent finding was the accumulation of dense deposits, mainly in the subepithelial space and beneath the slit pores.
