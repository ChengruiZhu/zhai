Solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs) of the liver are rarely described; only 38 cases have been reported in literature, most of which have shown benign clinical characteristics, and only 3 of these cases exhibited malignant variants. In this study, we present a 24-year-old woman with a 1-month history of a rapidly enlarging abdominal mass and a CT showing an exophytic heterogeneous liver mass with a firm parietal bone mass. The patient underwent a transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) before operation, and an extended right hepatectomy and craniectomy with a negative margin was performed under general anesthesia. The masses showed histological features of oval spindle cells haphazardly arranged in the classic short-storiform or so-called patternless pattern of solitary fibrous tumors. The tumor cells showed positive immunohistochemical reactions to CD34 and bcl-2. The tumor recurred in the residual liver 2 months after operation, metastatic osteoblastic lesions in the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae were identified 3 months after the operation, and lumbar vertebrae metastasis 7 months after operation paralyzed the patient. The patient underwent percutaneous ethanol injection therapy (PEI) and chemotherapy, but the patient died because of the uncontrolled tumor 16 months after the initial operation. To our knowledge, this is the first case of malignant solitary fibrous liver tumors with skeletal metastasis.
