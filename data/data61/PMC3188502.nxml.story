Since Jacob and Monod stressed the importance of gene regulation in evolution, our understanding of the mechanisms of regulation has substantially advanced. In higher eukaryotes, genes often have complex regulatory input, which is encoded in cis-regulatory sequence with multiple transcription factor binding sites. However, the modes of genome evolution generating regulatory complexity are much less understood. This study reports a surprising finding: in fly regulatory modules, the majority of transcription factor binding sites show evidence of a local sequence duplication in their evolutionary history, which relates their sequence information to that of neighboring binding sites. Our analysis suggests that local sequence duplications are a pervasive production mode of regulatory information. This mode appears to be specific to higher eukaryotes; we have not found evidence of frequent local duplications in the yeast genome. Our results affect genomic sequence analysis, in particular, computational identification of cis-regulatory elements and alignment of regulatory DNA. At the same time, they address fundamental questions on the evolution of regulation: How much of the regulatory “grammar” observed in higher eukaryotes is due to optimization of function, and how much reflects the underlying sequence evolution modes? What is the result and what is the substrate of natural selection?
