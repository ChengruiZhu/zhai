Previously we demonstrated that Kr√ºppel-like factor 8 (KLF8) participates in oncogenic transformation of mouse fibroblasts and is highly overexpressed in human ovarian cancer. In this work, we first correlated KLF8 overexpression with the aggressiveness of ovarian patient tumors and then tested if KLF8 could transform human ovarian epithelial cells. Using the immortalized non-tumorigenic human ovarian surface epithelial cell line T80 and retroviral infection, we generated cell lines that constitutively overexpress KLF8 alone or its combination with the known ovarian oncogenes c-Myc, Stat3c and/or Akt and examined the cell lines for anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenesis. The soft agar clonogenic assay showed that T80/KLF8 cells formed significantly more colonies than the mock cells. Interestingly, the cells expressing both KLF8 and c-Myc formed the largest amounts of colonies greater than the sum of colonies formed by the cells expressing KLF8 and c-Myc alone. These results suggested that KLF8 might be a weak oncogene that works cooperatively with c-Myc to transform ovarian cells. Surprisingly, overexpression of KLF8 alone was sufficient to induce tumorigenesis in nude mice resulting in short life span whether the T80/KLF8 cells were injected subcutaneously, intraperitoneally or orthotopically into the ovarian bursa. Histopathological studies confirmed that the T80/KLF8 tumors were characteristic of human serous ovarian carcinomas. Comparative expression profiling and functional studies identified the cell cycle regulators cyclin D1 and USP44 as primary KLF8 targets and effectors for the T80 transformation. Overall, we identified KLF8 overexpression as an important factor in human ovarian carcinoma pathogenesis.
