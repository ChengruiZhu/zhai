Nitrogen is a major limiting factor for crop productivity. The relationship between photosynthesis and nitrogen nutrition has been widely studied. However, the molecular response of leaf photosynthesis to low nitrogen supply in crops is less clear. In this study, RNA sequencing technology (RNA-Seq) was used to investigate the gene expressions related to photosynthesis in maize in response to low nitrogen supply. It was found that low nitrogen supply down-regulated the expression of genes involved in photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII). Thus, low nitrogen supply down-regulated the expression of genes related to the antenna system, reduced light absorption, light transport, and electron transport. Correspondingly, the parameters related to chlorophyll fluorescence were very sensitive to nitrogen deficiency. Under low nitrogen supply, leaf chlorophyll content, actual quantum yield of PSII photochemistry, photochemical quenching, and electron transport rate, were reduced. However, the thermal diffusion and chlorophyll fluorescence were increased. RNA-Seq was used to analyze the genes involved in the response of leaf photosynthesis to low nitrogen supply in maize. These results highlight the possibility of utilizing chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, and the related genes, as indicators for plant nitrogen nutrition. This could lead to the development of new tools to make precise nitrogen fertilizer recommendations and select nitrogen-efficient genotypes.
