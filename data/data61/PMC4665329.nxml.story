Gastric cancer is the fourth most frequent cancer and the second cause of cancer-related mortalities worldwide. Platelets play an important and multifaceted role in cancer progression. Elevated mean platelet volume (MPV) detected in peripheral blood has been identified in various types of cancer. In the present study, we investigated the application value of MPV in the prediction of chemotherapy response and prognosis in patients with unresectable gastric cancer. A total of 128 patients with unresectable gastric cancer were included and divided according to the median values of baseline MPV (low MPV: <11.65 or high MPV: â‰¥11.65). A low baseline MPV level was correlated with reduced metastasis. The results showed that patients with a low baseline level of MPV improved response to chemotherapy. Changes in MPV were associated with therapeutic efficacy. Patients who remained in or were transferred into the low MPV level subgroup following first-line chemotherapy had improved response, compared to those remaining in or being transferred into the high MPV level group. The patients with a higher baseline MPV had decreased progression-free and overall survival ratios. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that baseline MPV was a prognostic factor affecting progression-free survival. In conclusion, the results showed that MPV measurements can provide important prognostic information for gastric cancer patients.
