This study was aimed at evaluation of changes in activities of selected antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase) and contents of key nonenzymatic antioxidants (glutathione, protein thiol groups, and α- and γ-tocopherols) in the left heart ventricle of young male Wistar rats subjected to endurance training (treadmill running, 1 h daily, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks) or/and testosterone propionate treatment (8 or 80 mg/kg body weight, intramuscularly, once a week, for 6 weeks) during adolescence. The training alone increased the activities of key antioxidant enzymes, but lowered the pool of nonenzymatic antioxidants and enhanced myocardial oxidative stress as evidenced by elevation of the lipid peroxidation biomarker malondialdehyde. The lower-dose testosterone treatment showed mixed effects on the individual components of the antioxidant defense system, but markedly enhanced lipid peroxidation. The higher-dose testosterone treatment decreased the activities of the antioxidant enzymes, lowered the contents of the nonenzymatic antioxidants, except for that of γ-tocopherol, reversed the effect of endurance training on the antioxidant enzymes activities, and enhanced lipid peroxidation more than the lower-dose treatment. These data demonstrate the potential risk to cardiac health from exogenous androgen use, either alone or in combination with endurance training, in adolescents.
