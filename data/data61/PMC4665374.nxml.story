The present study aimed to investigate the inhibitory ability of β-hydroxyisovaleryl-shikonin (β-HIVS) on the proliferation of human cervical cancer HeLa cells and to identify the mechanism of this effect. The HeLa cells were treated with β-HIVS and the inhibition of cell growth was detected by an MTT assay. Flow cytometry was performed to analyze the apoptosis rate and cell cycle distribution of HeLa cells. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were used to examine the expression of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway proteins. The results revealed that β-HIVS inhibited HeLa cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. With the administration of increasing concentrations of β-HIVS, the apoptotic rate of HeLa cells was also increased. The cell cycle was slightly arrested at the S phase, with ~6% of cells in this phase, subsequent to treatment with 10 µM β-HIVS. In addition, β-HIVS markedly reduced the expression levels of PI3K, AKT, mTOR and 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase in HeLa cells. β-HIVS promoted cervical cancer cell apoptosis by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and suppressing downstream gene expression. The present study is expected to lead to the development of molecular targeted therapy for this signaling pathway as a novel method of cervical cancer treatment.
