89% of vaccine recipients experienced a mild to moderate solicited injection site reaction vs. 47% of placebo recipients (P = 0.006, 95% CI 0.129, 0.676) that did not preclude additional doses. 64% of vaccine recipients experienced solicited systemic reactions vs. 53% of placebo recipients (P = 0.44, 95% CI -0.179, 0.402). Two serious adverse events occurred in 2 participants and were assessed as unrelated to HSV529 administration. Serum neutralizing antibody titers significantly increased from baseline after 3 doses of HSV529 compared with placebo in group 3 only (P < 0.001). This increase persisted up to 6 months after the third dose of vaccine (P < 0.001). Serum and vaginal antibodies to HSV2 glycoprotein D (gD) also significantly increased after 3 doses of vaccine in group 3 subjects (P < 0.001 and P = 0.012, respectively). The mean vaginal gD titer after 3 doses was about one-third of the mean serum gD titer. In addition, the vaccine induced significant levels of HSV2-specific antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) after 3 doses in group 3 subjects compared with placebo (P < 0.001). Vaccine-induced CD4 T-cell responses were detected in 46%, 27%, and 36% of subjects in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively, one month after the third dose of vaccine. CD8 T-cell responses were detected in 8%, 18%, and 14% of subjects in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively, at the same time point.
