The propensity for cancer to arise and progress is influenced not only by gene mutations (genetic abnormalities), but also by defects in gene expression programs that are inherited from one dividing cell to another. This change in the inheritance of gene expression patterns not associated with changes in the primary DNA sequence is referred to as an epigenetic abnormality. In virtually every form of cancer, tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) and candidate TSGs are epigenetically altered such that the ability of these genes to become activated and lead to production of the corresponding proteins is lost. This so-called gene “silencing” is often linked with abnormal accumulation of methyl groups to DNA (DNA methylation) in a region of the gene that controls its expression. The SIRT1 protein is an enzyme that can remove acetyl groups attached to specific amino acids in a number of different protein targets and thereby regulate gene silencing in yeast. However, in mammalian cells this has not been demonstrated. Here, the authors show SIRT1 is involved in epigenetic silencing of DNA-hypermethylated TSGs in cancer cells. Inhibition of SIRT1 by multiple approaches leads to TSG re-expression and a block in tumor-causing networks of cell signaling that are activated by loss of the TSGs in a wide range of cancers. This finding has important ramifications for the biology of cancer in terms of what maintains abnormal gene silencing. Furthermore, the authors propose that their observations may have potential clinical relevance in suggesting new means for restoring expression of abnormally silenced genes in cancer.
