The zinc finger-containing transcription factors Egr1 (Krox24) and Egr2 (Krox20) have been implicated in the proliferation and differentiation of many cell types. Egr2 has previously been shown to play a positive role in adipocyte differentiation but the function of Egr1 in this context is unknown. We compared the roles of Egr1 and Egr2 in the differentiation of murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Egr1 protein was rapidly induced after addition of differentiation cocktail while Egr2 protein initially remained low before increasing on days 1 and 2, concomitant with the disappearance of Egr1. In marked contrast to the effects of Egr2, differentiation was inhibited by ectopic expression of Egr1 and potentiated by knockdown of Egr1. The pro-adipogenic effects of Egr1 knockdown were particularly notable when IBMX was omitted from the differentiation medium. However, knockdown of Egr1 did not affect C/EBPβ protein expression or phosphorylation of CREB Ser133. Further, Egr1 did not directly affect the activity of promoters for the master adipogenic transcription factors, C/EBPα or PPARγ2, as assessed in luciferase reporter assays. These data indicate that Egr1 and Egr2 exert opposing influences on adipocyte differentiation and that the careful regulation of both is required for maintaining appropriate levels of adipogenesis. Further, the pro-differentiation effects of IBMX involve suppression of the inhibitory influence of Egr1.
