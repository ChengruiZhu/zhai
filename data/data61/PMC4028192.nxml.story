At the first retinal synapse, specific cells—horizontal cells (HCs)—inhibit photoreceptors and help to organize the receptive fields of another retinal cell type, bipolar cells. This synaptic interaction is crucial for visual contrast enhancement. Here we show that horizontal cells feed back to photoreceptors via a very fast ephaptic mechanism and a relatively slow mechanism. The slow mechanism requires ATP release via Pannexin 1 (Panx1) channels that are located on HC dendrites near the site where photoreceptors release the neurotransmitter glutamate to HCs and bipolar cells. The released ATP is hydrolyzed to produce AMP, phosphate groups, and protons; these phosphates and protons form a pH buffer, which acidifies the synaptic cleft. This slow acidification inhibits presynaptic calcium channels and consequently reduces the neurotransmitter release of photoreceptors. This demonstrates a new way in which ATP release can be involved in synaptic modulation. Surprisingly, the action of ATP is not purinergic but is mediated via changes in the pH buffer capacity in the synaptic cleft. Given the broad expression of Panx1 channels in the nervous system and the suggestion that Panx1 function underlies stabilization of synaptic plasticity and is needed for learning, we anticipate that this mechanism will be more widespread than just occurring at the first retinal synapse.
