 as a consequence of VHb production was investigated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) in conjunction with peptide mass fingerprinting. Total protein extracts derived from cells expressing native green fluorescent protein (GFPuv) and chimeric VHbGFPuv grown in Luria-Bertani broth were prepared by sonic disintegration. One hundred microgram of proteins was individually electrophoresed in IEF-agarose rod gels followed by gradient SDS-PAGE gels. Protein spots were excised from the gels, digested to peptide fragments by trypsin, and analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Results revealed that expression of VHbGFPuv caused an entire disappearance of tryptophanase as well as down-regulated proteins involved in various metabolic pathways, e.g. glycerol kinase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, and D-glucose-D-galactose binding protein. Phenotypic assay of cellular indole production confirmed the differentially expressed tryptophanase enzymes in which cells expressing chimeric VHbGFP demonstrated a complete indole-negative reaction. Supplementation of δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to the culture medium enhanced expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and glycerol kinase. Our findings herein shed light on the functional roles of VHb on cellular carbon and nitrogen consumptions as well as regulation of other metabolic pathway intermediates, possibly by autoregulation of the catabolite repressor regulons.
