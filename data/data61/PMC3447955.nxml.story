Chemical modifications of chromatin, such as DNA methylation, incorporation of histone variants, or post-translational modifications of histone proteins, constitute the “epigenome” and confer specific properties to genome functions. Epigenomes differ from one individual to another, opening the exciting perspective to decipher the origins of these differences and their impact on physiology. However, population epigenomics remains challenging because, unlike DNA mutations, epigenetic hallmarks are themselves regulated. They can change upon particular environmental conditions, they may be inherited epigenetically, or they may result from activities encoded in the DNA. Thus, estimating the stability of intra-species epigenomic variation and its dependence on DNA polymorphisms is essential. Using a chemical perturbation of yeast cells as an experimental model system, we found that acetylation variation was persistent at some nucleosomes and labile at other nucleosomes. By studying a segregating population, we mapped DNA polymorphisms that affected chromatin acetylation levels at numerous nucleosomes. Strikingly, nucleosomes showing persistent variation of acetylation corresponded to those for which acetylation was under genetic control. Thus, part of epigenomic variation is stabilized by a DNA–encoded determinism, and another part can be reprogrammed if environmental perturbations are experienced. These results provide a necessary basis for upcoming developments in population epigenomics.
