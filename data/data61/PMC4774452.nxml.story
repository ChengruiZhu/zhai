Patients exhibiting pancreatic cancer possess poor rates of survival. Therefore, the identification of a biomarker that can be measured non-invasively and be used to predict patient outcomes is required for the successful treatment of pancreatic cancer. The present study evaluated serum microRNA (miRNA/miR) profiles in patients exhibiting pancreatic cancer, who were treated with lapatinib and capecitabine in a phase II trial. Serum samples were collected for the measurement of a panel of miRNAs (miR-21, miR-210, miR-221 and miR-7) associated with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)1 and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2 pathways. Preclinically, human pancreatic cancer PANC-1, MIA PaCa-2 and BXCP-3 cell lines were utilized for miRNA and drug resistance studies. In total, 6/17 patients treated experienced disease progression following 2 cycles of treatment [non-responders (NRS)], while another 6/17 patients exhibited a stable disease state and received >4 cycles of treatment [responders (RS); range, 4–22 cycles]. Five patients withdrew from the study due to severe toxicity or mortality. The mean overall survival time was 6.5 vs. 10.4 months for NRS and RS, respectively. Significant upregulation of serum miRNAs at earlier time points (3–6 weeks) was observed in NRS. miRNA levels increased with cancer progression, and lapatinib and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; the active form of capecitabine) treatment increased the miRNA levels (specifically miR-210 and miR-221) in the treatment-resistant pancreatic cancer PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cell lines. However, lapatinib and 5-FU treatment did not increase the miRNA levels in the treatment-sensitive BXPC-3 cell line. Inhibition of miR-221 increased the sensitivity of the PANC-1 cells to treatment. In conclusion, an increase in specific serum miRNAs was associated with resistance to lapatinib and capecitabine treatment. Additional investigation is required with regard to the application of the miRNA panel investigated in the present study as a potential predictor of patient responses to anti-EGFR/HER2 treatment.
