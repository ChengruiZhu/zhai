Gambling disorder recently was reclassified under the category “substance-related and addictive disorders.” With regard to the diagnostic criteria, it overlaps a great deal with substance use disorder, i.e., loss of control, craving/withdrawal, and neglect of other areas of life. However, the gambling disorder symptom “chasing one’s losses” is the only criterion absent from substance use disorder. Therefore, special forms of reward (i.e., gain/loss) processing, such as the processing of loss avoidance and loss aversion, have just recently attracted attention among gambling disorder researchers. Because gambling disorder might be considered an addiction in its “pure” form, i.e., without the influence of a drug of abuse, investigating brain volume changes in people with this behavioral addiction is an important task for neuroimaging researchers in exploring the neural signatures of addiction. Because the brain is a complex network, investigation of alterations in functional connectivity has gained interest among gambling disorder researchers in order to get a more complete picture of functional brain changes in people with gambling disorder. However, only a few studies on brain structure and functional connectivity in gambling disorder have been performed so far. This review focuses on brain imaging studies of reward and loss processing, with an emphasis on loss avoidance and aversion as well as brain volume and functional connectivity in gambling disorder.
