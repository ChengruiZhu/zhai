We retrospectively studied 14 patients who had undergone PCL reconstruction using the direct tibial inlay fixation technique from 2009 to 2013, with a mean follow-up of 13.4 months. (6-28 months). The patients were 11males and 3 females with an average age of 29.2 years (17-41 years). Ipsilateral femoral shaft fractures were determined in 2 cases, ipsilateral trochanteric fracture in 1 case and popliteal artery injury in 1 case. Surgery was performed within 2-4 weeks. Spanning-joint external fixation was applied to 2 patients because of gross instability with failure to maintain reduction in a brace. Combined reconstructions involving the posterolateral corner (9/14), anterior cruciate ligament (ACL (11/14)), or medial collateral ligament (MCL (1/14)) were performed. All PCL reconstructions were performed with Achilles allograft. In 1 case with arterial injury, the repair was made by a cardiovascular surgeon. In 2 case, deep infection developed, which was controlled with debridement and antibiotic treatment. Superficial peroneal nerve injury in 1 case was treated with tenolysis in the 6th month, then partial healing was seen at 18 months. In all patients, the preoperative posterior drawer (PD) examination was positive. All patients were evaluated with preoperative and postoperative examination and x-rays. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) evaluation was applied to all patients at the final follow-up.
