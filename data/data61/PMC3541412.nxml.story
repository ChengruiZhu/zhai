The pathophysiology of hypertension or stroke is associated with an excess of ROS generation in the vascular system, and results in induction of various pathological cascades of cerebrovascular damage. We have demonstrated that electron spin resonance methods using a spin trap or spin probe will be useful for understanding redox status under conditions of oxidative stress in the spontaneously hypertensive rat or stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat brain. We have used electron spin resonance imaging and noninvasive L-band electron spin resonance to characterize the higher degree of brain oxidative stress in the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat and spontaneously hypertensive rat than in the Wistar-Kyoto rat brain, and the lower extent of oxidative stress in the spontaneously hypertensive rat than in the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat brain. Indeed, we may be able to confirm propofol medium-chain triglyceride/long-chain triglyceride (MCT/LCT) as neuroprotective anesthesia and crocetin as antioxidant food factor against human stroke after screening for antioxidant properties in stroke models such as stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat. Thus, our electron spin resonance biomedical application suggests that it could be used to assess antioxidant effects on oxidative stress in the brain using spontaneously hypertensive rat and stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat. We hope that further advances in the instrumentation used for electron spin resonance imaging and the development of optimized nontoxic spin probes will make this technology even more promising for novel clinical prediction or noninvasive diagnosis of human stroke. After screening drugs or foods for antioxidant property using
