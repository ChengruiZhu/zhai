_exons_14–20]–V2). Functional mapping by microdeletions revealed essential sequences for exon recognition on the 3’ end of exon 17 (c.7944-7973) and the 5’ end of exon 18 (c.7979-7988, c.7999-8013). Thirty out of the 52 selected variants induced anomalous splicing in minigene assays with >16 different aberrant transcripts, where exon skipping was the most common event. A wide range of splicing motifs were affected including the canonical splice sites (15 variants), novel alternative sites (3 variants), the polypyrimidine tract (3 variants) and enhancers/silencers (9 variants). According to the guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), 20 variants could be classified as pathogenic (c.7806-2A>G, c.7806-1G>A, c.7806-1G>T, c.7806-1_7806-2dup, c.7976+1G>A, c.7977-3_7978del, c.7977-2A>T, c.7977-1G>T, c.7977-1G>C, c.8009C>A, c.8331+1G>T and c.8331+2T>C) or likely pathogenic (c.7806-9T>G, c.7976G>C, c.7976G>A, c.7977-7C>G, c.7985C>G, c.8023A>G, c.8035G>T and c.8331G>A), accounting for 30.8% of all pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants of exons 17–18 at the BRCA Share database. The remaining 8 variants (c.7975A>G, c.7977-6T>G, c.7988A>T, c.7992T>A, c.8007A>G, c.8009C>T, c.8009C>G, and c.8072C>T) induced partial splicing anomalies with important ratios of the full-length transcript (≥70%), so that they remained classified as VUS. Aberrant splicing is therefore especially prevalent in
