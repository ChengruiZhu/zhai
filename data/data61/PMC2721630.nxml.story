Inactivating mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene occur often in the progression of human cancers. p53 inhibits the outgrowth of nascent cancer cells through anti-proliferative actions (including induction of apoptosis or senescence). To test p53 tumor suppressor functions in a novel experimental context, we somatically deleted both p53 alleles in multiple tissues of mice at various ages. Mice homozygously deleted for p53 at 3 months of age showed a longer tumor latency compared to mice deleted for p53 at 6 and 12 months of age. These results are consistent with a model in which tissues accumulate oncogenically activated cells with age and these are held in check by wildtype p53. We also deleted p53 before, concurrent with, and after treatment of mice with ionizing radiation (IR). The absence or presence of p53 during IR treatment had no effect on radiation-induced lymphoma latency, confirming that the immediate p53 damage response was irrelevant for cancer prevention. Even the presence of wildtype p53 for up to four weeks post-IR provided no protection against early lymphoma incidence, indicating that long term maintenance of functional p53 is critical for preventing the emergence of a cancer. These experiments indicate that sustained p53 anti-oncogenic function acts as a final or near final line of defense preventing progression of oncogenically activated cells to malignant tumors.
