The 0.5 M KCl-treatment solubilizes the outer arms from sea urchin sperm axonemes. Approximately 30 percent of A-polypeptide, corresponding to dynein 1 in SDS- polyacrylamide gel, was solubilized by this treatment (as SEA-dynein 1). Electron microscopic observation indicated that the extracted axonemes lacked the outer arms in various degrees. The DEA-dynein 1 was that the extracted axonemes lacked the outer arms in various degrees. The SEA-dyenin 1 was purified and an antiserum against it was prepared in rabbits. The specificity of antiserum to dynein 1 was determined by immunoelectrophoresis and ouchterlonyâ€™s double-diffusion test. The anti-dynein 1 serum inhibited ATPase activity of purified SEA-dynein 1 by 95 percent. By the indirect peroxidase-conjugated antibody method, the loci of SEA-dynein 1 within the intact, salt- extracted and mechanically disrupted axonemes were determined to be the outer arms: deposition of electron-dense materials which represents their localization was detected at the distal ends of the outer arms, in the case of intact axonemes. The 5-6 cross- bridge was hardly decorated. No decoration was seen in the salt-extracted axonemes lacking all the outer arms. In disrupted axonemes, which consist of single to several peripheral doublets, electron-dense materials were deposited only on the outer arms. Approximately 73 percent of axonemal ATPase activity sensitive to antiserum was solubilized by repeated salt-extractions. One-half of A-polypeptide (SEA-dynein 1 located at the outer arms) was contained in the pooled extracts. The extracted axonemes contained another half of A-polypeptide (SUA-dynein 1 supposed to locate at the inner arms) and retained 31 percent of axonemal ATPase activity that was almost resistant to antiserum. Solubilized SUA-dynein 1 was immunologically the same as SEA-dynein 1. This result indicates that in situ SUA-dynein 1 did not receive anti-dynein 1 antibodies, coinciding with the result obtained for salt-extracted axonemes lacking all the outer arms by the enzyme-antibody method mentioned above. These observations suggest that immunological dissimilarity in dynein 1 between outer and inner arms but do not tell us that the inner arms do not contain dynein 1.
