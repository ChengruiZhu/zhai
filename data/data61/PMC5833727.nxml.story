Modulation of sialylation by sialyltransferases and sialidases plays essential role in carcinogenesis. There are few reports on sialyltransferase, however, the contribution of cytosolic sialidase (Neu2) remains unexplored in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We observed lower expression of Neu2 in different PDAC cells, patient tissues, and a significant strong association with clinicopathological characteristics. Neu2 overexpression guided drug-resistant MIAPaCa2 and AsPC1 cells toward apoptosis as evidenced by decreased Bcl2/Bax ratio, activation of caspase-3/caspase-6/caspase-8, PARP reduction, reduced CDK2/CDK4/CDK6, and cyclin-B1/cyclin-E with unaffected caspase-9. Neu2-overexpressed cells exhibited higher expression of Fas/CD95-death receptor, FasL, FADD, and Bid cleavage confirming extrinsic pathway-mediated apoptosis. α2,6-linked sialylation of Fas helps cancer cells to survive, which is a substrate for Neu2. Therefore, their removal should enhance Fas-mediated apoptosis. Neu2-overexpressed cells indeed showed increased enzyme activity even on membrane. Interestingly, this membrane-bound Neu2 exhibited enhanced association with Fas causing its desialylation and activation as corroborated by decreased association of Fas with α2,6-sialic acid-binding lectin. Additionally, enhanced cytosolic Neu2 inhibited the expression of several growth factor-mediated signaling molecules involved in PI3K/Akt–mTOR pathway probably through desialylation which in turn also causes Fas activation. Furthermore, Neu2-overexpressed cells exhibited reduced cell migration, invasion with decreased VEGF, VEGFR, and MMP9 levels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of cytosolic Neu2 on membrane, its association with Fas, enhanced desialylation, activation, and Fas-mediated apoptosis. Taken together, our study ascertains a novel concept by which the function of Fas/CD95 could be modulated indicating a critical role of upstream Neu2 as a promising target for inducing apoptosis in pancreatic cancer.
