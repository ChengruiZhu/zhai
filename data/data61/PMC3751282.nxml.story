A 69-year-old male was admitted to our institution because of a sudden onset of vomiting and abdominal distention. His past history of illness included femoral head fracture, congestive heart failure and ischaemic colitis. Plain abdominal computed tomography revealed extensively dilated small intestinal loops with a calibre change around the end of the ileum. Small intestinal obstruction was diagnosed and a transnasal ileus tube was placed. The ileus tube was constantly moved towards small intestine until it reached the distal ileum. Contrast medium from the ileus tube revealed a distal ileal stricture. Subsequently, transanal single balloon enteroscopy was performed to inspect the stricture, revealing a circumferential and afferent tubular ulcer in the distal ileum, 5 cm from the ileocecal valve; gastrofluorography confirmed the stricture. Although the stricture was dilated on several occasions using balloon catheters, the stricture could not be improved. However, during the treatment, his general condition worsened over time; thus, surgical treatment was decided. Operative findings revealed several circumferential ulcers with a clear margin 5–28 cm from the ileocecal valve: all lesions were successfully resected. Pathological findings were consistent with ischaemic enteritis. We report a case of small intestinal obstruction resulting from stenotic ischaemic enteritis.
