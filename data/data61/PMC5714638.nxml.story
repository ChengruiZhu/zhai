Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a chronic, episodic facial pain syndrome that can be extremely intense, and it occurs within the regions of the face that are innervated by the three branches of the trigeminal nerve. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is the least invasive procedure to treat TN. SRS uses narrow photon beams that require high spatial resolution techniques for their measurement. The use of radiographic or radiochromic films for small‐field dosimetry is advantageous because high spatial resolution and two‐dimensional dose measurements can be performed. Because these films have different properties, it is expected that the calculated dose distributions for TN patients will behave differently, depending on the detector used for the commissioning of the small photon beams. This work is based on two sets of commissioned data: one commissioned with X‐OMAT V2 film and one commissioned with EBT2 film. The calculated dose distributions for 23 TN patients were compared between the commissioning datasets. The variables observed were the differences in the half widths of the 35 and 40 Gy isodose lines (related to the entrance distance to the brainstem) and the volume of the brainstem that received a dose of 12 Gy or more (V12). The results of this comparison showed that there were statistically significant differences between the two calculated dose distributions. The magnitudes of these differences were up to 0.33 mm and 0.38 mm for the 35 and 40 Gy isodose lines. The corresponding difference for the V12 was up to 2.1 cc. It is clear that these differences may impact the treatment of TN patients, and then it must be important to perform this type of analysis when observing complication rates. Clinical reports on irradiation techniques for trigeminal neuralgia should consider that different detectors used for commissioning treatment planning systems might result in small but significant differences in dose distributions.
