Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Adenocarcinoma with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations accounts for 8%â€“30% of all cases of NSCLC depending on the geography and ethnicity. EGFR-mutated NSCLC usually responds to first-line therapy with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, there is eventual loss of efficacy to TKIs due to development of resistance. The most frequent cause for resistance is a second EGFR mutation in exon 20 (T790M), which is encountered in up to 62% of patients. Osimertinib is one of the third-generation EGFR TKIs with a high selective potency against T790M mutants. In Phase I trial of osimertinib in advanced lung cancer after progression on EGFR TKIs, the response rate and disease control rate were 61% and 95%, respectively. A subsequent Phase II (AURA2) trial demonstrated a disease control rate of 92%, a response rate of 71%, a median duration of response of 7.8 months, and a median progression-free survival of 8.6 months. Osimertinib was approved by the US Food & Drug Administration in November 2015 for patients whose tumors exhibited T790M mutation and for those with progressive disease on other EGFR TKIs. In this review, we address the role of EGFR TKIs in the management of EGFR mutation lung cancer and the mechanisms of resistance to TKIs with a focus on the role of osimertinib. Data from completed trials of osimertinib, ongoing trials, as well as novel diagnostic methods to detect
