We investigated the association between dietary intake of n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), serum profiles, and immune and inflammatory markers in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in relation to onset, activity, and duration. A total of 66 JIA patients and 42 controls were included. Serum PUFA levels were assessed by gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, a dietary intake by 7-day dietary record method, and IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17A levels using ELISA. Dietary PUFA intake did not differ between the JIA group and controls. Intakes of n-6 and n-3 PUFA and serum levels were not associated. Levels of total n-6 PUFA and linoleic acid (LA) were higher in inactive JIA than in active JIA. Patients with active and short-lasting disease (less than 3 months from diagnosis) had significantly lower levels of arachidonic acid (AA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) than the control. Serum α-linolenic acid (ALA) levels were significantly higher in poly-JIA than in oligo-JIA and in controls. We found significantly higher serum IL-10 levels in JIA than in controls. Serum n-6 and n-3 levels were significantly negatively correlated with active joint count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein and positively with platelet count. Our study presents the low levels of AA and DHA in the active phase of short-lasting JIA, particularly poly-JIA, and the relationship between n-6 and n-3 PUFA and classic markers of inflammation. PUFAs may contribute to the pathogenesis of JIA and support a necessity to identify new targets suitable for successful interventional studies in JIA patients.
