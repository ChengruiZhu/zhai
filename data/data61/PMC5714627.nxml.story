The purpose of this study was to quantify the performance and agreement between two different external surrogate acquisition systems: Varian's Real‐Time Position Management (RPM) and Philips Medical Systems' pneumatic bellows, in the context of waveform and 4D CT image analysis. Eight patient displacement curves derived from RPM data were inputted into a motion platform with varying amplitudes (0.5 to 3 cm) and patterns. Simultaneous 4D CT acquisition, with synchronized X‐ray on detection, was performed with the bellows and RPM block placed on the platform. Bellows data were used for online retrospective phase‐based sorting, while RPM data were used for off‐line reconstruction of raw 4D CT data. RPM and bellows breathing curves were resampled, normalized, and analyzed to determine associations between different external surrogates, relative amplitude differences, and system latency. Maximum intensity projection (MIP) images were generated, phantom targets were delineated, and volume differences, overlap index, and Dice similarity coefficient differences were evaluated. A prospective patient study of ten patients was performed and waveforms were evaluated for latency (i.e., absolute time differences) and overall agreement. 4D CT sorting quality and subtraction images were assessed. Near perfect associations between the RPM and bellows‐acquired breathing traces were found
