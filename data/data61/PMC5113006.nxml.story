A common method of evaluating stemness among pluripotent cells or cancer cells is the side population assay, a flow cytometry technique which identifies a subgroup of cells that exhibit differences in dye fluorescence upon blocking of a membrane transporter. A technical limitation of this assay is that it relies on two independent experimental conditions, with and without a transporter inhibitor, preventing evaluation of single cell characteristics that generate population-level shifts in fluorescence. Here, the computational implementation of various forms of cellular heterogeneity allows for ensemble single-cell simulations to be performed in order to assess the underlying properties that give rise to the population-level behavior. We simulated staining in 10,000 kinetic ensembles consisting of 1,000-cell populations with and without inhibitor to determine which cells respond in the assay. We quantitatively establish that a small, responsive subgroup of cells with nonlinear activities associated with transporter number are most likely to recapitulate observed behavior in the side population assay; however, a continuum of phenotypes at different stages of the cell cycle and with a range transporter expression levels will shift fluorescence. We present a new perspective on the phenotype of SP cells at the single-cell level that is determined by biological and experimental kinetic processes, and is not equivalent to a cancer stem cell phenotype.
