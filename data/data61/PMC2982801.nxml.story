The canonical Wnt pathway is a key regulatory pathway controlling intestinal cell proliferation, differentiation, and stem cell maintenance, and its deregulation leads to malignancies in the mammalian gut. A decade has passed since the discovery of the transcription factors TCF4-β-catenin as the downstream intestinal molecular effectors of Wnt, but few transcriptional activators essential and unique to the regulation of this transcription program have been found. In this study, using a proteomics approach, we identify the leukemia-associated Mllt10/Af10 and its partner the histone methyltransferase Dot1l as interactors with Tcf4/β-catenin in the mouse small intestinal epithelium. We demonstrate that Mllt10/Af10–Dot1l are recruited to Wnt target genes in intestinal epithelial cells and are essential to regulate expression of these targets. We also show a genetic link between the Wnt pathway and Mllt10/Af10-Dot1l in zebrafish and delineate their essential role in Wnt-driven endogenous gene expression. Finally, we demonstrate the physiological role of Mllt10/Af10-Dot1l in Wnt-driven intestinal development and homeostasis; depletion of Mllt10/Af10-Dot1l in zebrafish embryos mimics the Tcf4-depleted phenotype in which significant intestinal proliferation defects accompany a decrease in total number of intestinal cells. We conclude that the enzyme Dot1l may present an attractive candidate for drug targeting in colorectal cancer.
