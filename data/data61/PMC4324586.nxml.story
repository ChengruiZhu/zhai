Personalized therapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly lung adenocarcinoma, has recently been significantly improved by the discovery of various molecular targets. However, this has not been the case for lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). In the present study, we identified the family with sequence similarity 83, member B (FAM83B) as a candidate marker for SCC through a comprehensive gene expression analysis and examined its correlations with various clinicopathological factors. The subjects of this study consisted of 215 patients with NSCLC who underwent complete resection from 2005 to 2011 at the Fukushima Medical University Hospital (Fukushima, Japan). They included 102 patients with adenocarcinoma and 113 with SCC. FAM83B expression was first examined in some of the samples by gene expression analysis and western blotting, and then all clinical specimens were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The relationship between the quantitative values for IHC and clinicopathological factors was statistically analyzed. The results showed that FAM83B mRNA expression was significantly higher in SCC than in normal lung or adenocarcinoma (P<0.0001). Immunoblot analysis also confirmed this trend. Specimens containing >10% positive area for FAM83B were judged as ‘positive’; 94.3% (107/113) of SCC and 14.7% (15/102) of adenocarcinoma were positive. Patients were divided into two subgroups according to expression (54 high-expression and 53 low-expression patients); the high-expression group was associated with a better disease-free survival (DFS) rate (P=0.042, log-rank test). In conclusion, FAM83B may be a reliable diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for SCC. Detailed analyses of FAM83B function in lung cancer are required to understand how its expression is associated with better prognosis in SCC.
