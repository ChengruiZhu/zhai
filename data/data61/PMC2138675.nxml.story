 infection in mice. The development of the host's immune response is revealed by a progressive change in the slope of the bacterial growth curve in spleen and liver. It has its onset at 24 hr in untreated mice, but in the presence of effective immunosuppression the organism multiples uninterruptedly until the animal dies from overwhelming infection. When administered as single injections at the time of infection, cyclophosphamide, vinblastine, and azathioprine all produced an effective immunosuppression, characterized by continuous bacterial multiplication. Methotrexate was also immunosuppressive, but unlike the others its effects were reversible. They could be sustained, however, by further treatment. Studies of the time-response relationship indicated that cyclophosphamide was highly active over a broad time-span ranging from 2 days before infection to 4 days after infection. Vinblastine on the other hand was maximally active when given on the day of infection, while methotrexate had its greatest effect when given 48 hr after infection. These differences indicate that these three drugs act on different cell populations involved in the host's immune response. The effects observed have been discussed in relation to what is known of the modes of action of the drugs tested. An observation of interest was the phenomenon of enhanced immunity in animals treated with cyclophosphamide or vinblastine 7â€“11 days before, and with methotrexate 4 days before infection; reactive hyperplasia of lymphoid tissue following withdrawal of drug was again advanced as an explanation for the occurrence of this paradoxical effect. The experimental model employed is simple, requiring only routine bacteriological facilities and minimal equipment. It seems to offer a useful means of assessing the immunosuppressive activity of drugs and of determining the time-course of their action; it could also be of value in the screening of anticancer agents.
