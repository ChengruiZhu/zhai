Alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG), an endogenous intermediary metabolite in the Krebs cycle, is a molecule involved in multiple metabolic and cellular pathways. It functions as an energy donor, a precursor in the amino acid biosynthesis, a signalling molecule, as well as a regulator of epigenetic processes and cellular signalling via protein binding. AKG is an obligatory co-substrate for 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, which catalyse hydroxylation reactions on various types of substrates. It regulates the activity of prolyl-4 hydroxylase, which controls the biosynthesis of collagen, a component of bone tissue. AKG also affects the functioning of prolyl hydroxylases, which, in turn, influences the function of the hypoxia-inducible factor, an important transcription factor in cancer development and progression. Additionally, it affects the functioning of enzymes that influence epigenetic modifications of chromatin: tenâ€“eleven translocation hydroxylases involved in DNA demethylation and the Jumonji C domain containing lysine demethylases, which are the major histone demethylases. Thus, it regulates gene expression. The metabolic and extrametabolic function of AKG in cells and the organism open many different fields for therapeutic interventions for treatment of diseases. This review presents the results of studies conducted with the use of AKG in states of protein deficiency and oxidative stress conditions. It also discusses current knowledge about AKG as an immunomodulatory agent and a bone anabolic factor. Additionally, the regulatory role of AKG and its structural analogues in carcinogenesis as well as the results of studies of AKG as an anticancer agent are discussed.
