Excessive calcium is thought to be a critical step in various neurodegenerative processes including ischemia. Calbindin D28k (CB), calretinin (CR), and parvalbumin (PV), members of the EF-hand calcium-binding protein family, are thought to play a neuroprotective role in various pathologic conditions by serving as a buffer against excessive calcium. The expression of CB, PV and CR in the ischemic rat retina induced by increasing intraocular pressure was investigated at the transcript and protein levels, by means of the quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blot and immunohistochemistry. The transcript and protein levels of CB, which is strongly expressed in the horizontal cells in both normal and affected retinas, were not changed significantly and the number of CB-expressing horizontal cells remained unchanged throughout the experimental period 8 weeks after ischemia/reperfusion injury. At both the transcript and protein levels, however, CR, which is strongly expressed in several types of amacrine, ganglion, and displaced amacrine cells in both normal and affected retinas, was decreased. CR-expressing ganglion cell number was particularly decreased in ischemic retinas. Similar to the CR, PV transcript and protein levels, and PV-expressing AII amacrine cell number were decreased. Interestingly, in ischemic retinas PV was transiently expressed in putative cone bipolar cell types possibly those that connect with AII amacrine cells via gap junctions. These results suggest that these three calcium binding proteins may play different neuroprotective roles in ischemic insult by their ability to buffer calcium in the rat retina.
