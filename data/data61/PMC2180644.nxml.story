The mode of action of 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) on the primary immune response in vitro was investigated. Fetal calf serum (FCS) was preincubated with 2-ME and lyophilized to remove free 2-ME. This 2-ME- treated FCS was able to substitute the function of adherent cells in the primary immune response against sheep red blood cells (SRBC) in vitro; Fractionation of 2-tme-treated FCS on a Sephadex G-100 column showed that 2-ME acted on a high molecular serum component which after activation, could substitute for macrophages. In order to obtain a humoral immune response against SRBC in vitro, spleen cells require selected FCS. These "good" sera could be distinguished from "deficient" sera by their higher content of this 2-ME-activated factor. The height of the in vitro immune response to SRBC was dependent on the amount of activated factor added to the culture medium. FCS normally required in the culture medium could be completely replaced by the factor- containing fraction without deleterious effect on the culture medium. The factor should be added to the spleen cells during the first 24 h of culture and remain there for 72 h in order to obtain an optimal immune response. The factor could be partially absorbed by spleen cells but not by SRBC. The relationship between macrophage, 2-ME, and FCS in eliciting an in vitro primary immune response is discussed.
