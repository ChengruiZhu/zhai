Through the hematopoietic system, all the distinct mature blood cell types are generated, thereby constituting one of the best-studied paradigms for cell lineage commitment and differentiation in biology. B lymphocytes are generated through several cell-commitment, lineage-choice, and differentiation processes. To date, the central role of lineage-specific transcription factors in positively regulating these distinct developmental steps is well established. However, in the absence of proper transcriptional repression, an “adolescent cell” will never be able to reach its “adulthood identity,” having a potential impact in the development of hematological malignancies. In this article, we examined the molecular mechanism responsible for the gene silencing of lineage undesirable genes in B cell precursors and uncovered the role played in this process by the histone deacetylase HDAC7. We show that HDAC7 is expressed in B cell precursors where it interacts with the transcription factor MEF2C and is recruited to the promoters of non-B cell genes. While HDAC7 is down-regulated during the lineage conversion of pre-B cells into macrophages, re-expression of HDAC7 interferes with both the acquisition of the myeloid gene transcriptional program and macrophage-specific cell functions. We therefore have identified a novel lineage-specific transcriptional repressor in the hematopoietic system.
