31 patients underwent ICB fixation of chronic and acute distal biceps tendon ruptures without allograft with more than 1 year follow up. 21 patients completed a questionnaire and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) survey. Elbow and forearm ROM, cosmesis, pain, strength, motor nerve neuropraxia, cutaneous sensory changes and other complications were obtained from the chart and questionnaire. The ICB technique utilizes a 4cm transverse anterior incision 2cm distal to the distal antecubital flexion crease. The tuberosity is prepared, creating a clean, bleeding bony surface. A #2 high-strength braided suture is passed through the toggle hole at both ends of a Smith and Nephew Endobutton. A needle passes one suture pair in the 4.7mm hole and out the 2mm hole drilled with mild convergence in the distal and proximal tuberosity footprint with a 1.5cm bony bridge. This suture pair shuttles the Endobutton into the intramedullary canal, both limbs of each suture exits their respective hole. One limb from each suture is whipstitched proximally and back distally. Tensioning the free suture limb exiting the 2mm hole and tying to its free suture pair compresses the biceps stump against the radial tuberosity and secures the Endobutton against the intramedullary cortex at the 2mm hole. Finally the free suture limb exiting the 4.7mm hole is tensioned and tied to its suture pair limb, distributing tendon compression over the entire tuberosity footprint.
