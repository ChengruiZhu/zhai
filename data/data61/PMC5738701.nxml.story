The 14-3-3 protein family may regulates protein interaction, transportation and cellular localization. The regulatory role of 14-3-3ε is influenced by its altered localization. In the present study, human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells were treated with curcumin to induce apoptosis. Subsequently, the altered expression and localization of 14-3-3ε and its co-localization with other apoptosis-associated proteins during apoptosis was investigated. Analysis of nuclear matrix proteins (NMPs), using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, revealed that 14-3-3ε existed on the nuclear matrix of MG-63 cells, and its expression was decreased compared with that in control cells following curcumin treatment. In addition, western blot analysis validated that the expression level of 14-3-3ε was downregulated during curcumin-induced apoptosis of MG-63 cells compared with that in control cells. Using immunofluorescence labeling, it was observed that 14-3-3ε was located on the nuclear matrix of MG-63 cells and the distribution of 14-3-3ε on the nuclear matrix was decreased following treatment with curcumin, compared with that in control cells. Double immunofluorescence staining and laser-scanning confocal microscopy demonstrated that 14-3-3ε was co-localized with B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated-X protein, p53 and c-FOS transcription factor in MG-63 cells. Furthermore, following treatment with curcumin, these co-localization regions were decreased. The results of the present study revealed that 14-3-3ε is an NMP in MG-63 cells, and its altered expression and co-localization with apoptosis-associated proteins indicated an important function of 14-3-3ε in apoptosis of MG-63 cells. Additional studies are required to investigate the results of the present study.
