The researchers started with a systematic search of the medical literature for RCTs that tested RAS blockers alone or in combination in adults with diabetes. They also contacted the sponsors of many studies to find out whether they had additional data that were not included in the published reports. They included all trials that had at least 100 participants, followed the participants for at least 12 months, and reported cardiovascular or renal outcomes. In all, 71 trials that tested a total of 14 different treatment regimens in 103,120 participants met these criteria. With network meta-analysis, the researchers were able to summarize the results of all these trials in a meaningful way. They did this by integrating direct comparisons of RAS blockers within the same trial (where those were available) with indirect comparisons across all trials. The primary endpoints in their analysis were major cardiovascular outcome (a composite of cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal heart attack, and nonfatal stroke) and progression of renal disease (a composite of end-stage renal disease, doubling of serum creatinine [a marker of reduced kidney function], and all-cause mortality). They also analyzed the individual cardiovascular or renal outcomes separately, but these results carried more uncertainty because fewer patients had the individual, compared with the combined, outcomes.
