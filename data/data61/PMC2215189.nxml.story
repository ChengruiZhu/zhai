Unpoisoned sartorius muscles of Rana temporaria were stimulated tetanically in isometric contractions lasting up to 20 s at 0 degrees C. The observed enthalpy (heat + work) production and the chemical changes in these contractions were measured, and a comparison was made between the observed enthalpy and the enthalpy that could be explained by the chemical changes. Like earlier workers, we found that the only net known reaction of energetic significance that occurred was dephosphorylation of n-phosphoryl creatine (PC), and we found a significant evolution of unexplained enthalpy (UE), a portion of the observed enthalpy which could not be explained by the extent of PC dephosphorylation. We measured the total quantity and the rate of production of the UE, and we found that its rate of evolution, which was most rapid during the first 750 ms of contraction, fell progressively to zero by the 8th s of contraction: i.e., after 8 s of contraction, all the observed enthalpy is adequately explained by PC dephosphorylation. The time-course of evolution of the UE was slower than that of the labile enthalpy (a component of the enthalpy evolved in isometric contraction whose rate of production declines exponentially at approximately 1 s-1). We conclude that, although the magnitudes of these enthalpy quantities may be similar, they are not derived from the same chemical reaction in muscle.
