The development of biophysical systems that enable an understanding of the structure and ligand‐binding properties of G‐quadruplex (GQ)‐forming nucleic acid sequences in cells or models that mimic the cellular environment would be highly beneficial in advancing GQ‐directed therapeutic strategies. Herein, the establishment of a biophysical platform to investigate the structure and recognition properties of human telomeric (H‐Telo) DNA and RNA repeats in a cell‐like confined environment by using conformation‐sensitive fluorescent nucleoside probes and a widely used cellular model, bis(2‐ethylhexyl) sodium sulfosuccinate reverse micelles (RMs), is described. The 2′‐deoxy and ribonucleoside probes, composed of a 5‐benzofuran uracil base analogue, faithfully report the aqueous micellar core through changes in their fluorescence properties. The nucleoside probes incorporated into different loops of H‐Telo DNA and RNA oligonucleotide repeats are minimally perturbing and photophysically signal the formation of respective GQ structures in both aqueous buffer and RMs. Furthermore, these sensors enable a direct comparison of the binding affinity of a ligand to H‐Telo DNA and RNA GQ structures in the bulk and confined environment of RMs. These results demonstrate that this combination of a GQ nucleoside probe and easy‐to‐handle RMs could provide new opportunities to study and devise screening‐compatible assays in a cell‐like environment to discover GQ binders of clinical potential.
