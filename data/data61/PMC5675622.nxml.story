Studies have showed that dysfunction in the breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) is associated with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC); however, its effect on patient survival remains controversial. We investigated the distribution of BRCA1/2 mutations in unselected Chinese patients with TNBC and explored their roles in prognosis. Then a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to evaluate the prognostic role of BRCA dysfunction, including BRCA1/2 germline/somatic mutations, BRCA1 promoter methylation, and low BRCA1 protein expression in TNBC patients. Pooled hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals were estimated to determine the association between BRCA dysfunction and survival. Our results showed a high frequency of BRCA1/2 mutations, especially germline BRCA1 variants, were associated with bilateral breast cancer. Although no correlations were found between BRCA1/2 mutations and recurrence-free survival (RFS) or overall survival (OS). In the meta-analysis, patients with BRCA1 promoter methylation showed poor OS. However, there was a favorable impact on disease free survival (DFS) for TNBC patients with BRCA1 promoter methylation when received adjuvant-chemotherapy. In conclusion, BRCA1/2 mutations were associated with bilateral breast cancer and BRCA1 promoter methylation may have a prognostic effect on TNBC.
