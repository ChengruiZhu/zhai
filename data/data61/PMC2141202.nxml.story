 1. In concentrations of 70 to 75 per cent the organic solvents methyl, ethyl, and propyl alcohols, and acetone cause complete precipitation of serum proteins and produce maximum loss in solubility. We have referred to this concentration range as the critical concentration. 2. As the concentration of the solvents is increased from about 75 per cent precipitation continues complete but loss in solubility progressively decreases until at all concentrations above about 87 per cent the precipitates formed at room temperature are completely soluble. 3. The degree of resolubility of the precipitates formed even in these high concentrations of the organic solvent decreases as the temperature is raised and as the duration of exposure is increased. 4. At 5Â°C. the precipitates formed in all concentrations of these organic solvents are completely resoluble. Also these solvents exert maximum precipitating effect at lower temperature. 5. Maximum precipitating effect by these organic solvents occurs at about pH 6.0 precipitation becoming progressively less as the pH value is altered either way from this point. 6. The more concentrated the serum, the greater the proportion of protein present that will be precipitated by any given concentrations of organic solvent. 7. A method for preparing dry immune sera has been given. Such dried sera have been extracted with a number of organic compounds without loss in solubility or antibody activity.
