 tests and Spearman's ρ for the nonparametric bi-variant correlation analysis. Overall survival was determined using the log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. The expression level of XIAP was increased in CIN and cervical carcinoma tissues compared with normal cervical tissues, whereas Smac demonstrated a converse expression pattern to XIAP in these tissues. The positive staining level of XIAP protein was increased in grade 3 CIN compared with that in grade 1–2 CIN, and was significantly higher in the less-differentiated tissue of cervical carcinoma compared with the well- or medium-differentiated tissues (P<0.05). The staining level was also significantly increased in cervical carcinoma with stage 2b-3 compared with tissues from stage 1–2a carcinoma (P<0.05). The expression levels of Smac were in opposition to these results. XIAP was associated with pelvic lymph node metastasis, whereas no association was identified with Smac expression. The expression level of XIAP was significantly and negatively associated with cell survival time in cervical carcinoma, whereas the expression level of Smac was significantly and positively associated with cell survival time in cervical carcinoma. Therefore, XIAP and Smac may participate in the development of cervical cancer. The expression levels of XIAP and Smac were significantly and inversely associated. This may be useful in early diagnosis, evaluation of surgery and chemotherapy and the prognosis of cervical carcinoma.
