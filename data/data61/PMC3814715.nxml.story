Transmission of signals across the cell membrane is an essential process for all living organisms. Integrins are one example of cell surface receptors (αβ) which, uniquely, form a bidirectional signalling pathway across the membrane. Integrins are crucial for many cellular processes and play key roles in pathological defects such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer. They are activated to a high affinity state by the intracellular protein talin in a process known as ‘inside-out activation’. Despite their importance and the existence of functional and structural data, the mechanism by which talin activates integrin remains elusive. In this study we use a multi-scale computational approach, which combines coarse-grained and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, to suggest how the formation of the complex between the talin head domain, the cell membrane and the integrin moves the integrin equilibrium towards an active state. Our results show that conformational changes within the talin head domains optimize its interactions with the cell membrane. Upon binding to the integrin, talin facilitates rearrangement of the integrin TM region thus promoting integrin activation. This study also provides a demonstration of the strengths of a computational multi-scale approach in studies of membrane interactions and receptor conformational changes and associated proteins that enable transmembrane signaling.
