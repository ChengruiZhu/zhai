Intracellular microelectrode techniques were employed to study the effect of cyclic AMP on apical membrane Cl-/HCO3- exchange and electrodiffusive HCO3- transport in Necturus gallbladder epithelium. Intracellular cAMP levels were raised by addition of either the phosphodiesterase inhibitor theophylline (3 X 10(-3) M) or the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin (10(-5) M) to the serosal bathing solution. Measurements of pH in a poorly buffered control mucosal solution upon stopping superfusion show acidification, owing to secretion of both H+ and HCO3-. When the same experiment is performed after addition of amiloride or removal of Na+ from the mucosal bathing medium, alkalinization is observed since H+ transport is either inhibited or reversed, whereas HCO3- secretion persists. The changes in pH in both amiloride or Na-free medium were significantly decreased in theophylline-treated tissues. Theophylline had no effect on the initial rates of fall of intracellular Cl- activity (aCli) upon reducing mucosal solution [Cl-] to either 10 or 0 mM, although membrane voltage and resistance measurements were consistent with stimulation of apical membrane electrodiffusive Cl- permeability. Estimates of the conductive flux, obtained by either reducing simultaneously mucosal [Cl-] and [HCO3-] or lowering [Cl-] alone in the presence of a blocker of anion exchange (diphenylamine-2-carboxylate), indicate that elevation of intracellular cAMP inhibited the anion exchanger by approximately 50%. Measurements of net Cl- uptake upon increasing mucosal Cl- from nominally zero to levels ranging from 2.5 to 100 mM suggest that the mechanism of inhibition is a decrease in Vmax. Consistent with these results, the rate of intracellular alkalinization upon reducing external Cl- was also inhibited significantly by theophylline. Reducing mucosal solution [HCO3-] from 10 to 1 mM under control conditions caused intracellular acidification and an increase in aCli. Theophylline inhibited both changes, by 62 and 32%, respectively. These data indicate that elevation of intracellular cAMP inhibits apical membrane anion (Cl-/HCO3-) exchange. Studies of the effects of rapid changes in mucosal [HCO3-] on membrane voltages and the apparent ratio of membrane resistances, both in the presence and in the absence of theophylline, with or without Cl- in the mucosal solution, do not support the hypothesis that cAMP produces a sizable increase in apical membrane electrodiffusive HCO3- permeability.
