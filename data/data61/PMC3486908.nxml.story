Cellular metabolism is a key element in human physiology. Ideally the metabolic network needs to be considered within the context of the surrounding tissue and organism since the various levels of biological organization are mutually influencing each other. To mechanistically describe the interplay between intracellular space and extracellular environment, we here integrate the genome-scale metabolic network model HepatoNet1 at the cellular scale into physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models at the whole-body level. The resulting multiscale model allows the quantitative description of metabolic behavior in the context of time-resolved metabolite concentration profiles in the body and the surrounding liver tissue. The model has been applied to three case studies covering fundamental aspects of medicine and pharmacology: drug administration, biomarker identification and drug-induced toxication. Most notably, our multiscale approach fosters an improved quantitative understanding of drug action and the impact of metabolic disorders at an organism level, based on a genome-scale representation of cellular metabolism. Computational models such as the one presented include various aspects of human physiology and may therefore significantly support rational approaches in medical diagnostics and pharmaceutical drug development in the future.
