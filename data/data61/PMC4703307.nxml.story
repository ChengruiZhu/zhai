Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most prevalent fatal motor neuron disease. It was identified ~140 years ago, but the exact mechanism underlying the disease has still not been well defined. TAR-DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) was identified as the major component of the proteinaceous inclusions present in ~97% ALS and ~45% frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients, and has also been observed in an increasing spectrum of other neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease. The TDP-43 C-terminus is a key domainâ€”it encodes a prion-like domain and, crucially, hosts almost all ALS-causing mutations. Here we have successfully determined the conformations, dynamics, and self-associations of the prion-like domains of both wild type and three ALS-causing mutants in both aqueous solutions and membrane environments. The study suggests that the TDP-43 prion-like domain appears to have a unique energy landscape, which allows the assembly of the wild-type sequence into specific oligomers only under very limited conditions. Intriguingly, ALS-causing point mutations remodel the energy landscape to favor amyloid formation or irreversible aggregation, thus supporting the emerging view that pathologic aggregation may occur via the exaggeration of functionally important assemblies. Furthermore, the coupled capacity of TDP-43 in aggregation and membrane interaction may partly account for its high neurotoxicity; decoupling these may therefore represent a promising therapeutic strategy to treat TDP-43-mediated neurodegenerative diseases.
