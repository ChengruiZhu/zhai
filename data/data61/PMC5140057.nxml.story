When cells duplicate their genome, the replication machinery is constantly at risk of encountering obstacles, including unusual DNA structures, bound proteins, or transcribing polymerases and transcripts. Cells possess DNA helicases that facilitate movement of the replication fork through such obstacles. Here, we report the discovery that one of these DNA helicases, Rrm3, is also required for restricting DNA synthesis under replication stress. We find that the site in Rrm3 critical for this new replication function is also required for binding a subunit of the replication origin recognition complex, which raises the possibility that Rrm3 controls replication by affecting initiation. This is supported by our finding that Rrm3 associates with a subset of replication origins. Rrm3â€™s ability to restrict replication does not require its helicase activity or the phosphorylation site that regulates this activity. Notably, cells need error-free bypass pathways and homologous recombination to deal with DNA lesions that arise when the helicase function of Rrm3 is disrupted, but not when its replication function is disrupted. This indicates that the DNA lesions that form in the absence of the two distinct Rrm3 function are different, although both activate the DNA-damage checkpoint and are toxic to cells that lack the mediator of the replication checkpoint Mrc1.
