Spatial analytical techniques and models are often used in epidemiology to identify spatial anomalies (hotspots) in disease regions. These analytical approaches can be used to identify not only the location of such hotspots, but also their spatial patterns. We used spatial autocorrelation methodologies, including Global Moran's I and Local Getis-Ord statistics, to describe and map spatial clusters and areas in which nine malignant neoplasms are situated in Taiwan. In addition, we used a logistic regression model to test the characteristics of similarity and dissimilarity between males and females and to formulate the common spatial risk. The mean found by local spatial autocorrelation analysis was used to identify spatial cluster patterns. We found a significant relationship between the leading malignant neoplasms and well-documented spatial risk factors. For instance, in Taiwan, the geographic distribution of clusters where oral cavity cancer in males is prevalent was closely correspond to the locations in central Taiwan with serious metal pollution. In females, clusters of oral cavity cancer were closely related with aboriginal townships in eastern Taiwan, where cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, and betel nut chewing are commonplace. The difference between males and females in the spatial distributions was stark. Furthermore, areas with a high morbidity of gastric cancer were clustered in aboriginal townships where the occurrence of
