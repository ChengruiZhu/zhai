RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) acts as a damage sensor for transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) and undergoes proteolytic clearance from damaged chromatin by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Here, we report that Valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97, a druggable oncotarget, is essential for RNAPII's proteolytic clearance in mammalian cells. We show that inhibition of VCP/p97, or siRNA-mediated ablation of VCP/p97 and its cofactors UFD1 and UBXD7 severely impairs ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-induced RNAPII degradation. VCP/p97 interacts with RNAPII, and the interaction is enhanced by Cockayne syndrome B protein (CSB). However, the VCP/p97-mediated RNAPII proteolysis occurs independent of CSB. Surprisingly, CSB enhances UVR-induced RNAPII ubiquitination but delays its turnover. Additionally, VCP/p97-mediated RNAPII turnover occurs with and without Von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL), a known substrate receptor of Elongin E3 ubiquitin ligase for RNAPII. Moreover, pVHL re-expression improves cell viability following UVR. Whereas, VCP/p97 inhibition decreases cell viability and enhances a low-dose UVR killing in presence of pVHL. These findings reveal a function of VCP/p97 segregase in UVR-induced RNAPII degradation in mammalian cells, and suggest a role of CSB in coordinating VCP/p97-mediated extraction of ubiquitinated RNAPII and CSB itself from chromatin.
