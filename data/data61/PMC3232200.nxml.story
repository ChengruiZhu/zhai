An intricate interaction between genetic and environmental factors influences the development of obesity and diabetes. Previous studies have shown that mice lacking an important receptor of the innate immune system, Toll-like Receptor 2 (TLR2), are protected from insulin resistance. Given that the innate immune system has emerged as a key regulator of the gut microbiota, we undertook to investigate in this study whether the gut microbiota have a role in modulating the response to insulin. By rearing these TLR2 mutant mice in conventional facilities (as opposed to “germ-free” conditions) we figured that they would develop an altered gut microbiota. In contrast to previous studies, our results show that these TLR2 mutant mice now develop a diseased phenotype reminiscent of metabolic syndrome, including weight gain, and end up with gut microbiota similar to that found in obese mice and humans. These mice could be rescued by treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, which decimated the microbiota. Conversely, transplantation of the gut microbiota from these mice to wild-type mice induced weight gain and the metabolic syndrome phenotype. Our results indicate that the gut microbiota per se can subvert a genetically predetermined condition previously described as being protective towards obesity and insulin resistance into a phenotype associated with weight gain and its complications, such as glucose intolerance and diabetes.
