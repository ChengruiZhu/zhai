In all organisms from yeasts to mammals the target of rapamycin TORC1 pathway controls growth in response to nutrients such as leucine, but the leucine sensing mechanisms are only partially characterized. We show that both leucine and its α-ketoacid metabolite, α-ketoisocaproate, are similarly capable of activating TORC1 kinase via EGOC GTPase-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Activation of TORC1 by leucine or α-ketoisocaproate is only partially mediated via EGOC-GTPase. Leucine and α-ketoisocaproate are interconverted by ubiquitous branched-chain aminotransferases (BCAT). Disruption of BCAT caused reduced TORC1 activity, which was partially restored by expression of BCAT active site mutants, arguing for both structural and catalytic roles of BCAT in TORC1 control. We find BCAT interacts with several branched-chain amino acid metabolic enzymes, and in a leucine-dependent fashion with the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)-cycle enzyme aconitase. Both aconitase mutation or TCA-cycle inhibition impaired TORC1 activity. Mutation of BCAT resulted in a TCA-cycle intermediate profile consistent with a TCA-cycle block, low ATP levels, activation of AMPK, and TORC1 inhibition. Our results suggest a model whereby BCAT coordinates leucine and TCA cycle metabolism to control TORC1 signaling. Taken together, our findings forge key insights into how the TORC1 signaling cascade senses nutrients to control cell growth.
