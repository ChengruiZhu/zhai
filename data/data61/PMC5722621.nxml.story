Our method involves using planning computed tomography (PCT) images acquired with a conventional CT simulator and cone‐beam computed tomography (CBCT) images acquired daily by a linear accelerator–mounted kilovoltage image system in the treatment delivery room. The deformation that occurs between the PCT and daily CBCT images is obtained using a modified version of the B‐Spline deformable model designed to overcome the low soft‐tissue contrast and the artifacts and distortions observed in CBCT images. Clinical CBCT images and contours of phantom and central nervous system cases were deformed (warped) with known random deformations. In registering the deformed with the non‐deformed image sets, we tracked the algorithm's ability to recover the original, non‐deformed set. Registration error was measured as the mean and maximum difference between the original and the registered surface contours from outlined structures. Using this approach, two sets of tests can be devised. To measure the residual error related to the optimizer's convergence performance, the warped CBCT image is registered to the unwarped version of itself, eliminating unknown factors such as noise and positioning errors. To study additional errors introduced by artifacts and noise in the CBCT image, the warped CBCT image is registered to the original PCT image.
