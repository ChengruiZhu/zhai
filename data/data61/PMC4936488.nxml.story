Bariatric surgery has emerged as a viable treatment option in morbidly obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. Concomitant with societal lifestyle changes and the increased emphasis on achieving metabolic targets, there has been a rise in the number of patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) who are overweight and obese. Preliminary experience based on a limited number of observational reports points to substantial weight loss and amelioration of comorbid conditions such as blood pressure and dyslipidemia in patients with T1DM who undergo weight loss surgery. However, there is little evidence to suggest significant improvement in glycemic control and lowering of glycosylated hemoglobin, and bariatric surgical procedures do not necessarily lead to enhanced diabetes management. and improved quality of life. The potential possibility of micronutrient deficiency, weight regain, and psychobehavioral issues post-bariatric surgery also exists. An individualized evaluation of the risks and benefits should be considered, using a a multidisciplinary team approach with expertise in patient selection, surgical technique, and follow-up. A crucial component is the availability of a diabetes care specialist or endocrinologist experienced in intensive, tailored, modifiable insulin regimens who maintains close and careful monitoring during all phases of management. Reliable data from a prospective, longitudinal perspective is required to provide guidelines for clinicians and informed choices for obese patients with T1DM who are contemplating bariatric surgery.
