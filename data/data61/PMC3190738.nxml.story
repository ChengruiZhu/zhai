The toroid-shaped nuclear protein export factor CRM1 is constructed from 21 tandem HEAT repeats, each of which contains an inner (B) and outer (A) Î±-helix joined by loops. Proteins targeted for export have a nuclear export signal (NES) that binds between the A-helices of HEAT repeats 11 and 12 on the outer surface of CRM1. RanGTP binding increases the affinity of CRM1 for NESs. In the absence of RanGTP, the CRM1 C-terminal helix, together with the HEAT repeat 9 loop, modulates its affinity for NESs. Here we show that there is an electrostatic interaction between acidic residues at the extreme distal tip of the C-terminal helix and basic residues on the HEAT repeat 12 B-helix that lies on the inner surface of CRM1 beneath the NES binding site. Small angle x-ray scattering indicates that the increased affinity for NESs generated by mutations in the C-terminal helix is not associated with large scale changes in CRM1 conformation, consistent with the modulation of NES affinity being mediated by a local change in CRM1 near the NES binding site. These data also suggest that in the absence of RanGTP, the C-terminal helix lies across the CRM1 toroid in a position similar to that seen in the CRM1-Snurportin crystal structure. By creating local changes that stabilize the NES binding site in its closed conformation and thereby reducing the affinity of CRM1 for NESs, the C-terminal helix and HEAT 9 loop facilitate release of NES-containing cargo in the cytoplasm and also inhibit their return to the nucleus.
