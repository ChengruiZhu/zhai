Gene expression regulators, such as transcription factors and microRNAs, are critical actors in cellular physiology and pathophysiology and act by modulating the expression levels of sets of target genes. Given their significance, numerous experiments have sought to characterize the specific target genes of specific regulators, which in turn has led to regulator target gene list databases. Unfortunately, these lists are plagued by poor curation and validation. Further, all lists suffer from the fundamental issue that regulator targets vary across tissue type and physiological state, or “context”, making them poor for conducting downstream, context-specific analyses. To address this issue, here we present a method called icTAIR that contextually-refines regulator target gene lists. To demonstrate its value, we use icTAIR to take the largest-available database of regulator target gene lists, refine it for the breast cancer context, and use both the pre-refined and refined lists for downstream survival analyses in over 3,400 tumors. We find that icTAIR improves the statistical power of the analyses by multiple orders of magnitude. This in turn lets us map the relational network of breast cancer regulators and identify regulators with prognostic effects even after clinicopathological adjustment. We anticipate icTAIR will be broadly useful in regulator studies.
