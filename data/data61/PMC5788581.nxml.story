Controversial findings have been reported regarding to the effect of the transporter associated with antigen processing 1 (TAP1) polymorphisms exerted on the atopic diseases susceptibility. To gain a better understanding of the effects of TAP1 polymorphisms on the risk of atopic diseases, a retrospective study was carried out to evaluate the association of the most common TAP1 polymorphisms, rs1057141 and rs1135216, with the risk of atopic diseases. From studies published in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science up to July 2017, ten eligible studies were selected for meta-analysis. The pooled results from rs1135216 polymorphism showed increased risk of atopic diseases in homozygote and recessive comparison. From the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, it was found that rs1135216 polymorphism contributed to atopic diseases susceptibility among Africans in all the five genetic models. Subgroup analysis by atopic types indicated significant association of TAP1 polymorphism rs1135216 with asthma in the allele, dominant and recessive models and with allergic rhinitis in the recessive model. As to rs1057141, increased risk of atopic disease in the allelic, dominant and heterozygous model was found in African population. Overall, this meta-analysis study demonstrated that rs1135216 polymorphism may contribute to atopic diseases susceptibility in Asians and Africans as assessed in this study. However, well designed large-scale case-control studies are needed to confirm such preliminary findings.
