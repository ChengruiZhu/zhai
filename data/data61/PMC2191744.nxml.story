The present work was designed to evaluate the effects of functional suppression of complement regulatory proteins in vivo. Male Wistar rats were anesthetized with Nembutal and were intravenously injected with 1 mg/kg of F(ab')2 or Fab fraction of either monoclonal antibody 5I2, which inhibits the function of rat counterpart of mouse Crry/p65, or monoclonal antibody 6D1, which inhibits the rat counterpart of CD59. Mean arterial pressure was continuously measured for 30 min. When 5I2 was injected, there was a biphasic change of mean arterial pressure, namely, the rapid increase immediately after the injection (approximately 2 min, phase 1) and the subsequent fall and slow recovery (approximately 4-30 min, phase 2). These effects were completely abrogated by pretreatment of rats with cobra venom factor. Pretreatment with carboxypeptidase inhibitor, which inhibits inactivation of anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, induced enhanced reduction of blood pressure. Circulating leukocytes and platelets were rapidly decreased 5 min after antibody injection and became normal by 2 h. Hematocrit and erythrocyte count were continuously increased up to 2 h after injection, suggesting that there was hemoconcentration due to increased vascular permeability. Immunofluorescence study revealed binding of antibody fragments and rat C3 along the capillaries of lung, heart, and liver 5 min after injection. In contrast to 5I2, F(ab')2 fraction of 6D1, though localized to the same areas and in similar amounts, had no significant effect on the parameters measured. These data suggest that the rat counterpart of mouse Crry/p65 plays a vital role in vivo by preventing the activation of autologous complement on vascular endothelium.
