Feature selection is of great importance in Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) analysis. This problem has been solved using some meta-heuristic algorithms such as GA, PSO, ACO and so on. In this work two novel hybrid meta-heuristic algorithms i.e. Sequential GA and LA (SGALA) and Mixed GA and LA (MGALA), which are based on Genetic algorithm and learning automata for QSAR feature selection are proposed. SGALA algorithm uses advantages of Genetic algorithm and Learning Automata sequentially and the MGALA algorithm uses advantages of Genetic Algorithm and Learning Automata simultaneously. We applied our proposed algorithms to select the minimum possible number of features from three different datasets and also we observed that the MGALA and SGALA algorithms had the best outcome independently and in average compared to other feature selection algorithms. Through comparison of our proposed algorithms, we deduced that the rate of convergence to optimal result in MGALA and SGALA algorithms were better than the rate of GA, ACO, PSO and LA algorithms. In the end, the results of GA, ACO, PSO, LA, SGALA, and MGALA algorithms were applied as the input of LS-SVR model and the results from LS-SVR models showed that the LS-SVR model had more predictive ability with the input from SGALA and MGALA algorithms than the input from all other mentioned algorithms. Therefore, the results have corroborated that not only is the predictive efficiency of proposed algorithms better, but their rate of convergence is also superior to the all other mentioned algorithms.
