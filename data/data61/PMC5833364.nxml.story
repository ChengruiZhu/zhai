Recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) is widely used in the clinic for bone defect reconstruction because of its powerful osteoinductive capacity. However, commercially available rhBMP-2 requires a high concentration in the clinical setting for consistent bone formation. A high dose of rhBMP-2 induces a promising bone formation yield but also leads to inflammation-related events, deteriorated bone quality, and fatty tissue formation. We hypothesize that the seemingly contradictory phenomenon of coformation of new bone and excessive adipose tissue in rhBMP-2-induced bone voids may be associated with interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is significantly elevated after application of rhBMP-2/absorbable collagen sponge (rhBMP-2/ACS). Here, we show that IL-6 injection enhances new bone regeneration and induces excessive adipose tissue formation in an rhBMP-2/ACS-induced ectopic bone formation model in rats. In vitro data further show that IL-6 and its soluble receptor sIL-6R synergistically augment rhBMP-2-induced osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of human BMSCs (hBMSCs) by promoting cell surface translocation of BMPR1A and then amplifying BMPR1A-mediated BMP/Smad and p38 MAPK pathways, respectively. Our study suggests elevated IL-6 may be responsible for coformation of new bone and excessive adipose tissue in rhBMP-2-induced bone voids.
