Overall, the search strategy yielded 433 results (425 MEDLINE, seven congress abstracts, one unpublished study); after excluding duplicate publications and case reports, 30 studies were identified (the earliest was published in 1993, the most recent in 2012); ten were controlled (six randomized controlled trials, four non-randomized controlled studies), and 20 uncontrolled trials (eight prospective observational studies, 12 retrospective case series). The cumulative literature describes the experiences of 860 patients with various forms of SE treated with intravenous VPA. The overall response rate to abrogate SE was 70.9 % (601/848; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 67.8–73.9). Response rates to intravenous VPA were better in children than in adults and did not differ between the SE types. The most commonly reported effective doses were between 15 and 45 mg/kg in bolus (6 mg/kg/min) followed by 1–3 mg/kg/h infusion. Safety studies of intravenous VPA administration in patients with SE showed a low incidence of adverse events overall (<10 %), mainly dizziness, thrombocytopenia, and mild hypotension, which was independent of infusion rates. Of note, good cardiovascular and respiratory tolerability was observed in these studies, even at high doses and fast infusion rates (up to 30 mg/kg at 10 mg/kg/min), despite multiple morbidities or other antiepileptic drugs. The most serious concern relates to the possibility of acute encephalopathy, sometimes related to hepatic abnormalities or hyperammonemia.
