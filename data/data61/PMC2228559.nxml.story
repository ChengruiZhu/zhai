A study has been made of the effects of calcium ions on the number of quanta secreted from all the release sites at an amphibian motor nerve terminal recorded with an intracellular microelectrode (m) compared with the number secreted simultaneously from a small number of release sites recorded with an extracellular microelectrode (me). If the endplate potential was made subthreshold by lowering the external calcium concentration ([Ca]o less than or equal to 0.4 mM), it was possible to find small groups of release sites for which me was comparable to m, indicating considerable nonuniformity in the probability of release of a quantum at different groups of release sites (Pe) in a given [Ca]o. Increasing [Ca]o in the range from 0.25 to 0.4 mM increased the probability of release of a quantum at groups of release sites (Pe), independent of the initial value of Pe, and the dependence of Pe on [Ca]o followed a fourth power relationship. A conditioning impulse enhanced the probability of release of a quantum by a subsequent test impulse at release sites, if Pe was less than 1.0 during the conditioning impulse. It is shown that the present observations regarding the dependence of Pe on [Ca]o and on conditioning impulses can be quantitatively predicted from previous observations regarding the dependence of the binomial parameters m, p, and n on [Ca]o and on conditioning impulses determined with intracellular electrodes, if the probability of secretion of a quantum at a release site (Pj) is different for different release sites and Pj is distributed as a beta random variable.
