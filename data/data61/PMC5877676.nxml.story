 = 6). The activities of hepatic CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2C, CYP2B, CYP3A and CYP4A, and the mRNA expression levels of hepatic and renal transporters, were determined. Compared to the NC group, the activities of CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP4A and CYP2C in DC group were increased by 2.36-, 2.10-, 2.55- and 1.86-fold, respectively. The mRNA expression levels of hepatic Oat2, Oatp2b1 and Oatp1a5, and renal Oct1, Octn2, Oatp2b1 and Oatp1a5, were significantly down-regulated, while the mRNA expression levels of hepatic Octn2, Oatp3a1, Oatp1a1 and Mdr2, and renal Oat2, Mrp4 and Bcrp, were significantly upregulated. Compared to the DC group, Hon treatment significantly inhibited the activity of hepatic CYP2E1, CYP4A, 3A and CYP1A2 by 45.6%, 29.2%, 22.7% and 20.7% in Hon high dose group, respectively. Moreover, Hon treatment significantly inhibited the mRNA expression levels of renal Bcrp and Mrp4 by 2.63-fold and 1.54-fold, while significantly upregulated the mRNA expression levels of hepatic Oat2 and Oatp2b1 by 1.52-fold and 1.54-fold in Hon high dose group, respectively. The results suggested that under the diabetes condition, the changes of CYP450 activity and transporter expression inevitably interfere the normal transport, metabolism and efficacy of drugs. The present work firstly reported that Hon treatment ameliorated the abnormal change of hepatic CYP activity (including CYP2E1, CYP4A and CYP1A2) and the transporter mRNA expression (including hepatic Oat2 and Oatp2b1, renal Bcrp and Mrp4) in type 2 diabetic rats induced by high-fat diet and strepotozotocin, which are associated with the occurrence and development of diabetes.
