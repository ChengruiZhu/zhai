bcl-2 is a member of the bcl-2 family that inhibits apoptosis, plays a crucial role in cell viability and is expressed in various types of tumors. With respect to inconsistent results in previous studies, the aim of the present study was to generate a clear hypothesis with regards to the value of bcl-2 expression as a predictive or prognostic factor in human osteosarcoma. The expression of bcl-2 was examined immunohistochemically in 49 patients with high-grade osteosarcoma and the results were correlated with localization, histological response to chemotherapy, survival and the occurrence of metastases. In patients with osteosarcoma, 21/49 cases (43%) were positive for bcl-2 expression and the remaining cases were negative. A significantly higher expression of bcl-2 was observed in central tumors located in the pelvis (83 vs. 37% positive; P<0.05). The bcl-2 expression status revealed no statistically significant correlation with response to chemotherapy, with 57% of patients with bcl-2-positive tumors showing a good response and 43% showing a poor response. No significant difference was observed when comparing survival or occurrence in bcl-2-positive and -negative tumors. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that, despite higher bcl-2 expression in central osteosarcoma, the expression in high-grade osteosarcoma is not a reliable prognostic or predictive marker.
