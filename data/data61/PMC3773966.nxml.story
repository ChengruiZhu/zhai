Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs) are lysosomal storage disorders caused by deficiency of enzymes involved in the degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). These disorders are associated with the accumulation of GAGs in tissues with organomegaly, mental retardation and short stature. Otologic and upper respiratory tract pathologies are among the earliest clinical manifestations. We analyzed 20 patients (13 male and 7 female, median age at the beginning of the observation 6 years) with MPS (35% type I, 30% type II, 20% type III, 5% type IV, 10% type VI), focusing on their otorhinolaryngologic problems and the impact of surgery on quality of life. We found ear, nose and throat manifestations in all types of MPS; in particular, recurrent otitis media was present in 30% of cases, hearing loss in 75% (mixed in 43.33%, conductive in 43.33%, sensorineural in 13.33%), adenotonsillar hypertrophy in 75%, frequent infections of the upper airway in 75% and obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome in 45% of cases. Fifty percent of patients required surgical therapy (adenotonsillectomy, adenoidectomy with insertion of middle ear ventilation tubes, tonsillectomy, tracheotomy and exeresis of vocal cord polyps). In our experience the ENT surgery reduced the frequency and severity of ear infections and relieved symptoms related to upper airway obstruction, thereby improving the quality of life in affected patients.
