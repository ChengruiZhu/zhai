, possesses large pectoral fin adductor muscles whose simultaneous contraction enables the fish to dart upwards at the approach of a predator. These muscles can be excited by either Mauthner fiber. In the medulla, each Mauthner fiber forms axo-axonic synapses on four "giant fibers," two on each side of the midline. Each pair of giant fibers innervates ipsilateral motoneurons controlling the pectoral fin adductor muscles. Mauthner fibers and giant fibers can be penetrated simultaneously by microelectrodes close to the synapses between them. Electrophysiological evidence indicates that transmission from Mauthner to giant fiber is chemically mediated. Under some conditions miniature postsynaptic potentials (PSP's) are observed, suggesting quantal release of transmitter. However, relatively high frequency stimulation reduces PSP amplitude below that of the miniature potentials, but causes no complete failures of PSP's. Thus quantum size is reduced or postsynaptic membrane is desensitized. Ramp currents in Mauthner fibers that rise too slowly to initiate spikes can evoke responses in giant fibers that appear to be asynchronous PSP's. Probably both spikes and ramp currents act on the same secretory mechanism. A single Mauthner fiber spike is followed by prolonged depression of transmission; also PSP amplitude is little affected by current pulses that markedly alter presynaptic spike height. These findings suggest that even a small spike releases most of an immediately available store of transmitter. If so, the probability of release by a single spike is high for any quantum of transmitter within this store.
