Interferons (IFNs) are important cytokines that protect the host from a broad spectrum of pathogens. IFN-λ, the most recently identified IFN, exhibits potent antiviral activity similar to IFN-α/β. In contrast to the ubiquitous presence of the IFN-α/β receptor, however, the expression of the IFN-λ receptor is restricted to epithelial cells and hepatocytes and absent from immune cells and brain cells. The molecular mechanism responsible for this tissue-specific IFN-λ receptor expression has been elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that histone acetylation mediates chromatin relaxation and transcriptional activation of IFN-λ receptor expression in a cell-type-specific manner. When IFN-λ nonresponsive cells—those that don't normally express the IFN-λ receptor—are treated with inhibitors that block histone deacetylase (HDAC) function, these cells express elevated levels of the IFN-λ receptor and gain sensitivity to IFN-λ. Importantly, rewiring the receptor expression program in this manner via use of HDAC inhibitors can protect formerly IFN-λ-insensitive cells, including primary human astrocytes, from both DNA and RNA virus infection. Additionally, treatment with HDAC inhibitors can also render previously nonresponsive cell types susceptible to the antitumor activity of IFN-λ, thereby inducing apoptosis in glioblastoma cells. This work suggests that a combination of small-molecule HDAC inhibitors and IFN-λ could be a potential antiviral and anticancer strategy.
