Bei-Bienko, is one of the most dominant and economically important grasshopper species in the steppe grasslands and farming-pastoral ecotone in northern China. It is a univoltine species and overwinters as eggs in soil. The cold hardiness of its eggs was examined in the laboratory. Water content in soil significantly affected the supercooling points (SCPs), water content and fat content of prediapause eggs. With the increase of water content in soil, the SCP, and water content of prediapause eggs rose whereas the fat content declined. There was a significant relationship between the SCP and water content or fat content of prediapause eggs. The SCPs of prediapause and diapause eggs varied from −7.6 to −28.4°C and the SCPs of eggs 30 d after oviposition could be divided into two groups. The means of high SCP group (−11.0 to −11.9°C) were much higher than those of low SCP group (−21.8 to −21.9°C), and the majority belonged to the latter (90.48–93.33%). The SCPs of prediapause eggs and early-diapause eggs 30 d after oviposition were significantly higher than those of deep-diapause eggs 60 d after oviposition. The survival rates of diapause eggs were significantly different among different temperature treatments. The survival rate was higher than 88% at greater than −20°C and declined significantly to 57% at −25°C, and suddenly dropped to zero at −30°C. The lower lethal temperature (Ltemp50) for 12 h exposure was −25.3°C and the lower lethal time (Ltime50) at −20°C was 32.8 d. As the mean SCPs of diapause eggs were similar to their Ltemp50, the SCP of eggs can be considered as a good indicator of cold hardiness for
