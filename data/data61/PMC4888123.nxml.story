MicroRNAs (miRs) are a class of small endogenous non-coding RNAs of ~21â€“24 nucleotides in length. Previous studies have indicated that miR-196b has either an oncogenic or tumor-suppressive function in various types of cancer. However, the biological role of miR-196b in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains unclear. In the present study, the expression levels of miR-196b were examined in oral cancer tissues and corresponding adjacent normal tissues from 69 OSCC patients using stem-loop reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results indicated that miR-196b was significantly overexpressed in OSCC tissues compared with the corresponding adjacent normal tissue samples (64 of 69, 92.7%, P<0.001). Analysis of the methylation status of the miR-196b gene indicated more frequent hypomethylation of the CpG islands located upstream of the miR-196b gene in the OSCC tissues than in the adjacent normal tissues (32 of 69, 46.3%), and the methylation status of miR-196b correlated inversely with its expression levels. Furthermore, the unmethylated status of the miR-196b promoter correlated with poor disease-specific survival in OSCC patients (P=0.035). Functional analysis revealed that ectopic miR-196b expression promoted oral cancer cell migration and invasion abilities, and that silencing of miR-196b could abrogate
