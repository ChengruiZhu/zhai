Recent clinical studies have revealed the treatment of diabetic patients with sodium glucose co-transporter2 (SGLT2) inhibitors to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events. Using nicotinamide and streptozotocin (NA/STZ) -treated ApoE KO mice, we investigated the effects of short-term (seven days) treatment with the SGLT2 inhibitor luseogliflozin on mRNA levels related to atherosclerosis in the aorta, as well as examining the long-term (six months) effects on atherosclerosis development. Eight-week-old ApoE KO mice were treated with NA/STZ to induce diabetes mellitus, and then divided into two groups, either untreated, or treated with luseogliflozin. Seven days after the initiation of luseogliflozin administration, atherosclerosis-related mRNA levels in the aorta were compared among four groups; i.e., wild type C57/BL6J, native ApoE KO, and NA/STZ-treated ApoE KO mice, with or without luseogliflozin. Short-term luseogliflozin treatment normalized the expression of inflammation-related genes such as F4/80, TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, ICAM-1, PECAM-1, MMP2 and MMP9 in the NA/STZ-treated ApoE KO mice, which showed marked elevations as compared with untreated ApoE KO mice. In contrast, lipid metabolism-related genes were generally unaffected by luseogliflozin treatment. Furthermore, after six-month treatment with luseogliflozin, in contrast to the severe and widely distributed atherosclerotic changes in the aortas of NA/STZ-treated ApoE KO mice, luseogliflozin treatment markedly attenuated the progression of atherosclerosis, without affecting serum lipid parameters such as high density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels. Given that luseogliflozin normalized the aortic mRNA levels of inflammation-related, but not lipid-related, genes soon after the initiation of treatment, it is not unreasonable to speculate that the anti-atherosclerotic effect of this SGLT2 inhibitor emerges rapidly, possibly via the prevention of inflammation rather than of hyperlipidemia.
