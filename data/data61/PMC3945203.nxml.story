Organisms are complex biological systems that must continue to function even as their genomes evolve. While evolution is usually gradual, the formation of new species by the hybridization of different parents—allopolyploidization—occurs nearly instantaneously. A key question is what happens to expression of the two parental gene copies following genome merger. To determine this, we focused on a fungal allopolyploid from a group that dominates many of the world's pastoral economies. To investigate the fate of gene expression in this system, we developed a novel pipeline to assign high throughput RNA sequence reads to the two parental gene copies, thus allowing quantification of expression. We found transcriptional responses to be predominantly conservative: most gene copies either inherit parental expression patterns, or if differentially expressed in the parents, that difference is lost in the hybrid. Moreover, we identified an extraordinary level of concordance in the fate of genome-wide allopolyploid gene expression with that seen in cotton. The very different nature of these two allopolyploids suggests that there is a set of universal rules for the transcriptional response to genome merger. We propose a mechanistic model whereby this conserved response reflects similarities in mutational processes that underlie gene regulatory evolution.
