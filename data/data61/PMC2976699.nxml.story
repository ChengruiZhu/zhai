We combined data for adult participants in three cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2001–2, 2003–4, 2005–6), a representative sample of the civilian, non-institutionalized US population (N = 3,958). Using this data we examined joint associations of 25(OH)D, PTH and calcium with a range of cardiovascular risk factors. 25(OH)D was inversely associated with fasting insulin (mean difference in insulin per 1 standard deviation 25(OH)D: −0.053 (95%CI: −0.091, −0.015)), glucose (−0.046 95%CI: −0.081, −0.012) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) (−0.032 95%CI: −0.062, −0.001), and positively associated with high density lipoprotein cholesterol HDL-c (0.088 95%CI: 0.044, 0.148), after adjustment for ethnicity, smoking, socio-economic status and waist circumference. PTH was positively associated with diastolic blood pressure (0.110, 95%CI: 0.055, 0.164) in confounder adjusted models, but was not associated with other cardiovascular risk factors. Albumin adjusted calcium was associated with triglycerides (0.102 95%CI: 0.063, 0.141), postload glucose (0.078, 95%CI: 0.025, 0.130), fasting insulin (0.074, 95%CI: 0.044, 0.104), HbA1c (0.070, 95%CI: 0.036, 0.105), SBP (0.064, 95%CI: 0.028, 0.100), fasting glucose (0.055, 95%CI: 0.018, 0.092) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.052, 95%CI: 0.014, 0.091). With mutual adjustment for each other, these associations remained essentially unchanged.
