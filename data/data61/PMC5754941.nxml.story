The article throws light on the process of importing a novel preclinical drug into India based on the real-life experience from one of our studies. A novel drug “X” acting through a new mechanism of action was hypothesized by us to function as a neuroprotectant. It was decided to import this novel drug from a university located in Brazil. An official collaboration pact was exchanged between both the sides. In accordance with the Indian Drug and Cosmetics Act 1940, unauthorized import of drug into India is not permitted. Hence, we decided to apply for the import license from Government of India. During the process of registration, we realized that the CDSCO SUGAM portal did not have facilities for the application from academic institute. We further faced challenges in different steps of import such as registration of the institute, individual drug application, fee transaction through the bank for Form 12, and customs duty clearance in the New Delhi airport. The process of import of drug for the purpose of testing by academic institutes has not been regularized by the CDSCO, and we suggest the apex organization to make separate provision for the academic institutes. This will encourage more academic institutes in India to opt for global collaborative works. This narration will further help them in following the same footsteps without facing significant hurdles. If more research on novel chemical entities is carried out in various academic institutes of India, it would not be far that we discover a blockbuster drug making the whole world turn toward us.
