E-cadherin is a cell surface adhesion molecules that play an important role in tissue differentiation. FGFR1 is expressed in the developing and mature skeleton in patterns suggestive of both unique and redundant function. Expression levels of E-cadherin and FGFR1 during osteoblastogenesis unclear. In this study primary calvarial mouse osteoblasts were differentiated to mature osteoblasts in osteogenic medium. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, alizarin red staining, gene expression (Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), collagen 1 (COL1A2), osteocalcin, E-cadherin and FGFR1) and protein expression (E-cadherin and FGFR1) of osteogenic-cultured primary mouse osteoblast were analysed in this study. The osteogenesis capacity of primary osteoblasts was significantly promoted as ALP activity, alizarin red staining, and the relative expression of Runx2 mRNA and COL1A2 mRNA significantly increased during osteoblastogenesis. The results demonstrated that E-cadherin mRNA and protein were expressed in immature osteoblasts (day 7), but not in mature osteoblasts (day 28). In contrast, the expression of FGFR1 mRNA and protein significantly highly expressed in mature osteoblasts (day 28) compared with immature osteoblasts (day 7). In conclusion, this study demonstrated that E-cadherin could be used as a marker for immature osteoblasts, whereas FGFR1 could be used as a marker for mature osteoblasts during
