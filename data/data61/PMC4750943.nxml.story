We here present how to parameterize a mathematical agent-based model of growing MCTS almost completely from experimental data. MCTS show a similar establishment of pathophysiological gradients and concentric arrangement of heterogeneous cell populations as found in avascular tumor nodules. We build a process chain of imaging, image processing and analysis, and mathematical modeling. In this model, each individual cell is represented by an agent populating one site of a three dimensional un-structured lattice. The spatio-temporal multi-cellular behavior, including migration, growth, division, death of each cell, is considered by a stochastic process, simulated numerically by the Gillespie algorithm. Processes on the molecular scale are described by deterministic partial differential equations for molecular concentrations, coupled to intracellular and cellular decision processes. The parameters of the multi-scale model are inferred from comparisons to the growth kinetics and from image analysis of spheroid cryosections stained for cell death, proliferation and collagen IV. Our final model assumes ATP to be the critical resource that cells try to keep constant over a wide range of oxygen and glucose medium concentrations, by switching between aerobic and anaerobic metabolism. Besides ATP, lactate is shown to be a possible explanation for the control of the necrotic core size. Direct confrontation of the model simulation results with image data on the spatial profiles of cell proliferation, ECM distribution and cell death, indicates that in addition, the effects of ECM and waste factors have to be added to explain the data. Hence the model is a tool to identify likely mechanisms at work that may subsequently be studied experimentally, proposing a model-guided experimental strategy.
