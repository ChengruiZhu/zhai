Human rhinovirus (HRV) infection is a major cause of asthma exacerbations, which appears to be linked to a defective innate immune response to infection. Although the type I interferons (IFN-α and IFN-β) have a critical role in protecting against most viral infections, the cells responsible for IFN production in response to HRV and the relative importance of pattern recognition receptors located in endosomes has not been fully elucidated. In the current study we demonstrate that, using intracellular flow cytometry, >90% of the IFN-α-producing cells in human blood mononuclear cells following HRV16 exposure are plasmacytoid dendritic cells, whereas monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells contribute only 10% and <1%, respectively, of the IFN-α production. Bafilomycin and chloroquine, agents that inhibit the function of endosomal toll-like receptors (TLRs), significantly reduced the capacity of TLR3-, TLR7- and TLR-9-stimulated cells to produce IFN-α and the IFN-induced chemokine CXCL10 (IP-10). In contrast, only bafilomycin (but not chloroquine) effectively suppressed HRV16-stimulated IFN-α and IP-10 production, whereas neither bafilomycin or chloroquine inhibited HRV16-stimulated interleukin-6 release. Attempts to block IFN-α production with commercially available TLR-specific oligonucleotides were unsuccessful due to major ‘off-target' effects. These findings suggest that among circulating haemopoietic cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells and TLRs located within endosomes are critical for inducing efficient IFN-I production in response to HRVs.
