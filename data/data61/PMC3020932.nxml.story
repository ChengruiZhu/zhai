How are genes transcribed at the right levels and under the right conditions? Transcription regulation in eukaryotes has long been proposed to work by a division of labor: ubiquitous DNA sequence features in the core promoter region, close to the transcription start site (TSS) of genes, were thought to generically encode information to recruit RNA polymerase to initiate transcription, while specific sequence features, often distal from the genes, were thought to boost expression under the right conditions. Supporting the generic function of core promoters, genome-wide chromatin maps showed a stereotypical arrangement of well-spaced nucleosomes providing access to the TSS. High-throughput sequencing has generated genome-wide TSS maps at high resolution, which show that promoters exhibit different initiation patterns, ranging from focused start sites to dispersed regions. Linking these patterns to chromatin maps, we now find distinct core promoter classes, those in which the TSS location is defined broadly on the chromatin level and those in which the TSS is defined by precisely positioned sequence features. Notably, these architectures are conserved deeply across eukaryotes and are used for different functional classes of genes. Our work adds to the increasing understanding that core promoters contribute significantly to the complexity of eukaryotic gene expression.
