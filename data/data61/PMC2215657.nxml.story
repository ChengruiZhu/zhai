Membrane current following prolonged periods of rapid stimulation was examined in short (less than 1.5 mm) canine cardiac Purkinje fibers of radius less than 0.15 mm. The Purkinje fibers were repetitively stimulated by delivering trains of depolarizing voltage clamp pulses at rapid frequencies. The slowly decaying outward current following repetitive stimulation ("post-drive" current) is eliminated by the addition of 10(-5) M dihydro-ouabain. The post-drive current is attributed to enhanced Na/K exchange caused by Na loading during the overdrive. Depolarizing voltage clamp pulses initiated from negative (- 80 mV) or depolarized (-50 mV) holding potentials can give rise to post- drive current because of activation of tetrodotoxin-sensitive or D600- sensitive channels. The magnitude of the post-drive current depends on the frequency of voltage clamp pulses, the duration of each pulse, and the duration of the repetitive stimulation. The time constant of decay of the post-drive current depends on extracellular [K] in accordance with Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The Km is 1.2 mM bulk [K], [K]B. The mean time constant in 4 mM [K]B is 83 s. Epinephrine (10(-5) M) decreases the time constant by 20%. The time constant is increased by lowering [Ca]o between 4 and 1 mM. Lowering [Ca]o further, to 0.1 mM, eliminates post-drive current following repetitive stimulation initiated from depolarized potentials. The latter result suggests that slow inward Ca2+ current may increase [Na]i via Na/Ca exchange.
