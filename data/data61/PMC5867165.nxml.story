It proved that Zymosan‐A protected the haematopoietic system from radiation‐induced damage via Toll‐Like Receptor2 in our previous study. In this study, we investigated the potential mechanism for the radioprotective effects of Zymosan‐A. The mice were treated with Zymosan‐A (50 mg/kg, dissolved in NS) via peritoneal injection 24 and 2 hours before ionizing radiation. Apoptosis of bone marrow cells and the levels of IL‐6, IL‐12, G‐CSF and GM‐CSF were evaluated by flow cytometry assay. DNA damage was determined by γ‐H2AX foci assay. In addition, RNA sequencing was performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Zymosan‐A protected bone marrow cells from radiation‐induced apoptosis, up‐regulated IL‐6, IL‐12, G‐CSF and GM‐CSF in bone marrow cells. Zymosan‐A also protected cells from radiation‐induced DNA damage. Moreover, RNA sequencing analysis revealed that Zymosan‐A induced 131 DEGs involved in the regulation of immune system process and inflammatory response. The DEGs were mainly clustered in 18 KEGG pathways which were also associated with immune system processes. Zymosan‐A protected bone marrow cells from radiation‐induced apoptosis and up‐regulated IL‐6, IL‐12, G‐CSF and GM‐CSF. Moreover, Zymosan‐A might also exhibit radioprotective effects through regulating immune system process and inflammatory response. These results provided new knowledge regarding the radioprotective effect of Zymosan‐A.
