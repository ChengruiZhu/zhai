When we look at a visual scene, neurons in our eyes “fire” short, electrical pulses in a pattern that encodes information about the visual world. This pattern passes through a series of processing stages within the brain, eventually leading to cells whose firing encodes high-level aspects of the scene, such as the identity of a visible object regardless of its position, apparent size or angle. Remarkably, features of these firing patterns, at least at the earlier stages of the pathway, can be predicted by building “efficient” codes for natural images: that is, codes based on models of the statistical properties of the environment. In this study, we have taken a first step towards extending this theoretical success to describe later stages of processing, building a model that extracts a structured representation in much the same way as does the visual system. The model describes discrete, persistent visual elements, whose appearance varies over time—a simplified version of a world built of objects that move and rotate. We show that when fit to natural image sequences, features of the “code” implied by this model match many aspects of processing in the first cortical stage of the visual system, including: the individual firing patterns of types of cells known as “simple” and “complex”; the distribution of coding properties over these cells; and even how these properties depend on the cells' physical proximity. The model thus brings us closer to understanding the functional principles behind the organisation of the visual system.
