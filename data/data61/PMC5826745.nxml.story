 April 2017 in English language. Two researchers individually searched and screened all the relevant articles and separately extracted data using a data extraction table created in Microsoft Excel. Another researcher cross-checked the whole process to maintain consistency. Any sort of disagreement was resolved by group consensus. Thematic analysis was performed for data analysis. According to the included studies, the prevalence of underweight and stunting dramatically reduced among Bangladeshi women in last 10 years, though, nearly one-fourth of women are underweight and one-fifth of women are stunted in Bangladesh. Additionally, nearly half of the country’s women are suffering from different micronutrient deficiencies. This immense burden of undernutrition is accompanied by the presence of overweight or obesity among nearly half of the adult women. Women’s age, area of residence, education and wealth index have a significant influence on determining their nutritional status. DBM is an inevitable reality among Bangladesh women. The adverse health consequences of women’s undernutrition and overnutrition have been well documented. As women’s nutritional status is a multifaceted issue, effective implementation of very specific and focused public health interventions with inclusive multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder approaches are indispensable to combat this problem.
