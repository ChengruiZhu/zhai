-diamminedichloridoplatinum(II) (CDDP), commonly referred to as cisplatin, is a chemotherapeutic drug used for the treatment of a wide range of solid cancers. CDDP is a relatively poor inducer of immunogenic cell death (ICD), a cell death modality that converts dying cells into a tumor vaccine, stimulating an immune response against residual cancer cells that permits long-lasting immunity and a corresponding reduction in tumor growth. The incapacity of CDDP to trigger ICD is at least partially due to its failure to stimulate the premortem endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress response required for the externalization of the “eat-me” signal calreticulin (CRT) on the surface of dying cancer cells. Here, we developed a murine cancer cell line genetically modified to express the ER resident protein reticulon-1c (Rtn-1c) by virtue of tetracycline induction and showed that enforced Rtn-1c expression combined with CDDP treatment promoted CRT externalization to the surface of cancer cells. In contrast to single agent treatments, the tetracycline-mediated Rtn-1c induction combined with CDDP chemotherapy stimulated ICD as measured by the capacity of dying tumor cells, inoculated into syngenic immunocompetent mice, to mount an immune response to tumor re-challenge 1 week later. More importantly, established tumors, forced to constitutively express Rtn-1c in vivo by continuous treatment with tetracycline, became responsive to CDDP and exhibited a corresponding reduction in the rate of tumor growth. The combined therapeutic effects of Rtn-1c induction with CDDP treatment was only detected in the context of an intact immune system and not in
