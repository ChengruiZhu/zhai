Complex network theory has provided new tools for studying the structure and function of complex systems. A particularly attractive avenue in this context is the analysis of biological systems, since structural principles of complex networks have been identified at all scales of functioning of living organisms. In the present paper, we propose a construction of a complex network representation of pancreatic islets of Langerhans. In this microorgan, interconnected beta cells produce and secrete insulin, an anabolic hormone that controls the level of nutrients in the blood. We determine the functional connectivity on the basis of patterns of correlations between experimentally measured calcium dynamics in individual beta cells. The extracted pattern of pairwise interactions between network elements, i.e. beta cells, is then scrutinized with conventional tools for network analysis. Our findings are largely reconcilable with known structural and functional properties but also point to the presence of unexpected small-world attributes that appear to represent a general organizational principle of the functional connectivity between beta cells. We argue that complex network analysis applied to islets of Langerhans is a valuable new tool in the physiologist's analytical repertoire, and in the future it could help deepen our understanding of their physiology.
