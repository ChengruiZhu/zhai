The conventional, low flux (LF) dialyzer allows the removal of small molecular solutes like urea and creatinine. High flux (HF) dialyzers allow the effective removal of middle molecules (MM) as well, and are associated with reduced hemodialysis-related morbidity and mortality. Cystatin C has attractive characteristics as a representative MM. The aim of this study was to determine cystatin C reduction ratio (CysCRR) in both LF and HF groups and to compare it with other markers of dialysis adequacy. Thirty-seven patients were subjected to both LF and HF hemodialysis 2 weeks apart. Serum urea, creatinine and cystatin C were measured pre- and post-dialysis. Cystatin C was measured by latex-enhanced immunoturbidimetry. Urea and creatinine reduction ratios were 72.3 ± 14.7% and 62.5 ± 13%, respectively in the LF group. The CysCRR was −9.7 ± 6.7% and 29.2 ± 11% in LF and HF hemodialysis, respectively. The statistically significant decrease in CysCRR in the HF group shows the effective clearance of MM by HF dialyzers. Hence, CysCRR could be applied to measure the MM clearance in HF hemodialysis. This study highlights the significance of cystatin C as an important dialysis adequacy marker replacing the conventional markers such as urea and creatinine in HF hemodialysis. Among the middle molecules cystatin C scores over beta-2 microglobulin.
