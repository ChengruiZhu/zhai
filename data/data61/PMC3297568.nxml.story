The pathophysiology of sepsis is complex and our mechanistic understanding remains incomplete. Mathematical models of the inflammatory response have been providing intellectual frameworks to reason about the complexity of sepsis. Due to an incompletely understood system along with very limited data, our approach focuses on building simplified, falsifiable and predictive models, and offers a means to quantify parametric uncertainty. Based on the construct that deterministic ensemble models exhibit population-like behavior, we developed a population-based computational framework that incorporates dysregulated neutrophil hyperactivity as a cellular dysfunction in septic processes. We hypothesize that probability distributions of physiological parameters conditional on population observations can characterize the range of possible physiologic responses in a population. Comparing the parameter ensembles from different phenotypes reveals some factors that play an important role in the expression of such phenotypes, such as sepsis survival. This framework can serve as an effective tool to gain insight into the pathophysiology of severe sepsis and generate testable hypotheses that guide future experiments. Our approach holds promise as a tool for integrating domain knowledge and experimental data into a quantitative assessment of population dynamics.
