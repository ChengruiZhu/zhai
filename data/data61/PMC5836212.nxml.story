Synchronous primary cancers involving the pancreas and kidney are extremely rare and poorly documented. We report the first case of this association treated with chemotherapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitor. A 70-year-old woman presented with a 2-month history of epigastric pain with weight loss of 12 kg. Two weeks previously, she had presented with jaundice and pelvic pain. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the body revealed the presence of an irregular mass in the body of the pancreas, encasing the celiac trunk, with dilatation of the biliary tract. CT also revealed a heterogeneously right renal mass with bone metastasis in the left acetabular cup and the left iliac wing. A biliary metallic prosthesis was performed with a pancreatic mass biopsy. Histology revealed a moderately differentiated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Another biopsy was performed in the right iliac wing. Pathological examination with immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis of bone metastasis from clear cell renal cell carcinoma. The patient was treated with a combination of gemcitabine, sunitinib, and denosumab. She had a stabilization disease and a prolonged progression-free survival of 9 months. Side effects were manageable and included grade 2 fatigue and grade 2 hypertension. The patient died at 13 months from diagnosis after disease progression. This report suggests that the appropriate treatment for this association in metastatic or unresectable disease is chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer and tyrosine kinase inhibitor for kidney cancer. We also review the appropriate literature concerning that association.
