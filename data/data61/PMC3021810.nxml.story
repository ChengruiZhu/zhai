 were systematically searched via MEDLINE/PubMed, and articles published in English related to the nervous system were selected and analyzed. The past two decades have provided interesting insights into the molecular mechanisms of this neuroprotective phenomenon. Although both rapid and delayed types of tolerance have been documented in experimental settings, the delayed type has been found to be more prominent in the case of neuronal ischemic tolerance. Many intracellular signaling pathways have been implicated regarding ischemic preconditioning. Most of these are associated with membrane receptors, kinase cascades, and transcription factors. Moreover, ischemic tolerance can be induced by exposing animals or cells to diverse types of endogenous and exogenous stimuli that are not necessarily hypoxic or ischemic in nature. These cross-tolerances raise the hope that, in the future, it will be possible to pharmacologically activate or mimic ischemic tolerance in the human brain. Another promising approach is remote preconditioning in which preconditioning of one organ or system leads to the protection of a different (remote) organ that is difficult to target, such as the brain. The preconditioning strategy and related interventions can confer neuroprotection in experimental ischemia, and, thus, have promise for practical applications in cases of vascular neurosurgery and endo-vascular therapy.
