Molecular mechanisms of Parkinson's disease (PD) have already been investigated in various different omics landscapes. We reviewed the literature about different omics approaches between November 2005 and November 2017 to depict the main pathological pathways for PD development. In total, 107 articles exploring different layers of omics data associated with PD were retrieved. The studies were grouped into 13 omics layers: genomicsâ€“DNA level, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, ncRNomics, interactomics, metabolomics, glycomics, lipidomics, phenomics, environmental omics, pharmacogenomics, and integromics. We discussed characteristics of studies from different landscapes, such as main findings, number of participants, sample type, methodology, and outcome. We also performed curation and preliminary synthesis of multiple omics data, and identified overlapping results, which could lead toward selection of biomarkers for further validation of PD risk loci. Biomarkers could support the development of targeted prognostic/diagnostic panels as a tool for early diagnosis and prediction of progression rate and prognosis. This review presents an example of a comprehensive approach to revealing the underlying processes and risk factors of a complex disease. It urges scientists to structure the already known data and integrate it into a meaningful context.
