It has been reported that neuronal activation results in a decrease of water diffusion in activated neural tissue. This new approach, known as diffusion functional MRI (DfMRI), has high potential for functional imaging of the brain, as the currently widespread blood oxygenation level—dependent (BOLD)-functional MRI (fMRI) method, which is based on neurovascular coupling, remains an indirect marker of neuronal activation. Here, we show that the water apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) derived from DfMRI increased in specific rat brain regions under anesthetic conditions, reflecting the decreased neuronal activity, especially in regions involved in wakefulness. Electrical stimulation of the central medial (CM) thalamic nucleus exhibiting this anesthesia-induced ADC increase led the animals to transiently wake up. Infusion of the CM with furosemide—a specific blocker of neuronal swelling—led the ADC to increase further locally and increased the current threshold for waking the animals. Conversely, induction of cell swelling in the CM through infusion of a hypotonic solution led to a local ADC decrease and a lower current threshold to wake the animals. Strikingly, the local ADC changes produced by blocking or enhancing cell swelling in the CM were also mirrored remotely in areas functionally connected to the CM, such as the cingulate and somatosensory cortex. Those results strongly suggest that neuronal swelling is a significant mechanism underlying DfMRI.
