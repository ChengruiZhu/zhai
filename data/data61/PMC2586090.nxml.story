Adaptive evolution is a central biological process that underlies diverse phenomena from the acquisition of antibiotic resistance by microbes to the evolution of niche specialization. Two unresolved questions regarding adaptive evolution are what types of genomic variation are associated with adaptation and how repeatable is the process. We evolved yeast populations for more than 200 generations in nutrient-limited chemostats. We find that the phenotype of adapted individuals, as measured using global gene expression, is much less variable in clones adapted to sulfate limitation than either glucose or phosphate limitation. We comprehensively analyzed the genomes of adapted clones and found that those adapted to sulfate limitation almost invariably carry amplifications of the gene encoding a sulfur transporter, but the mutations in individuals adapted to glucose and phosphate limitation are much more diverse. This parallelism holds true at the level of single-nucleotide mutations. Although there may be other paths to adapt to sulfate limitation, one path confers a much greater advantage than all others so it dominates. By contrast, there are a number of ways to adapt to glucose and phosphate limitation that confer similar advantages. We conclude that the reproducibility of evolution depends on the specific selective pressure experienced by the organism.
