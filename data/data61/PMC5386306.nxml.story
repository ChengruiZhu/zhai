RASopathies are genetic disorders often accompanied by a developmental delay and intellectual disabilities. However, the molecular mechanisms causing cognitive impairments are yet unclear. RASopathies are linked to mutations in components of the Ras/MAPK pathway. This pathway enables cells to adjust the expression of their genes in response to various environmental stimuli. In the brain, neurodevelopmental signals and neuronal activity are the main modulators of Ras/MAPK signaling, which regulates the expression of neuronal genes. This process is of key importance for normal cognition, learning and memory formation. In this study, we show that neurons expressing a RASopathy-related mutation fail to modulate their gene expression in response to neuronal activity. Paradoxically, despite of an increased basal Ras/MAPK signaling the induction of gene expression by neuronal activity is largely attenuated suggesting the emergence of compensatory mechanisms that dampen the unconstrained signaling. We propose that these mechanisms interfere with a normal induction of Ras/MAPK signaling and subsequent gene expression by neuronal activity. These findings have a therapeutic relevance, as they suggest that possible treatment strategies should focus on the restoration of the physiological dynamics of neuronal Ras/MAPK signaling rather than on a general dampening of this cascade.
