Two-dimensional (2D) strain analysis is constrained by geometry-dependent reference directions of deformation (i.e. radial, circumferential, and longitudinal) following the assumption of cylindrical chamber architecture. Three-dimensional (3D) principal strain analysis may overcome such limitations by referencing intrinsic (i.e. principal) directions of deformation. This study aimed to demonstrate clinical feasibility of 3D principal strain analysis from routine 2D cine MRI with validation to strain from 2D tagged cine analysis and 3D speckle tracking echocardiography. Thirty-one patients undergoing cardiac MRI were studied. 3D strain was measured from routine, multi-planar 2D cine SSFP images using custom software designed to apply 4D deformation fields to 3D cardiac models to derive principal strain. Comparisons of strain estimates versus those by 2D tagged cine, 2D non-tagged cine (feature tracking), and 3D speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) were performed. Mean age was 51 ± 14 (36% female). Mean LV ejection fraction was 66 ± 10% (range 37–80%). 3D principal strain analysis was feasible in all subjects and showed high inter- and intra-observer reproducibility (ICC range 0.83–0.97 and 0.83–0.98, respectively—p < 0.001 for all directions). Strong correlations of minimum and maximum principal strain were respectively observed versus the following: 3D STE estimates of longitudinal (r = 0.81 and r = −0.64), circumferential (r = 0.76 and r = −0.58) and radial (r = −0.80 and r = 0.63) strain (p < 0.001 for all); 2D tagged cine estimates of longitudinal (r = 0.81 and r = −0.81), circumferential (r = 0.87 and r = −0.85), and radial (r = −0.76 and r = 0.81) strain (p < 0.0001 for all); and 2D cine (feature tracking) estimates of longitudinal (r = 0.85 and −0.83), circumferential (r = 0.88 and r = −0.87), and radial strain (r = −0.79 and r = 0.84, p < 0.0001 for all). 3D principal strain analysis is feasible using routine, multi-planar 2D cine MRI and shows high reproducibility with strong correlations to 2D conventional strain analysis and 3D STE-based analysis. Given its independence from geometry-related directions of deformation this technique may offer unique benefit for the detection and prognostication of myocardial disease, and warrants expanded investigation.
