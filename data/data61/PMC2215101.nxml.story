Determinants of 45Ca influx, 45Ca efflux, and 22Na efflux were examined in dog red blood cells. 45Ca influx is strongly influenced by the Na concentration on either side of the membrane, being stimulated by intracellular Na and inhibited by extracellular Na. A saturation curve is obtained when Ca influx is plotted as a function of medium Ca concentration. The maximum Ca influx is a function of pH (increasing with greater alkalinity) and cell volume (increasing with cell swelling). Quinidine strongly inhibits Ca influx. Efflux of 45Ca is stimulated by increasing concentrations of extracellular Na. 22Na efflux is stimulated by either Ca or Na in the medium, and the effects of the two ions are mutually exclusive rather than additive. Quinidine inhibits Ca-activated 22Na efflux. The results are considered in terms of a model for Ca-Na exchange, and it is concluded that the system shows many features of such a coupled ion transport system. However, the stoichiometric ratio between Ca influx and Ca-dependent Na efflux is highly variable under different experimental conditions. Because the Ca fluxes may reflect a combination of ATP-dependent, outward transport and Na-linked passive movements, the true stoichiometry of an exchanger may not be ascertainable in the absence of a specific Ca pump inhibitor. The meaning of these observations for Ca-dependent volume regulation by dog red blood cells is discussed.
