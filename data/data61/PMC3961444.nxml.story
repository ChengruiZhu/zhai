The clinicopathological characteristics of squamous cell/adenosquamous carcinoma (SC/ASC) are currently not well documented, and as the prevalence of SC/ASC is uncommon in gallbladder cancers, a prognostic marker has not yet been found. In the present study, the expression of tumor susceptibility gene (TSG) 101 and paternally expressed gene (PEG) 10 was assessed in 46 SC/ASCs and 80 adenocarcinomas (ACs) using immunohistochemistry, and the samples were further analyzed to examine correlations with the clinicopathological characteristics. It was demonstrated that positive TSG101 and PEG10 expression were significantly associated with large tumor size, high tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, lymph node metastasis, invasion and no resection (only biopsy) of SC/ASC and AC. The univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that positive TSG101 and PEG10 expression, and differentiation, tumor size, TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, invasion and surgical curability, is closely associated with a decreased overall survival in SC/ASC and AC patients (P<0.05 or P<0.001). The multivariate Cox regression analysis identified that positive TSG101 and PEG10 expression are independent factors for a poor-prognosis in SC/ASC and AC patients. The present study indicates that positive TSG101 and PEG10 expression are closely associated with the clinical, pathological and biological behaviors, and a poor prognosis in gallbladder cancer.
