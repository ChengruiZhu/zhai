We present a case report on the successful healing of a Pseudomonas infection wound in a 52-year-old female with morbid obesity, noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus and a history of tobacco use, who presented with Stage IIIA (T3, N2, Mo) infiltrating ductal carcinoma. The patient received neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to her bilateral skin-sparing total mastectomies with right axillary sentinel lymphadenectomy. She also had staged reconstruction with temporary breast implants and plans for deep inferior epigastric perforator flaps. Two months after chest wall and regional nodal radiation therapy, she developed a marked soft tissue reaction to radiation. She underwent over 10 right chest wall open wound radical debridements resulting in a tissue defect of 25 cm in length, by 20 cm in width, by 10 cm in depth. Despite surgical debridement, intravenous antibiotics, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, colistin spray therapy, and heat lamp therapy, the infection failed to resolve and the wound failed to heal. She was left with an open wound that was extremely painful and required chronic pain management with opioids. The patient later was found to have developed a multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas infection in her wound. However, the experimental placement of a porcine bladder matrix (ACell©, Inc., Columbia, MD) on the wound resulted in the complete relief of pain just three days after the application of the product. After two weekly applications of ACell©, her infection completely resolved and she was beginning to grow islands of new epidermis over her non-healing mastectomy wound.
