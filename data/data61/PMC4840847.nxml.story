Ovarian cancer is a clinical type of gynecological malignant tumor with poor prognosis and a high mortality rate. At present, the primary treatment method used is surgery, with chemotherapy as an ajdunctive therapy. Thus, new short-term treatments should be identified. The aim of the present study was to investigate the short-term curative effects and safety of docetaxel combined with intraperitoneal cisplatin chemotherapy and hyperthermia treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. A total of 112 cases of advanced (stage IIIâ€“IV) ovarian cancer patients confirmed by clinical diagnosis between October 2014 and December 2015 were included in the study. The patients were randomly divided into the study and control groups (n=56 cases). The control group was treated with docetaxel and intraperitoneal cisplatin hyperthermic perfusion chemotherapy, while the study group was treated with docetaxel venous chemotherapy and intraperitoneal cisplatin cyclical hyperthermic perfusion chemotherapy with BR-TRG-1 body cavity hyperthermic perfusion treatment system. Clinical treatment results for short-term curative effects and adverse reactions were compared and analyzed 8 weeks after treatment. The total effective rate of the study and control groups were 87.5 and 62.5%, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). The controlled rate of ascites, remission rate of tumor and descent rate of CA125 of patients in the study group were better than patients in the control group (P<0.05). The rate of adverse reactions of patients in the study group was 39.3%, and the grade of toxicity was from I to II, while the rate of adverse reactions of patients in the control group was 55.4%, and the grade of toxicity was from II to III. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P<0.05). In conclusion, applying the combination of docetaxel, intraperitoneal cisplatin hyperthermic perfusion chemotherapy and hyperthermia to treat advanced ovarian cancer can improve the curative effects with little toxicity; thus, it is worthy of promotion and application.
