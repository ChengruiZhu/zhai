Pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) possess highly proliferative and angiogenic capacities and are localized at the critical interface between the blood and microvessel wall; they are the primary targets of inflammatory cytokines during lung inflammation. Angiopoietin-like protein 4 (Angptl4) is a circulating protein that has recently been implicated in the regulation of angiogenesis and metastasis. This study aimed to investigate the effect of Angptl4 on rat PMVECs (RPMVECs) exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The cell culture was stimulated with LPS. Total Angptl4 cDNA was obtained from Source BioScience. The PCR product was cloned into the pcDNA3.1-eGFP or the pcDNA3.1-eGFP-Angptl4 vector, which were then transfected into the RPMVECs using SuperFect transfection reagent. The Angptl4 mRNA levels, protein levels and cell morphology of the RPMVECs in the experimental groups were detected using real time-PCR, western blot analysis, MTT assay, ELISA and confocal microscopy methods, respectively. The Angptl4 expression vector, pcDNA3.1-eGFP-Angptl4, was successfully constructed. The Angptl4 mRNA level in the LPS-pcDNA3.1-eGFP-transfected group (blank control) was slightly increased and was significantly higher in the experimental group compared with the empty vector and blank control group with significant differences. Pro-apoptotic caspase-8, -9 and Bax protein were inhibited, while p-AKT/AKT and p-MEK1/2 protein expression was also decreased. The rosiglitazone group had significantly decreased levels of the inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± (P<0.01). The overexpression of Angptl4 inhibited the LPS-induced increase in the permeability of the RPMVECs, which was associated with the depolymerization of central F-actin in the RPMVECs. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the overexpression of Angptl4 exerts protective, anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic effects. It represents a novel therapeutic target gene for the treatment of acute lung injury induced by LPS.
