Various psychological observations have suggested that the spontaneously generated behaviors of humans reflect statistical structures extracted via perceptual learning of everyday practices and experiences while interacting with the world. Although those studies have further suggested that such acquired statistical structures use chunking, which generates a variety of complex actions recognized in compositional manner, the underlying neural mechanism has not been clarified. The current neuro-robotics study presents a model prediction for the mechanism and an evaluation of the model through physically grounded experiments on action imitation learning. The model features learning of a mapping from intentional states to action sequences based on multiple timescales dynamics characteristics. The experimental results suggest that deterministic chaos self-organized in the slower timescale part of the network dynamics is responsible for generating spontaneous transitions among primitive actions by reflecting the extracted statistical structures. The robustness of action generation in a noisy physical environment is preserved. These results agree with other neuroscience evidence of the hierarchical organization in the cortex for voluntary actions. Finally, as presented in a discussion of the results, the deterministic cortical dynamics are presumed crucial in generating not only more intentional fixed action sequences but also less intentional spontaneously transitive action sequences.
