 The fractional rates of catabolism of isotopically labeled mouse, human, bovine, and guinea pig γ-globulins and human serum albumin were determined in mice and in guinea pigs whose serum γ-globulin and serum albumin levels were elevated by immunization or by injections of exogenous serum proteins. These serum proteins were also followed in mice with different serum γ-globulin levels due to different bacterial environments. The fractional rates of catabolism of the labeled γ-globulins from all species tested were markedly increased in mice with elevated γ-globulins due to immunization; to injections of human, mouse, guinea pig, or rabbit γ-globulins; to exposure to supra normal numbers of bacteria in the environment. Injections of bovine γ-globulin were only partially effective, and injections of human serum albumin had no effect. The γ-globulin catabolic rates were decreased in mice with subnormal serum γ-globulin levels (germfree mice). The catabolic rate of human serum albumin was essentially the same in all mice in spite of differences in serum γ-globulin levels. In contrast, elevation of the serum γ-globulin levels by injections of exogenous γ-globulins or by hyperimmunization with keyhole limpet hemocyanin produced no change in the fractional catabolic rates of the isotopically labeled γ-globulins and labeled albumin in guinea pigs. Thus, a feedback mechanism for the control of the serum γ-globulin concentration appears to be operative in the mouse, but not in the guinea pig. Guinea pigs immunized with antigens in complete Freund's adjuvant or a saline suspension of killed
