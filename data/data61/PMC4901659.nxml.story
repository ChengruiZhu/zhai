From an ongoing prospective cohort study, 1394 patients that underwent primary isolated ACL reconstruction within 3 months of injury with autograft tissue without medial collateral, lateral collateral, or posterior cruciate injury requiring treatment or prior contralateral ACL injury were identified. Demographic data, physical examination findings under anesthesia at the time of ACL reconstruction, information regarding meniscus status and treatment, and pre-operative and 2 year post-operative International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Knee Related Quality of Life subscale (KOOS-QOL), and Marx activity scores were collected. Patients reported by the operating surgeons as having a Lachman or anterior drawer examination at least 10mm greater than the contralateral side were classified as having a high grade Lachman or anterior drawer respectively. Patients reported by the operating surgeon as having a 3+ pivot-shift were classified as having a high-grade pivot-shift. Patients demonstrating high-grade laxity on any of these examinations were classified as having high-grade pre-operative knee laxity. Multiple logistic regression modeling was used to evaluate whether having high-grade pre-operative laxity was associated with increased odds of undergoing revision ACL reconstruction within 2 years of the index procedure, controlling for patient age, sex, activity level, and graft type. Multiple linear regression modeling was used to evaluate whether having high-grade pre-operative laxity was associated with poorer IKDC or KOOS-QOL scores at 2 years post-operative, controlling for patient age, sex, BMI, and smoking status, baseline score, activity level, graft type, and the presence and treatment of meniscal tears.
