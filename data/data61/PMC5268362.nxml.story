Angiogenesis is a hallmark of tumour growth and a key feature for invasion and metastasis. Thus, to elucidate the governing biological processes of cancer development, it is instructive to develop physiologically representative mathematical and computational (in-silico) models with which to compare to experimental data. We present a validated, three-dimensional, in-silico model of tumour-induced angiogenesis and growth—unique in the field of mathematical cancer modelling in its biophysical prescription and predictive accuracy. Our novel modelling approach encompasses the effects of both biochemical and biomechanical processes on the development of angiogenic vasculature and solid tumour growth. Unlike other works—which typically focus on biochemical processes—our model depicts a dynamic and coupled biophysical system of the tumour-host microenvironment. In concert with in-vivo experimental data, we have a physiologically-representative in-silico model that enables us to classify and rank the governing biological processes. This yielded the remarkable discovery that it is necessary to include biomechanical factors to accurately describe angiogenic topology. Our model not only provides insight into fundamental cancer biophysics, but is also a powerful tool to aid in our overall objective of re-engineering the tumour microenvironment to optimise the delivery of therapeutic drugs.
