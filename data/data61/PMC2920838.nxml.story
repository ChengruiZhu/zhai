Endogenous human centromeres are defined by large arrays of α-satellite DNA. A portion of each α-satellite array is assembled into CENP-A chromatin, the structural and functional platform for kinetochore formation. Most chromosomes are monocentric, meaning they have a single centromere. However, genome rearrangement can produce chromosomes with two centromeres (dicentrics). In most organisms, dicentrics typically break during cell division; however, dicentric human chromosomes can be stable in mitosis and meiosis. This stability reflects centromere inactivation, a poorly understood phenomenon in which one centromere is functionally silenced. To explore molecular and genomic events that occur at the time of dicentric formation, we describe a cell-based system to create dicentric human chromosomes and monitor their behavior after formation. Such dicentrics can experience several fates, including centromere inactivation, breakage, or maintaining two functional centromeres. Unexpectedly, we also find that dicentrics with large (>20Mb) inter-centromeric distances are stable through at least 20 cell divisions. Our results highlight similarities and differences in dicentric behavior between humans and model organisms, and they provide evidence for one mechanism of centromere inactivation by centromeric deletion in some dicentrics. The ability to create dicentric human chromosomes provides a system to test other mechanisms of centromere disassembly and dicentric chromosome stability.
