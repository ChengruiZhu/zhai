Volumetric‐modulated arc therapy (VMAT) is an effective but complex technique for delivering radiation therapy. VMAT relies on precise combinations of dose rate, gantry speed, and multileaf collimator (MLC) shapes to deliver intensity‐modulated patterns. Such complexity warrants the development of correspondingly robust performance verification systems. In this work, we report on a remote, automated software system for daily delivery verification of VMAT treatments. The performance verification software system consists of three main components: (1) a query module for retrieving daily MLC, gantry, and jaw positions reported by the linear accelerator control system to the record and verify system; (2) an analysis module which reads the daily delivery report generated from the database query module, compares the reported treatment positions against the planned positions, and compiles delivery position error reports; and (3) a graphical reporting module which displays reports initiated by a user anywhere within the institutional network or which can be configured to alert authorized users when predefined tolerance values are exceeded. The utility of the system was investigated through analysis of patient data collected at our clinic. Nearly 2500 VMAT fractions have been analyzed with the delivery verification system at our institution. The average percentage of reported MLC leaf positions within 3 mm, gantry positions within 2°, and jaw positions within 3 mm of their planned positions was
