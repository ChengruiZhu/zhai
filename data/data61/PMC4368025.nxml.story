Objectives: To evaluate hemodynamic changes of blood pressure and heart rate on hypertensive patients undergoing tooth extraction using various types of local anesthesia (LA).
Study Design: A prospective randomized clinical trial was conducted on 45 hypertensive patients who were divided equally into 3 parallel groups according to LA received. Group 1: Lidociane 2% with epinephrine 1: 80,000. Group 2: Prilocaine 3% with Felypressin 0.03 IU/ml. Group 3: Mepivacaine 3% plain. Inclusion criteria: hypertensive patients, under medical management with blood pressure ≤ 159/99. Exclusion criteria: Blood pressure ≥160 /100 and patients receiving β blockers. Negative aspiration was mandatory before the injection of 2 cartridges of LA. Blood pressure and heart rate were evaluated by Electronic Sphygmomanometer and Pulse Oximeters in 3 different time-points; 3 minutes before LA, three minutes after LA and three minutes after extraction.
Results: The mean of systolic blood pressure (SBP) had increased after LA injection, and then decreased after extraction in the 3 groups of patients. Increase of SBP after extraction with (Mepivacaine plain) was higher than (Lidociane with Epinephrine) and the difference was statistically significant using ANOVA (p=0.037). The differences in the mean heart rates and mean diastolic blood pressures in the 3 groups were not significant.
Conclusions: The increase of blood pressure with Epinephrine and Felypressin is negligible. Therefore, it is safe to use 2 cartridges of Lidociane 2% with Epinephrine 1:80,000 or Prilocaine 3% with Felypressin 0.03 IU/ml for hypertensive patients whose blood pressure ≤ 159/99 provided negative aspiration is verified before injection.
