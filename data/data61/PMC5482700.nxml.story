Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and tumor cells (CTC) are novel approaches for identifying genomic alterations. Thus, we designed a meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic value and prognostic significance of a KRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase (KRAS) mutation for lung cancer patients. All included articles were from PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library. Twelve articles that described 1,131 patients were reviewed. True positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN), and false negatives (FN) were used to calculate pooled sensitivity, specificity, the positive likelihood ratio (PLR), the negative likelihood ratio (NLR), a diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), the area under the curve (AUC) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). PLR is calculated as sensitivity/(1-specificity) and NLR is (1– sensitivity)/specificity. DOR is a measured of diagnostic effectiveness (PLR/NLR). A survival analysis subgroup was also designed to evaluate prognostic significance. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, PLR, NLR, DOR and AUC were 0.79 (95% CI, 0.63-0.89), 0.93 (95% CI, 0.89-0.96), 12.13 (92% CI, 7.11-20.67), 0.22 (95% CI, 0.12-0.41), 54.82 (95% CI, 23.11-130.09), and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.93–0.96), respectively. KRAS mutation and wild-type hazard ratios for overall survival and progression-free survival were 1.37 (95% CI, 1.08–1.66), 1.46 (95% CI, 1.15-1.77) in blood samples, and 1.16 (95% CI, 1.03–1.28), 1.28 (95% CI, 1.09–1.46) in tumor tissue.
