Tissue macrophages play important roles in maintaining homeostasis in most organs of the body including the brain where microglia represent the resident phagocytic cells of this compartment. The possibility of one day harnessing macrophage plasticity to treat or ameliorate disorders including obesity, cancer, organ damage, intestinal disorders, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular disease in which these cells play a role, is a very exciting prospect. Inflammatory signaling is required for regenerative repair, healing, and pathogen clearance functions. However, when the inflammatory response persists in a chronic fashion over an extended period of time, damage to neurons is followed by neuronal injury and dysfunction. Macrophages in the brain are heterogeneous arising from tissues during embryogenesis, and in the adult, from bone marrow derived monocytes that enter through the bloodâ€“brain-barrier. While much of our insight regarding macrophage functional subtypes has been garnered through elegant studies in mice, which are amenable to genetic manipulation, far less is known about such cells in human tissues, and particularly in the brain under normal, disease, or injurious conditions. In this regard, non-human primate models for human immunodeficiency virus have been extremely useful for understanding the contribution of bone marrow-derived monocytes in neurological disease and their interaction and impact on the activation state of resident microglia in the brain. This review will focus on what has been learned from the rhesus macaque models about the types of macrophages present in the brains of animals with encephalitis.
