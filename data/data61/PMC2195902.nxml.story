Coronary artery thrombosis is often initiated by abrupt disruption of the atherosclerotic plaque and activation of platelets on the subendothelial layers in the disrupted plaque. The extracellular matrix protein collagen is the most thrombogenic constituent of the subendothelial layer; therefore, a selective inhibition of the collagen activation pathway in platelets may provide strong antithrombotic protection while preserving other platelet functions. Here we demonstrate that treatment of mice with a monoclonal antibody against the activating platelet collagen receptor glycoprotein VI (GPVI; JAQ1) results in specific depletion of the receptor from circulating platelets and abolished responses of these cells to collagen and collagen-related peptides (CRPs). JAQ1-treated mice were completely protected for at least 2 wk against lethal thromboembolism induced by infusion of a mixture of collagen (0.8 mg/kg) and epinephrine (60 Î¼g/ml). The tail bleeding times in JAQ1-treated mice were only moderately increased compared with control mice probably because the treatment did not affect platelet activation by other agonists such as adenosine diphosphate or phorbol myristate acetate. These results suggest that GPVI might become a target for long-term prophylaxis of ischemic cardiovascular diseases and provide the first evidence that it is possible to specifically deplete an activating glycoprotein receptor from circulating platelets in vivo.
