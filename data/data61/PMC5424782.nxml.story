Several key biological events adopt a “hit-and-run” strategy in their transient interactions between binding partners. In some instances, the disordered nature of one of the binding partners severely hampers the success of co-crystallization, often leading to the crystallization of just one of the partners. Here, we discuss a method to trap weak and transient protein interactions for crystallization. This approach requires the structural details of at least one of the interacting partners and binding knowledge to dock the known minimum binding region (peptide) of the protein onto the other using an optimal-sized linker. Prior to crystallization, the purified linked construct should be verified for its intact folding and stability. Following structure determination, structure-guided functional studies are performed with independent, full-length unlinked proteins to validate the findings of the linked complex. We designed this approach and then validated its efficacy using a 24 amino acid minimum binding region of the intrinsically disordered, neuron-specific substrates, Neurogranin and Neuromodulin, joined via a Gly-linker to their interacting partner, Calmodulin. Moreover, the reported functional studies with independent full-length proteins confirmed the findings of the linked peptide complexes. Based on our studies, and in combination with the supporting literature, we suggest that optimized linkers can provide an environment to mimic the natural interactions between binding partners, and offer a useful strategy for structural studies to trap weak and transient interactions involved in several biological processes.
