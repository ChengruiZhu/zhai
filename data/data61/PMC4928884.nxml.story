As GWAS continue to grow in sample size, it is evident that these studies need to be utilized more effectively for detecting individual susceptibility variants, and more importantly, to provide insight into global genetic architecture of complex traits. Towards this goal, identifying association with respect to a collection of variants in biological pathways can be particularly insightful for understanding how networks of genes might be affecting pathophysiology of diseases. Here we present a new pathway analysis procedure that can be conducted using summary-level association statistics, which have become the main vehicle for performing meta-analysis of individual genetic variants across studies in large consortia. Through simulation studies we showed the proposed method was more powerful than the existing state-of-art method. We carried out a comprehensive pathway analysis of 4,713 candidate pathways on their association with T2D using two large studies with European ancestry and identified 43 T2D-associated pathways. Further examinations of those 43 pathways in 8 Asian studies showed that some pathways were trans-ethnically associated with T2D. This analysis clearly highlights novel T2D-associated pathways beyond what has been known from single-variant association analysis reported from largest GWAS to date. We also identify a novel locus for T2D in the European populations at chromosome 17q21 (rs1058018,
