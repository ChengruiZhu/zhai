Breast cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors among females worldwide and remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Due to the heterogeneous clinical nature of breast cancer, it is necessary to identify new biomarkers that are associated with tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis. Osteopontin (OPN) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) are known to be overexpressed in invasive breast cancer and their overexpression is associated with aggressive histological and clinical features. The present study assessed OPN and COX-2 expression in various subtypes of breast cancer. The expression of OPN and COX-2 was analyzed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a cohort of 67 invasive ductal breast carcinoma patients. The statistical analysis was performed using standard statistical software SPSS version 18.0. The associations between OPN and COX-2 and the human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)-overexpressing and non-HER2-overexpressing subtypes were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U test. The mean OPN level was significantly higher in the HER2-overexpressing subtype compared with the non-HER2-overexpressing subtype. Furthermore, the mean COX-2 expression levels were higher in the HER2-overexpressing subtype compared with the luminal A, luminal B or triple-negative groups. It is well known that carcinomas overexpressing HER2/neu have a worse prognosis than luminal tumors. Hence, it may be hypothesized that an elevated expression of OPN and COX-2 in a HER2-overexpressing subtype may contribute to a more aggressive behavior and be used as diagnostic and prognostic markers in breast cancer.
