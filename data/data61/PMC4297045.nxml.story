Osteochondral lesions of the talus are common injuries following acute and chronic ankle sprains. Numerous surgical treatment strategies have been employed for treating these lesions; arthroscopic bone marrow stimulation is recognized as the first-line technique to provide fibrocartilage infill of the defect site. While the short- and medium-term outcomes of this technique are good, the long-term outcomes are not yet known. An increasing number of studies, however, show a cause for concern in employing this technique, including declining outcome scores over time. The current authors have therefore developed a treatment strategy based on previously established guidelines in addition to morphological cartilage-sensitive fast spin echo techniques and quantitative T2 mapping magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Accordingly, the authors advocate arthroscopic bone marrow stimulation in lesion sizes up to 8 mm in diameter and osteochondral autograft transplant (OATS) in lesion sizes greater than 8 mm in diameter. In the absence of long-term studies, confining the use of arthroscopic bone marrow stimulation to smaller lesions may support prolonged joint life by decreasing the rate at which the fibrocartilage ultimately degenerates over time. Employing the OATS procedure in larger lesions has the advantage of replacing “like with like.” The current review examines the role of arthroscopic bone marrow stimulation techniques of the talus.
