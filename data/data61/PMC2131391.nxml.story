 The results of these observations may be briefly summarized as follows: Feeding of hematoporphyrin to white mice over long periods of time produced no apparent changes in these animals and had no effect upon their sensitivity to light. Albino and slightly pigmented mice and rats injected with hematoporphyrin were protected from the rays of the sun by staining them a blue-black color with Verhoeff's hematoxylin. The dioxyphenylalanine (Dopa) reaction revealed no changes in the cutaneous pigment of animals injected with hematoporphyrin and exposed to sunlight, kept in the dark or diffused daylight. It was therefore assumed that the natural pigment of the skin plays only a physical r√¥le in protecting animals injected with hematoporphyrin from sunlight. Exposure to sunlight of only the intestine and mesentery of a cat under ether anesthesia, which had been injected with hematoporphyrin, was followed by death of the animal. Repeated injections into white mice of large amounts of blood from guinea pigs in hematoporphyrin shock failed to produce symptoms of hematoporphyrin shock. In a parabiosis experiment, one of a pair of white rats promptly developed characteristic symptoms and died when injected with hematoporphyrin and exposed to sunlight, while the other animal, which was protected from light, but whose circulation had been demonstrated to connect freely with that of its partner, showed no changes during the entire procedure. It has, therefore, been impossible, so far, to demonstrate any substance present in the blood of animals in hematoporphyrin shock which is capable of reproducing this condition in other animals when introduced into the circulation. Injection of hematoporphyrin followed by exposure of the entire animal to sunlight has been found to produce physiological changes in cats similar to those observed in traumatic shock. There promptly occurred a rapid fall of blood pressure to a very low level and marked lowering of body temperature. The venous blood was found to be poor in oxygen, rich in carbon dioxide and to show low carbon dioxide-combining power. The respiration, which first was accelerated, later on became deep and irregular. The reflexes and typical blood pressure responses to cutaneous and vagal stimulation could always be obtained until death. Marked diminution of oxygen and increase of carbon dioxide content were found to occur in mixtures of blood and hematoporphyrin exposed
