Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) has been identified and biochemically characterized in epigenetics; however, the pathological roles of its dysfunction in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia remain to be elucidated. In this study, we evaluated LSD1, and histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4)me1 and H3K4me2 expression in patients with MCL and silenced LSD1 in JeKo-1 and MOLT-4 cells, in order to define its role in JeKo-1 and MOLT-4 cell proliferation and apoptosis. We retrospectively analyzed the protein expression of LSD1, and mono- and dimethylated H3K4 (H3K4me1 and H3K4me2), and cyclin D1 and Ki67 in 30 cases of MCL by immunohistochemistry. The correlation of LSD1, H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 with Ki67 was determined by statistical analysis. LSD1 was silenced by small interfering RNA (siRNA). Cell apoptosis and cell proliferation were detected by flow cytometry and 3- (4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The protein expression levels of LSD1, histone methylated H3K4, histone acetylated H3, cyclin D1, apoptotic proteins, p15 and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) were examined by western blot analysis. We demonstrated that LSD1 was upregulated, and that H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 were downregulated in the cases with MCL, compared to those with proliferative lymphadenitis (p<0.05). LSD1 positively correlated with Ki67 in MCL [Cohen's kappa (κ)=0.667, p<0.01]. There was no significant correlation between H3K4me1 and H3K4me2, and Ki67 (κ=−0.182, p>0.05, κ=−0.200, p>0.05). The silencing of LSD1 decreased the levels of the apoptosis-related proteins, Bcl-2, pro-caspase-3 and C-myc, and decreased those of DNMT1 and increased p15, and resulted in the loss of cell viability and the induction apoptosis. The silencing of LSD1 increased the expression of H3K4me1 and H3K4me2, and histone acetylated H3 in the JeKo-1 and MOLT-4 cells. LSD1 siRNA also decreased cyclin D1 expression in the JeKo-1 cells. On the whole, our findings demonstrate that the overexpression of LSD1 may be associated with the pathogenesis in MCL. We demonstrated that the silencing of LSD1 is capable of removing the mono- and dimethyl groups from H3K4, and upregulating the histone acetylation of H3 in JeKo-1 and MOLT-4 cells. The silencing of LSD1 inhibited cell growth and induced cell apoptosis. Of note, in JeKo-1 cells, the silencing of LSD1 decreased cyclin D1 expression, which is one of the genes that contribute to the pathogenesis of MCL. LSD1 may thus be a possible therapeutic target in MCL and acute lymphoblastic leukemia MOLT-4 cells.
