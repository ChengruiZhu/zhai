We have isolated the gene encoding the delta subunit of the mouse skeletal muscle acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and have identified a 148- bp cis-acting region that controls cell type-specific and differentiation-dependent gene expression. The 5' flanking region of the delta subunit gene was fused to the protein-coding region of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene and gene fusions were transfected into C2 mouse skeletal muscle cells. Both transiently and stably transfected cells were assayed for CAT gene expression. Deletions from the 5' end of the mouse delta gene demonstrate that 148 bp of 5' flanking DNA is sufficient to confer cell type-specific and differentiation-dependent expression: CAT activity is present in transfected myotubes, but not in transfected 3T3 cells or 10T1/2 cells. Moreover, the level of CAT expression in myotubes transfected with constructs containing 148 bp of 5' flanking DNA from the delta subunit gene is identical to that in myotubes transfected with constructs containing 3.2 kb of 5' flanking DNA and similar to expression from the SV-40 early promoter. Increased CAT activity in myotubes is a result of an increased rate of transcription from the delta subunit promoter, since CAT RNA levels are also 35-fold more abundant in myotubes than myoblasts. In contrast, the SV-40 early promoter is similarly active in all cell types. Thus, 148 bp of 5' flanking DNA from the delta subunit gene contains all the information required for cell type-specific and differentiation-dependent expression of the AChR delta subunit.
