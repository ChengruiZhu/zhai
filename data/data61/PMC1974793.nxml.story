The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of rivastigmine therapy on attention, apathy, anxiety and agitation in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a real-world clinical setting. Patients with mild-to-moderate AD were enrolled in the study by physicians across Canada. They were treated with open-label rivastigmine (dose at the discretion of the prescribing physicians) for a period of 6 months. Changes from baseline in attention, apathy, anxiety and agitation were assessed using an abbreviated Clinician's Global Impression of Change at 3- and 6-month visits. The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) was also used at these visits. Use and changes in use of psychotropic medications were recorded, as were changes in caregiver burden. Analyses of subgroups (outpatients vs. institutionalised patients) were also performed. A total of 2119 patients were enrolled in the study by 375 physicians. At baseline, 91% had deficits in attention, 85.4% had symptoms of anxiety, 78.5% exhibited apathy and 70.1% showed agitation. At 6 months, 67.5% of evaluable patients had improved on the symptom of attention, while 62.3%, 62.6% and 56.0% had improvements in anxiety, apathy and agitation respectively. The percentages with improvements were higher in the institutional subgroup than among outpatients. There was an overall mean improvement of 1.1 points on the MMSE at 6 months. Approximately four times as many caregivers reported a reduced burden than an increased burden at 6 months (40.3% vs. 10.3%). The majority of patients treated with rivastigmine experienced improvements in attention, anxiety, apathy and agitation. These real-life findings further demonstrate the proven efficacy of rivastigmine in patients with mild-to-moderate AD.
