 During the initial period following immersion of parenchymatous cells of liver, kidney, or pancreas in various fluids immediately after their removal from the body water exchange is like that which occurs when water passes by osmosis through a semipermeable membrane; intake of water is proportional to the square root of the elapsed time and when liver tissue is immersed in solutions of sodium chloride movement of water is approximately proportional to the concentration of the solution. Solutions of sodium chloride isotonic for parenchymatous cells of liver have twice the molar concentration of sodium chloride in the blood serum; for those of the kidney slightly less than twice and for those of the pancreas three times this concentration. When interstitial tissue of thymus, omentum, or pancreas is immersed in water, it undergoes edema-like swelling caused by hydration of the colloids of the fibrous tissue; quantitative water exchange in an initial period accords with water movement by osmosis and is proportional to the square root of the elapsed time. Solutions of sodium chloride isotonic for fibrous tissue of the omentum have slightly greater molar concentration than the sodium chloride in the blood serum and for that of the thymus approximately the same as that of blood serum. Sodium chloride produces changes in fibrous tissue which increase with increasing concentration its power to hold water; the dense fibrous tissue of the corium of the skin and of the wall of the aorta takes up water in both weak an strong solutions of sodium chloride. The initial movement of water induced in tissues in the period immediately following removal from the body is dependent upon forces which are active during life but soon impaired by injury to the tissues. The molar concentration of the contents of secreting cells is greater than that of the blood serum and of the fluid surrounding them. These conditions are favorable to the passage of water from the tissue spaces to the cells.
