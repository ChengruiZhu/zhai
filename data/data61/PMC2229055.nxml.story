Charge movement was measured in frog cut twitch fibers with the double Vaseline gap technique. Five manipulations listed below were applied to investigate their effects on the hump component (I gamma) in the ON segments of TEST minus CONTROL current traces. When external Cl-1 was replaced by MeSO3- to eliminate Cl current, I gamma peaked earlier due to a few millivolts shift of the voltage dependence of I gamma kinetics in the negative direction. The Q-V plots in the TEA.Cl and TEA.MeSO3 solutions were well fitted by a sum of two Boltzmann distribution functions. The more steeply voltage-dependent component (Q gamma) had a V approximately 6 mV more negative in the TEA.MeSO3 solution than in the TEA.Cl solution. These voltage shifts were partially reversible. When creatine phosphate in the end pool solution was removed, the I gamma hump disappeared slowly over the course of 20-30 min, partly due to a suppression of Q gamma. The hump reappeared when creatine phosphate was restored. When 0.2-1.0 mM Cd2+ was added to the center pool solution to block inward Ca current, the I gamma hump became less prominent due to a prolongation in the time course of I gamma but not to a suppression of Q gamma. When the holding potential was changed from -90 to -120 mV, the amplitude of I beta was increased, thereby obscuring the I gamma hump. Finally, when a cut fiber was stimulated repetitively, I gamma lost its hump appearance because its time course was prolonged. In an extreme case, a 5-min resting interval was insufficient for a complete recovery of the waveform. In general, a stimulation rate of once per minute had a negligible effect on the shape of I gamma. Of the five manipulations, MeSO3- has the least perturbation on the appearance of I gamma and is potentially a better substitute for Cl- than SO2-(4) in eliminating Cl current if the appearance of the I gamma hump is to be preserved.
