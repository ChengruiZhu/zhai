Extrarenal rhabdoid tumors (ERRTs) are extremely rare neoplasms; of these, colorectal ERRTs are the most rare, and only nine cases have been previously described in the English language literature. The current study reports the pathological features of a case of poorly differentiated cecal adenocarcinoma with prominent rhabdoid feature, which was combined with mucinous cystadenoma of the appendix in a 73-year-old male, and additionally reviews the previously reported cases. Microscopically, the majority of tumor cells were non-cohesive or loosely cohesive, with a polygonal morphology and prominent rhabdoid feature, showing eccentric vesicular nuclei, prominent nucleoli and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin (CK) and vimentin, but negative for CK20, CK7, desmin and smooth muscle actin. This indicated a diagnosis of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with prominent rhabdoid features, combined with appendiceal mucinous cystadenoma. At two months following surgery the patient succumbed to peritoneal seeding and metastasis of liver and bone The emergence of the rhabdoid phenotype is invariably associated with an aggressive and almost always fatal clinical course. The present case is the 10th example of such a tumor in the colon, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of colonic rhabdoid tumor coinciding with appendiceal benign mucinous neoplasm.
