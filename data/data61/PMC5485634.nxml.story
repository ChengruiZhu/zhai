Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in American women. Chemoresistance is common and inevitable after a variable period of time. Therefore, chemosensitization is a necessary strategy on drug-resistant breast cancer. In this study, MCF-7 breast cancer cell was cultured under hypoxia for a week to induce the resistance to doxorubincin (DOX). The effect of different doses of berberine, a traditional Chinese medicine, on DOX sensitivity to MFC-7/hypoxia cells was observed. We found that hypoxia increased DOX resistance on breast cancer cells with the AMPK activation. Low-dose berberine could resensitize DOX chemosensitivity in MCF-7/hypoxia cell, however, high-dose berberine directly induced apoptosis. The intriguing fact was that the protein expressions of AMPK and HIF-1α were down-regulated by berberine, either low dose or high dose. But the downstream of HIF-1α occurred the bifurcation dependent on the dosage of berberine: AMPK-HIF-1α-P-gp inactivation played a crucial role on the DOX chemosensitivity of low-dose berberine, while AMPK-HIF-1α downregulaton inducing p53 activation led to apoptosis in high-dose berberine. These results were consistent to the transplanted mice model bearing MCF-7 drug-resistance tumor treated by berberine combined with DOX or high-dose berberine alone. This work shed light on a potentially therapeutic attempt to overcome drug-resistant breast cancer.
