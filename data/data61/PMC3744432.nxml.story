Interpreting patterns of DNA sequence variation in the genomes of closely related species is critically important for understanding the causes and functional effects of nucleotide substitutions. Classical models describe patterns of substitution in terms of the fundamental forces of mutation, recombination, neutral drift, and natural selection. However, an entirely separate force, called GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC), also appears to have an important influence on substitution patterns in many species. gBGC is a recombination-associated evolutionary process that favors the fixation of strong (G/C) over weak (A/T) alleles. In mammals, gBGC is thought to promote variation in GC content, rapidly evolving sequences, and the fixation of deleterious mutations. However, its genome-wide influence remains poorly understood, in part because, it is difficult to incorporate gBGC into statistical models of evolution. In this paper, we describe a new evolutionary model that jointly describes the effects of selection and gBGC and apply it to the human and chimpanzee genomes. Our genome-wide predictions of gBGC tracts indicate that gBGC has been an important force in recent human evolution. Our publicly available computer program, called phastBias, and our genome-wide predictions will enable other researchers to consider gBGC in their analyses.
