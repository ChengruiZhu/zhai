Abnormal synchronous activation of the glutamatergic olivo-cerebellar pathway has been suggested to be crucial for the harmaline-induced tremor. The cerebellum receives two catecholaminergic pathways: the dopaminergic pathway arising from the ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra pars compacta, and the noradrenergic one from the locus coeruleus. The aim of the present study was to examine a contribution of the cerebellar catecholaminergic innervations to the harmaline-induced tremor in rats. Rats were injected bilaterally into the cerebellar vermis with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA; 8 μg/0.5 μl) either alone or this treatment was preceded (30 min earlier) by desipramine (15 mg/kg ip). Harmaline was administered to animals in doses of 7.5 or 15 mg/kg ip. Tremor of forelimbs was measured as a number of episodes during a 90-min observation. Rats were killed by decapitation 30 or 120 min after harmaline treatment. The levels of dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin, and their metabolites were measured by HPLC in the cerebellum, substantia nigra, caudate–putamen, and frontal cortex. 6-OHDA injected alone enhanced the harmaline-induced tremor. Furthermore, it decreased the noradrenaline level by ca. 40–80% in the cerebellum and increased the levels of serotonin and 5-HIAA in the caudate–putamen and frontal cortex in untreated and/or harmaline-treated animals. When 6-OHDA treatment was preceded by desipramine, it decreased dopaminergic transmission in some regions of the cerebellum while inducing its compensatory activation in others. The latter lesion did not markedly influence the tremor induced by harmaline. The present study indicates that noradrenergic innervation of the cerebellum interacts with cerebral serotonergic systems and plays an inhibitory role in the harmaline-induced tremor.
