The adhesive interactions of circulating blood cells are tightly regulated, receptor-mediated events. To establish a model for studies on regulation of cell adhesion, we have examined the adhesive properties of the HD11 chick myeloblast cell line. Function-perturbing antibodies were used to show that integrins containing the beta 1 subunit mediate HD11 cell attachment to several distinct extracellular matrix proteins, specifically fibronectin, collagen, vitronectin, and fibrinogen. This is the first evidence that an integrin heterodimer in the beta 1 family functions as a receptor for fibrinogen. While the alpha v beta 1 heterodimer has been shown to function as a vitronectin receptor on some cells, this heterodimer could not be detected on HD11 cells. Instead, results suggest that the beta 1 subunit associates with different, unidentified alpha subunit(s) to form receptors for vitronectin and fibrinogen. Results using function-blocking antibodies also demonstrate that on these cells, additional receptors for vitronectin are formed by alpha v beta 3 and alpha v associated with an unidentified 100-kD beta subunit. The adhesive interactions of HD11 cells with these extracellular matrix ligands were shown to be regulated by lipopolysaccharide treatment, making the HD11 cell line attractive for studies of mechanisms regulating cell adhesion. In contrast to primary macrophage which rapidly exhibit enhanced adhesion to laminin and collagen upon activation, activated HD11 cells exhibited reduced adhesion to most extracellular matrix constituents.
