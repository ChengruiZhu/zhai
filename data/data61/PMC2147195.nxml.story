 subjected to electrical currents (direct or alternating) undergo remarkable changes. Certain minute granules just inside the surface of the egg absorb water and swell to more than 300 times their original size and thereby produce a mass of jelly which surrounds the egg with a zone about as wide as the original diameter of the egg. The amount of direct current is too small to produce any change of color in eggs stained with neutral red. In direct current the jelly appears first on the side toward the anode and moves toward the anode. In alternating current it appears on opposite sides facing the electrodes. It might be thought that the current changes the chemical character of the granules so that they are able to absorb very large quantities of water but this seems unlikely. If the current is shut off after 1 minute the swelling continues. This might be explained on the ground that each jelly precursor granule is covered with a waterproof film which is removed by the current. It does not seem probable that the effect is due to heat produced by the current since the exposure is so short. It seems possible that the current may strip off micelles from the waterproof covering of the granules and allow water to penetrate. The fact that alternating current is more effective than direct current might be explained on the ground that the egg may be represented as a capacity in parallel with a resistance so constituted that relatively little direct current can enter. The non-aqueous film which covers the surface of the protoplasm appears to be liquid rather than solid.
