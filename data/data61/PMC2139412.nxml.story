 In this study a variety of human lymphocytes of known B or T cell type, obtained from multiple sources, were prepared for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) by the critical point drying method. Distinction between normal B and T lymphocytes was relatively easy in most instances, on the basis of their surface architecture. Using immunological methods, between 20 and 30% of normal peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were identified as B cells and from 69 to 82% as T cells. SEM results showed that 20% of the PBL had a complex villous surface and approximately 80% of cells were smaller and had a relatively smooth surface. Comparison of the above data and enrichment of B cells from PBL, by centrifugation after T cell rosettes had formed, indicated that the "villous" cells were B lymphocytes and the "relatively smooth" cells were T lymphocytes. T cells obtained from two human thymuses were also of the generally smooth cell type. Further evidence for the distinction of B and T lymphocytes, on the basis of surface morphology, was obtained from the examination of cultured lymphoid cell lines of known B or T cell derivation. Cells from cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia also provided support for the above interpretations. Five of six untreated cases were clearly of B cell type by immunologic and SEM criteria. One unusual case showed the presence of T and B lymphocytes in almost equal numbers by SEM and a mixture of B and T cells by immunologic markers. An additional case that had received chemotherapy showed numerous atypical cells that were difficult to classify by SEM. Detailed examination of the smoother T cells showed that at least half of them had a moderate number of surface digitations and a small proportion had an intermediate surface morphology with a relatively large number of surface digitations. The latter presented difficulties in classification and may correspond to different stages of differentiation and represent subpopulations of lymphocytes. The distinction between human B and T lymphocytes on the basis of their surface architecture can be made by SEM of critical point dried samples, with relative ease in most but not all instances. The effects of stimulation, cell cycle, differentiation, intercellular contact, and density of cell population, on the surface architecture of lymphoid cells, remain to be determined.
