Several researchers have hypothesized that shade avoidance behaviour is favoured by natural selection because it increases the fitness of individuals. Shade avoidance can be disadvantageous for crops, however, because it reduces allocation of resources to reproductive yield, increases the risk of lodging and reduces weed suppression. One approach to develop varieties with reduced shade avoidance and enhanced agronomic performance is by inducing mutations followed by phenotypic screening. We treated spring wheat seeds with ethyl methanesulfonate and screened the seedlings repeatedly under green filters for plants showing reduced elongation of the first leaf sheath and second leaf lamina. The shade avoidance responses of five promising mutant lines were further compared to non-mutated plants in a climate chamber experiment with added far-red light. Two of the selected lines displayed significantly reduced elongation under all light treatments while two lines showed reduced elongation only in added far-red light. The most promising mutant line did not differ in height from the non-mutated cultivar in neutral light, but elongated 20.6% less in strong far-red light. This traditional forward approach of screening mutagenized spring wheat produced plants with reduced shade avoidance responses. These mutants may generate new molecular handles to modify the reaction of plants to changes in light spectral distribution in traditional and novel cultivation systems.
