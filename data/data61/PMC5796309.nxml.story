Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) allows neoplastic cells to gain the invasive phenotype and become migratory, which is required for cancer progression and metastasis. In the present study, the expression of EMT-associated biomarkers and their association with clinicopathological parameters in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) was investigated. E-cadherin, N-cadherin, β-catenin and zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) protein expression was evaluated with immunohistochemistry in a cohort of 76 patients with operable LSCC. The association between these transition markers, clinicopathological parameters and their prognostic impact in LSCC was analyzed. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that EMT-associated proteins were differentially expressed between LSCC and adjacent non-neoplastic laryngeal tissue. Negative E-cadherin expression and positive N-cadherin, β-catenin and ZEB2 expression were associated with a later tumor (T) stage, decreasing tumor differentiation and a reduced overall survival (OS) time (OS: E-cadherin, P=0.016; N-cadherin, P=0.003; β-catenin, P=0.002; ZEB2, P=0.0003). E-cadherin/β-catenin co-expression was significantly associated with the majority of clinicopathological parameters assessed, including lymph node metastases, T stage and tumor cell differentiation (P=0.004, P=0.005, and P<0.001, respectively). Multivariate analysis indicated that T stage and the positive expression of β-catenin and ZEB2 were independent risk factors for OS in LSCC (P=0.014, P=0.025 and P=0.003, respectively). It was concluded that EMT mediates tumor progression, and reduces OS time in patients with LSCC. E-cadherin/β-catenin co-expression may be associated with clinicopathological parameters. T stage, and the positive co-expression of β-catenin and ZEB2 may be independent predictors of prognosis in LSCC.
