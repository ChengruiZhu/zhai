Resistin levels have been reported to be abnormal in obesity-related cancer patients with epidemiological studies yielding inconsistent results. Therefore, a meta-analysis was performed to assess the association between blood resistin levels and obesity-related cancer risk. A total of 13 studies were included for pooling ORs analysis. High resistin levels were found in cancer patients (OR= 1.20, 95% CI= 1.10-1.30). After excluding one study primarily contributing to between-study heterogeneity, the association between resistin levels and cancer risk was still significant (OR=1.18, 95% CI = 1.09-1.28). Stratification analysis found resistin levels were not associated with cancer risk in prospective studies. Meta-regression analysis identified factors such as geographic area, detection assay, or study design as confounders to between-study variance. The result of 18 studies of pooling measures on SMD analysis was that high resistin levels were associated with increased cancer risk (SMD = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.63-1.25), but not in the pooling SMD analysis of prospective studies. Except for the studies identified as major contributors to heterogeneity by Galbraith plot, resistin levels were still higher in cancer patients (SMD = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.63-0.87) in retrospective studies. Meta-regression analysis found factors, such as geographic area, BMI-match, size, and quality score, could account for 66.7% between-study variance in pooling SMD analysis of retrospective studies. Publication bias was not found in pooling ORs analysis. Our findings indicated high resistin levels were associated with increased obesity-related cancer risk. However, it may not be a predictor.
