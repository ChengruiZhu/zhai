tRNA molecules function as adapters in protein synthesis, bringing amino acids to the ribosome and reading the genetic code through codon-anticodon base pairing. When the tRNA contains a uridine residue in the “wobble position” of its anticodon, which base-pairs with purine residues in the third position of a cognate codon, it is almost always chemically modified and modification is required for efficient decoding. In eukaryotic cells, these wobble uridine modifications require a conserved protein complex called Elongator. Our work shows that Elp1, Elongator's largest subunit, is phosphorylated on several sites. By blocking phosphorylation at these positions using mutations, we identified four phosphorylation sites that are important for Elongator's role in tRNA modification. We have also shown that Hrr25 protein kinase, a member of the casein kinase I (CKI) family, is responsible for modification of two of the sites that are important for Elongator function. Phosphorylation appears to affect interaction of the Elongator complex both with its kinase (Hrr25) and with Kti12, an accessory protein previously implicated in Elongator function. Our studies imply that Elp1 phosphorylation plays a positive role in Elongator-mediated tRNA modification and raise the possibility that wobble uridine modification may be regulated, representing a potential translational control mechanism.
