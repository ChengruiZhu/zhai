Transposons, or mobile DNA sequences—first described by Barbara McClintock—are interesting and important residents of all genomes. They are involved in gene creation and regulation, chromosome evolution, and generation of mutations, events that can occur on hugely varying time scales, from millions of years to mere days in the lab. Some transposons have even been “tamed” by geneticists for use as tools for marking genes and making mutations. In yeast, genome sequencing has given us a snapshot of transposons present in one strain at one particular time. The authors developed a method to easily, accurately, and globally track transposons in order to study how their locations change in different strains or during an experiment. The method involves finding pieces of DNA that contain the ends of transposons along with neighboring DNA and attaching these segments to magnetic beads. A magnet is then used to separate the selected DNAs away from the rest of the genome. The transposon-associated DNA is labeled with dyes and applied to a microarray, a glass slide with over 40,000 unique sequence features of yeast DNA attached. Each feature that lights up with the dye marks a transposon location. This new technique allows investigators to easily identify specific strains, to accurately monitor mobile portions of the genome, and to determine the role of transposons in phenotypic differences.
