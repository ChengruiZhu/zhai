Tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive Na currents were examined in single dissociated ventricular myocytes from neonatal rats. Single channel and whole cell currents were measured using the patch-clamp method. The channel density was calculated as 2/micron 2, which agreed with our usual finding of four channels per membrane patch. At 20 degrees C, the single channel conductance was 20 pS. The open time distributions were fit by a single-exponential function with a mean open time of approximately 1.0 ms at membrane potentials from -60 to -40 mV. Averaged single channel and whole cell currents were similar when scaled and showed both fast and slow rates of inactivation. The inactivation and activation gating shifted quickly to hyperpolarized potentials for channels in cell-attached as well as excised patches, whereas a much slower shift occurred in whole cells. Slowly inactivating currents were present in both whole cell and single channel current measurements at potentials as positive as -40 mV. In whole cell measurements, the potential range could be extended, and slow inactivation was present at potentials as positive as -10 mV. The curves relating steady state activation and inactivation to membrane potential had very little overlap, and slow inactivation occurred at potentials that were positive to the overlap. Slow inactivation is in this way distinguishable from the overlap or window current, and the slowly inactivating current may contribute to the plateau of the rat cardiac action potential. On rare occasions, a second set of Na channels having a smaller unit conductance and briefer duration was observed. However, a separate set of threshold channels, as described by Gilly and Armstrong (1984. Nature [Lond.]. 309:448), was not found. For the commonly observed Na channels, the number of openings in some samples far exceeded the number of channels per patch and the latencies to first opening or waiting times were not sufficiently dispersed to account for the slowly inactivating currents: the slow inactivation was produced by channel reopening. A general model was developed to predict the number of openings in each sample. Models in which the number of openings per sample was due to a dispersion of waiting times combined with a rapid transition from an open to an absorbing inactivated state were unsatisfactory and a model that was more consistent with the results was identified.
