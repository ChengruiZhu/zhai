 The average branchial blood pressure in sand sharks was 32 mm. of mercury. The highest recorded in a resting animal was 43 mm. The average dorsal or systemic pressure was 23.3 mm.; highest 30 mm. The ratio of branchial to systemic pressure is about 3 to 2. The pressure in both systems keeps up well under trauma; but under experimental conditions, with or without manipulation of viscera, slowly falls after several hours. It rises with muscular effort, and a long rise usually follows stoppage of struggling. It rises when sodium carbonate is injected. The adrenalin curve resembles that in a mammal. Spontaneous rises and falls not attributable to the heart occur. Light in some animals increases blood pressure. It is suspected that these fishes have a vasomotor apparatus. The heart rate except after trauma is practically always the same as the respiration rate, and there is some reason for believing that the heart rate is determined by the respiration rate. When not in step with respiration, the heart is slower and often in a simple ratio with respiration. The heart is inhibited by all sorts of stimuli applied practically anywhere (except to the liver?). This effect is abolished by atropin. Respiration is faster in small animals and averages 24 per minute. Respiration slowly decreases in strength with little change in rate. Usually respiration ceases long before the heart stops.
