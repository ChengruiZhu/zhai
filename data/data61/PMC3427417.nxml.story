Despite evidence that long-term smoking is the leading risk factor for pancreatic malignancies, the underlying mechanism(s) for cigarette-smoke (CS)-induced pancreatic cancer (PC) pathogenesis has not been well-established. Our previous studies revealed an aberrant expression of the MUC4 mucin in PC as compared to the normal pancreas and its association with cancer progression and metastasis. Interestingly, here we explore a potential link between MUC4 expression and smoking-mediated PC pathogenesis and report that both cigarette-smoke-extract (CSE) and nicotine, which is the major component of CS, significantly up-regulates MUC4 in PC cells. This nicotine-mediated MUC4 overexpression was via α7 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) stimulation and subsequent activation of the JAK2/STAT3 downstream signaling cascade in cooperation with the MEK/ERK1/2 pathway; this effect was blocked by the α7nAChR antagonists, α-bungarotoxin and mecamylamine, and by specific siRNA-mediated STAT3 inhibition. Additionally, we demonstrated that nicotine-mediated MUC4 up-regulation promotes the PC cell migration through the activation of the downstream effectors such as HER2, c-Src and FAK; this effect was attenuated by shRNA-mediated MUC4 abrogation, further implying that these nicotine-mediated pathological effects on PC cells are MUC4 dependent. Furthermore, the
