Using cultured cells of the marine alga, Halicystis parvula, we measured the concentrations of 11 inorganic ions in the vacuolar sap and the electrical potential difference (PD) between the vacuole and the external solution. In normal cells under steady-state conditions a comparison of the electrochemical equilibrium (Nernst) potential for each ion with the PD of -82 mV (inside negative) indicates that Na+ and K+ are actively transported out of the vacuole whereas all anions are pumped into the cell. Although the [K+] in the vacuole is only 9 mM, the cytoplasmic [K+] is about 420 mM, which suggests that the outwardly directed pump is at the tonoplast. Using large Halicystis cells we perfused the vacuole with an artificial seawater and conducted a short- circuit analysis of ion transport. The short-circuit current (SCC) of 299 peq - cm-2-s-1 is not significantly different from the net influx of Cl-. There is a small, but statistically significant net efflux of K+ (less than 1 pmol-cm-2.-1), while the influx and efflux of Na+ are not significantly different. Therefore, the SCC is a good measure of the activity of the Cl- pump. Finally, we measured the volumetric elastic modulus (epsilon) of the cell wall by measuring the change in cell volume when the internal hydrostatic pressure was altered. The value of epsilon at applied pressures between 0 and 0.4 atm is about 0.6 atm, which is at least 100-fold lower than the values of epsilon for all other algae which have been studied.
