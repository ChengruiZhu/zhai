ClC-1 is a dimeric, double-pored chloride channel that is present in skeletal muscle. Mutations of this channel can result in the condition myotonia, a muscle disorder involving increased muscle stiffness. It has been shown that the dominant form of myotonia often results from mutations that affect the so-called slow, or common, gating process of the ClC-1 channel. Mutations causing dominant myotonia are seen to cluster at the interface of the ClC-1 channel monomers. This study has investigated the role of the H, I, P, and Q helices, which lie on this interface, as well as the G helix, which is situated immediately behind the H and I helices, on ClC-1 gating. 11 mutant ClC-1 channels (T268M, C277S, C278S, S289A, T310M, S312A, V321S, T539A, S541A, M559T, and S572V) were produced using site-directed mutagenesis, and gating properties of these channels were investigated using electrophysiological techniques. Six of the seven mutations in G, H, and I, and two of the four mutations in P and Q, caused shifts of the ClC-1 open probability. In the majority of cases this was due to alterations in the common gating process, with only three of the mutants displaying any change in fast gating. Many of the mutant channels also showed alterations in the kinetics of the common gating process, particularly at positive potentials. The changes observed in common gating were caused by changes in the opening rate (e.g. T310M), the closing rate (e.g. C277S), or both rates. These results indicate that mutations in the helices forming the dimer interface are able to alter the ClC-1 common gating process by changing the energy of the open and/or closed channel states, and hence altering transition rates between these states.
