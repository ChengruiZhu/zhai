Previous studies have shown that cytokinetic abscission at the end of mitosis is executed by the ESCRT machinery in mammalian cells, and that the process is dependent on adhesion-induced integrin signalling via a FAK-PLK1-CEP55-TSG101/Alix-CHMP4B pathway. The present study identified an alternative abscission mechanism driven by mechanical force. In the absence of integrin signals (non-adherent conditions), cytokinesis in non-transformed human fibroblasts proceeds to CEP55 accumulation at the midbody, but after prolonged time (>3 hours) the major midbody components Aurora B, MKLP1 and CEP55 were no longer detected in the area. Upon adhesion to fibronectin, such cells were able to complete abscission without re-appearance of midbody proteins. Live-cell imaging revealed that re-plating on stiff fibronectin matrix (64 KPa) allowed >95% of the cells to complete abscission within 9 hours while the corresponding number was 40% on soft fibronectin matrix (0.5 KPa). The cells re-plated on poly-L-lysine were not able to generate tension and did not divide. Thus, mechanical tension can cause cytokinetic abscission by stretching of the intercellular bridge between the two daughter cells until it eventually ruptures without the involvement of ESCRT complexes. Importantly, regression of the cleavage furrow and formation of bi-nucleated cells did not occur in most of the suspension-treated mitotic cells after re-plating on fibronectin. Septin, which stabilizes the membrane associated with the midbody, was found to remain along the ingressed membrane, suggesting that this filament system maintains the membrane bridge although the midbody had dissolved, thereby preventing regression and allowing tension to act on the narrow intercellular bridge.
