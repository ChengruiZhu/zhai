Body weight of klotho−/− mice was greater in linagliptin group than in control group (11.1 ± 0.3 vs 9.9 ± 0.3 g; P < 0.01), which was associated with greater gastrocnemius muscle weight (P < 0.01) and greater kidney weight (P < 0.05) in linagliptin group. Thus, linagliptin significantly prevented body weight loss in klotho−/− mice. Survival rate of klotho−/− mice was greater in linagliptin group (93%) compared to control group (67%), although the difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.08). None of linagliptin-treated klotho−/− mice had alopecia during the treatment (P < 0.05 vs control klotho−/− mice). Latency of klotho−/− mice in passive avoidance test was larger in linagliptin group than in control group (P < 0.05), indicating the amelioration of cognitive impairment by linagliptin. Cerebral blood flow of klotho−/− mice was larger in linagliptin group than in control group (P < 0.01), being associated with greater cerebral phospho-eNOS levels (P < 0.05) in linagliptin group. Neuronal cell number in hippocampal CA1 region was greater in linagliptin group than in control group (P < 0.05). Linagliptin group had greater cerebral phospho-Akt (P < 0.05) and phospho-CREB (P < 0.05) than control group. Thus, linagliptin ameliorated brain aging in klotho−/− mice. The degree of hypoglycemia in klotho−/− mice was less in linagliptin group than in control group, as estimated by the findings of OGTT.
