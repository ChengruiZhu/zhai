Abnormal cerebral blood flow (CBF) is reportedly associated with major depressive disorder (MDD). We have investigated CBF changes in early-onset depression (EOD) and late-onset depression (LOD), and their impact on cognitive function. Thirty-two remitted EOD patients, 32 remitted LOD patients, and 43 age-matched healthy controls were recruited, and the pulsed arterial spin labeling data were scanned under 3.0T MRI and processed through voxel-by-voxel statistical analysis. Compared to healthy controls, LOD patients had decreased normalized CBF in the bilateral precuneus, cuneus, right fronto-cingulate-striatal areas, and right temporal, occipital and parietal lobes, but increased normalized CBF in the left frontal and temporal cortices and the cingulate gyrus. EOD patients had decreased normalized CBF in the left cerebellum and right calcarine/lingual/fusiform gyrus, and increased normalized CBF in right angular gyrus. LOD patients displayed hemispheric asymmetry in CBF, and had more regions with abnormal CBF than EOD patients. A significant correlation between abnormal CBF and impaired cognitive function was detected in LOD patients, but not EOD patients. These results demonstrate greater CBF abnormalities in LOD patients than EOD patients, and suggest these CBF changes may be associated with progressive degradation of cognitive function in LOD patients.
