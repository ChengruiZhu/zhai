During development of the nervous system, axons are propelled by the growth cone, a motile structure that is specialized to detect the direction of concentration gradients of guidance cues. Although it is known that commissural axons—those that cross the midline from one side of the nervous system to the other—of the spinal cord are guided by multiple cues simultaneously, it is unclear whether they integrate multiple guidance cues and, if that is the case, the advantage of doing so. In the developing spinal cord, the gradients of the guidance cues are shallow and, thus, their direction is difficult to determine. We hypothesize that under these circumstances, a combination of cues could be used synergistically by the growth cone. To test this hypothesis, we built a microfluidic gradient generator capable of simulating the shallow gradients that growth cones encounter in the developing spinal cord. Using this guidance assay, we demonstrated that commissural axons are best at reorienting themselves in the steepest part of a gradient of Shh or Netrin, two guidance cues that these axons encounter in the spinal cord. We then challenged axons with combined gradients of both cues. At low gradient steepness, we observed synergy in their turning response and in the asymmetry of the shared downstream signaling molecules Src-family kinases (SFKs). We therefore propose a model in which SFKs integrate distinct signaling pathways, and we define this as steepness-limited synergy.
