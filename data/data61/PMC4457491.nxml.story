Life as we know it depends on interactions between proteins. There is substantial evidence that many interactions between proteins involve very flexible protein regions. These disordered regions may undergo disorder/order transitions upon forming an interaction with another protein. Many successful approaches to medicinal chemistry are based on mimicking the interactions of biological molecules with man-made small molecules. However how drug-like small-molecules may modulate protein disorder is currently poorly understood, largely because it is difficult to measure in details this type of interaction with experimental methods. Here we have used computer simulations to resolve with great details the process by which different small-molecules modulate the flexibility of a disordered region of the protein MDM2. This protein is overexpressed in many cancers and small-molecules that recognize MDM2 have been developed over the last decade as possible novel anti-cancer agents. We show that the flexible MDM2 “lid” region adopts different conformational states in the presence of different small-molecules. Our results suggest why some classes of small-molecules form favorable interactions with the lid region, whereas others do not. These findings may prove crucial to develop new and more effective MDM2 inhibitors, and more generally to help drug designers target disordered proteins regions with small-molecules.
