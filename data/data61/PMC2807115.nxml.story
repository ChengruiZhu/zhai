Entering into an integrated care program leads to legal challenges with regard to the actors. In particular, the question which duties are faced when entering into an integrated care program has not been raised yet. Therefore, patients find themselves in situations with a deficit of information and do not see the legal consequences when entering into an integrated care program. Patients often do not realise that they conclude an agreement with a health insurance company. They bind themselves for a certain period (sometimes several years) and they are contractually not allowed to rescind from the agreement. In general, integrated care programs offered from health insurance companies oblige the patient to consult the healthcare providers that are covered from the agreement. As a consequence, in case patients are not satisfied with the healthcare provider because of medical or personal reasons, no change to another healthcare provider is possible. Further, patients always enter into an implied health treatment agreement with the healthcare provider. In turn, healthcare providers do not have any certainties to be appointed from health insurance companies and, therefore, may lose essential revenues. In addition, healthcare providers are obliged to fulfil certain requirements (technical and organisational) in order to be appointed. In case they are not able anymore to continuously fulfil these requirements, health insurance companies may rescind their contracts. Having these issues in mind, one can assume that entering into an integrated care program implies various—often unseen—duties from different perspectives.
