The femoral artery was successfully punctured in all but one patient, with that patient undergoing a carotid artery puncture. The systolic peak pressure gradient (PG) across the coarctation was 41.0 ± 16.0 mmHg (range 13–76 mmHg). The mean diameter of the narrowest coarctation site was 1.7 ± 0.6 mm (range 0.5–2.8 mm). All patients had successful dilation; the PG significantly decreased to 13.0 ± 11.0 mmHg (range 0–40 mmHg), and the diameter of coarctation significantly improved to 3.8 ± 0.9 mm (range 2.5–5.3 mm). No intraoperative complications occurred for any patients. However, in one case that underwent a carotid artery puncture, a giant aneurysm formed at the puncture site and required surgical repair. The following observations were made during the follow-up period from 6-month to 7-year: (1) The PG across the coarctation measured by echocardiography further decreased or remained stable in 31 cases. The remaining six patients, whose PGs gradually increased, required a second dilation. No patient required further surgery because of a CoA; (2) in two cases, an aortic aneurysm was found with an angiogram performed immediately postdilatation and disappeared at 18 and 12 months of age, respectively; (3) tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension improved in all patients; (4) all patients were doing well and were asymptomatic.
