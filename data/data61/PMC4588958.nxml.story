Over the last ten years there has been a resurgent interest in the use of coracoid transfer procedures for the treatment of traumatic, anterior glenohumeral instability of the shoulder. Bankart repair, whether arthroscopic or open, is the gold standard for treatment of the majority of anterior glenohumeral instability cases. Coracoid transfer procedures, on the other hand, are effective for patients with significant bony defects, those with poor quality anterior capsulolabral tissues, and in collision athletes with higher risk of instability after simple soft-tissue repair. Despite high rates of success in most studies involving the Bristow and other coracoid transfer procedures, complications have been reported. Screw breakage, nerve injury, non-union of the coracoid fragment, and arthritis related to improper placement of the bone block have all been documented. Eliminating the bone block would help to decrease the number of potential complications associated with the procedure. For this reason, we sought to evaluate whether the Bristow procedure or the conjoined tendon transfer (CTT) would be more effective in restoring kinematics of the glenohumeral joint in a glenoid bone loss model for anterior shoulder instability. This is the first study to our knowledge comparing a bone block with its attached musculotendinous sling to a sling alone in a glenoid bone loss model.
