 133:169–184), ectopic expression of the α5 integrin in cultures of primary quail myoblasts promotes a striking contact-mediated inhibition of cell migration. Myoblasts ectopically expressing α5 integrin (α5 myoblasts) move normally when not in contact, but upon contact, they show inhibition of migration and motile activity (i.e., extension and retraction of membrane protrusions). As a consequence, these cells tend to grow in aggregates and do not migrate to close a wound. This phenotype is also seen with ectopic expression of β1 integrin, paxillin, or activated FAK (CD2 FAK) and therefore appears to result from enhanced integrin-mediated signaling. The contact inhibition observed in the α5 myoblasts is mediated by N-cadherin, whose expression is upregulated more than fivefold. Perturbation studies using low calcium conditions, antibody inhibition, and ectopic expression of wild-type and mutant N-cadherins all implicate N-cadherin in the contact inhibition of migration. Ectopic expression of N-cadherin also produces cells that show inhibited migration upon contact; however, they do not show suppressed motile activity, suggesting that integrins and cadherins coordinately regulate motile activity. These observations have potential importance to normal and pathologic processes during embryonic development and tumor metastasis.
