EphA2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that triggers keratinocyte differentiation upon activation and subsequently down-regulation by ephrin-A1 ligand. The objective for this study was to determine if the EphA2/ephrin-A1 signaling axis was altered in psoriasis, an inflammatory skin condition where keratinocyte differentiation is abnormal. Microarray analysis of skin biopsies from psoriasis patients revealed increased mRNA transcripts for several members of this RTK family in plaques, including the EphA1, EphA2 and EphA4 subtypes prominently expressed by keratinocytes. Of these, EphA2 showed the greatest up-regulation, a finding that was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR, IHC analysis and ELISA. In contrast, psoriatic lesions exhibited reduced ephrin-A ligand immunoreactivity. Exposure of primary keratinocytes induced to differentiated in high calcium or a 3-dimensiosnal raft culture of human epidermis to a combination of growth factors and cytokines elevated in psoriasis increased EphA2 mRNA and protein expression while inducing S100A7 and disrupting differentiation. Pharmacological delivery of a soluble ephrin-A1 peptidomimetic ligand led to a reduction in EphA2 expression and ameliorated proliferation and differentiation in raft cultures exposed to EGF and IL-1Î±. These findings suggest that ephrin-A1-mediated down-regulation of EphA2 supports keratinocyte differentiation in the context of cytokine perturbation.
