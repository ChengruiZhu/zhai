In the atmospheric scanning electron microscope (ASEM), a 2- to 3-Î¼m layer of the sample resting on a silicon nitride-film window in the base of an open sample dish is imaged, in liquid, at atmospheric pressure, from below by an inverted SEM. Thus, the time-consuming pretreatments generally required for biological samples to withstand the vacuum of a standard electron microscope are avoided. In the present study, various mouse tissues (brain, spinal cord, muscle, heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen and stomach) were fixed, stained with heavy metals, and visualized in radical scavenger D-glucose solution using the ASEM. While some stains made the nuclei of cells very prominent (platinum-blue, phosphotungstic acid), others also emphasized cell organelles and membranous structures (uranium acetate or the NCMIR method). Notably, symbiotic bacteria were sometimes observed on stomach mucosa. Furthermore, kidney tissue could be stained and successfully imaged in <30 min. Lung and spinal cord tissue from normal mice and mice metastasized with breast cancer cells was also examined. Cancer cells present in lung alveoli and in parts of the spine tissue clearly had larger nuclei than normal cells. The results indicate that the ASEM has the potential to accelerate intraoperative cancer diagnosis, the diagnosis of kidney diseases and pathogen detection. Importantly, in the course of the present study it was possible to increase the observable tissue area by using a new multi-windowed ASEM sample dish and sliding the tissue across its eight windows.
