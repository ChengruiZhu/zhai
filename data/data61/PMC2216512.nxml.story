The fusion of individual influenza virions with a planar phospholipid membrane was detected by fluorescence video microscopy. Virion envelopes were loaded with the lipophilic fluorescent marker octadecylrhodamine B (R18) to a density at which the fluorescence of the probe was self-quenched. Labeled virions were ejected toward the planar membrane from a micropipette in a custom-built video fluorescence microscope. Once a virion fused with the planar membrane, the marker was free to diffuse, and its fluorescence became dequenched, producing a flash of light. This flash was detected as a transient spot of light which increased and then diminished in brightness. The diffusion constants calculated from the brightness profiles for the flashes are consistent with fusion of virus to the membrane with consequent free diffusion of probe within the planar membrane. Under conditions known to be fusigenic for influenza virus (low pH and 37 degrees C), flashes appeared at a high rate and the planar membrane quickly became fluorescent. To further establish that these flashes were due to fusion, we showed that red blood cells, which normally do not attach to planar membranes, were able to bind to membranes that had been exposed to virus under fusigenic conditions. The amount of binding correlated with the amount of flashing. This indicates that flashes signaled the reconstitution of the hemagglutinin glycoprotein (HA) of influenza virus, a well-known erythrocyte receptor, into the planar membrane, as would be expected in a fusion process. The flash rate on ganglioside-containing asolectin membranes increased as the pH was lowered. This is also consistent with the known fusion behavior of influenza virus with cell membranes and with phospholipid vesicles. We conclude that the flashes result from the fusion of individual virions to the planar membrane.
