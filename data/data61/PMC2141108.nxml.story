 1. The respiration of the reticulocytes of the rabbit has been measured during the period of an anemia produced by phenylhydrazine. Though the respiration increased greatly during the phase of regeneration, the oxygen consumption per billion reticulocytes throughout the period remained approximately the same. 2. The respiration of the reticulocytes was affected by changes in the reaction of the medium in which they were suspended, and was at its maximum about a pH of 8, with a probable intracorpuscular pH of about 7.75. 3. Variations in the tonicity of the suspending medium did not produce any great change in the respiration of the reticulocytes. 4. The presence of glycine, alanine, and glucose in the suspending medium resulted in no acceleration in the respiration of the cells. At higher concentrations glucose tended to depress the respiration. The material oxidized appears to be mainly or entirely contained in the corpuscles at the time they are liberated from the marrow. 5. A comparison is made of the respiration of the reticulated nucleated red cells present in the blood of anemic fowls and the non-nucleated reticulated red cells of rabbits. On the basis of equal volumes of cells, the respiration of the former is about twice that of the latter, while this in turn is about six times as great as the nucleated but non-reticulated normal red cells of the fowl.
