The present study explored the effects of disodium cantharidinate (DC) on the peripheral blood-derived dendritic cells of patients with bladder carcinoma. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the 15 cases of urinary bladder carcinoma of middle and advanced stage were separated, and dendritic cells were prepared. The morphological changes of dendritic cells were observed. Flow cytometry was used to detect the expression levels of CD1a and CD83 on dendritic cell surface. MTT assay was utilized to measure the proliferation ability of allogeneic lymphocyte stimulated by DC. Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide (PI) double staining flow cytometry method was carried out to detect cell apoptosis after treatment with DC. The changes in caspase-3 and PARP expression levels were investigated by western blot method. The high-dose DC resulted in a significant increase in the expressions of dendritic cell phenotyptic molecules CDla and CD83 as compared to control group. In addition, the proliferation index of allogenic lymphocyte stimulated by DC was significantly higher than that of control group. Moreover, MTT assay showed significant inhibition of the growth of BIU-87 cells. After 24 h of DC treatment, double staining flow cytometry confirmed the ability of DC to induce cell apoptosis. Further, western blot method showed a significant elevation of caspase-3 and PARP protein expression after DC treatment. In conclusion, DC treatment could induce dendritic cell maturation of patient with carcinoma of urinary bladder and promote its functional changes. Furthermore, DC was able to inhibit the proliferation of cell BIU-87 and also has the ability to induce cell apoptosis.
