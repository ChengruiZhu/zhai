A population‐based study of patients aged 66 years and older who underwent elective (n=87 257) or urgent (n=35 930) noncardiac surgery in Ontario, Canada (April 2012 to March 2015) was performed. Outcomes were compared between AF groups using inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score. Of 4612 urgent surgical patients with AF, treatments before surgery included warfarin (n=1619), a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) (n=729), and no anticoagulation (n=2264). After urgent surgery, the death rate within 30 days was significantly higher in patients with AF compared with patients with no AF (hazard ratio [HR], 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12–1.45). In contrast, among 4769 elective surgical patients with AF treated with warfarin (n=1453), a DOAC (n=1165), or no anticoagulation (n=2151), prior AF was not associated with higher mortality. Comparing patients with AF who were or were not anticoagulated, there was no difference in 30‐day mortality after urgent (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.79–1.14) or elective (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.38–1.09) surgery. There was no difference in 30‐day mortality between patients with AF treated with a DOAC or warfarin after urgent (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.70–1.18) or elective (HR, 1.64; 95% CI, 0.77–3.53) surgery. Bleeding and thromboembolic rates did not differ significantly among patients with AF prescribed a DOAC or warfarin.
