The finding that the relative single-dose efficacy of oral cholera vaccination is above the estimated MRSE suggests that one-dose reactive vaccination campaigns might avert more cases and deaths than a standard two-dose campaign when vaccine supplies are limited. The accuracy of this and other study findings is limited, however, by the assumptions used to build the mathematical models and by the quality of the data used to run them. In particular, a lack of data on the efficacy of single-dose vaccination limits the ability to apply these findings. Thus, before one-dose campaigns are used widely, more data on the effectiveness on one-dose vaccination must be obtained. Notably, by increasing herd immunity (the vaccination of a significant portion of a population provides some protection for individuals in the population who have not been vaccinated), one-dose campaigns are likely to provide better population-level protection than two-dose campaigns. On the other hand, the individual who is given one rather than two vaccine doses is more vulnerable to cholera illness if exposed to cholera-causing bacteria. Strategies that balance the trade-off between individual- and population-level benefits must be carefully considered to ensure the best future use of the oral cholera vaccine stockpile. Moreover, every effort should be made to increase the size and availability of this stockpile.
