Adhesion receptors, which connect cells to each other and to the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), play a crucial role in the control of tissue structure and of morphogenesis. In this work, we have studied how intercellular adhesion molecules and β1 integrins influence each other using two different β1-null cell lines, epithelial GE11 and fibroblast-like GD25 cells. Expression of β1A or the cytoplasmic splice variant β1D, induced the disruption of intercellular adherens junctions and cell scattering in both GE11 and GD25 cells. In GE11 cells, the morphological change correlated with the redistribution of zonula occluden (ZO)-1 from tight junctions to adherens junctions at high cell confluency. In addition, the expression of β1 integrins caused a dramatic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and of focal contacts. Interaction of β1 integrins with their respective ligands was required for a complete morphological transition towards the spindle-shaped fibroblast-like phenotype. The expression of an interleukin-2 receptor (IL2R)-β1A chimera and its incorporation into focal adhesions also induced the disruption of cadherin-based adhesions and the reorganization of ECM–cell contacts, but failed to promote cell migration on fibronectin, in contrast to full-length β1A. This indicates that the disruption of cell–cell adhesion is not simply the consequence of the stimulated cell migration. Expression of β1 integrins in GE11 cells resulted in a decrease in cadherin and α-catenin protein levels accompanied by their redistribution from the cytoskeleton-associated fraction to the detergent-soluble fraction. Regulation of α-catenin protein levels by β1 integrins is likely to play a role in the morphological transition, since overexpression of α-catenin in GE11 cells before β1 prevented the disruption of intercellular adhesions and cell scattering. In addition, using biochemical activity assays for Rho-like GTPases, we show that the expression of β1A, β1D, or IL2R-β1A in GE11 or GD25 cells triggers activation of both RhoA and Rac1, but not of Cdc42. Moreover, dominant negative Rac1 (N17Rac1) inhibited the disruption of cell–cell adhesions when expressed before β1. However, all three GTPases might be involved in the morphological transition, since expression of either N19RhoA, N17Rac1, or N17Cdc42 reversed cell scattering and partially restored cadherin-based adhesions in GE11-β1A cells. Our results indicate that β1 integrins regulate the polarity and motility of epithelial cells by the induction of intracellular molecular events involving a downregulation of α-catenin function and the activation of the Rho-like G proteins Rac1 and RhoA.
