Gastrinomas are functionally active pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) secreting gastrin and are associated with local or regional metastases in 60% of the cases. Somatostatin analogs (SSAs) are currently recommended as a first-line treatment for the symptomatic treatment of NETs. Although antiproliferative activity of SSAs has been demonstrated in various cancer types in several in vivo and in vitro studies, clinical benefits with SSAs have been only achieved in a small proportion of patients. We report a disease control on a long-acting SSA lanreotide in a patient with metastatic gastrinoma. A 60-year-old man, who had previously undergone a surgical resection of metastatic pancreatic gastrinoma, presented with abdominal bloating, edema in the lower limbs, fatigue, and weight loss. The gastrinoma relapse with additional metastases in the pancreas, duodenum, and liver was confirmed by positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan; the patient's blood gastrin level was >5,000 ng/L. Treatment with the SSA octreotide long-acting release was initiated to treat the gastrinoma relapse. On the CT scan done in September 2011, the liver metastases were still identifiable. In December 2011, the treatment was switched to lanreotide Autogel® (120 mg every 2 weeks). Following the treatment, the gastrin levels were reduced to <1,200 ng/L in September 2013, and 812 ng/L in July 2016. Since November 2012, the gastrinoma lesions were no longer visible in abdominal CT. At the time of this report, the patient's gastrinoma was under control with lanreotide Autogel®. This case report supports the use of lanreotide Autogel® as effective treatment for metastatic gastrinoma.
