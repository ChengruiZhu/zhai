Bronchopleural fistulas can occur as a rare but severe complication after pulmonary resection. Established guidelines for the proper treatment of patients with bronchopleural fistulas do not exist. Apart from attempts to close the fistula, emphasis is placed on preventive measures, early treatment with antibiotics, drainage of the empyema and aggressive nutritional and rehabilitative support. For inoperable patients, endoscopic procedures are the only therapeutic option. Unfortunately, large (>8 mm) or central bronchopleural fistulas are usually not suitable for such endoscopic management. Recently, some groups have published a few case reports about a novel technique for the endobronchial closure of bronchopleural fistulas, using an Amplatzer device, originally designed for transcatheter closure of cardiac septal defects. We applied the same technique as a life-saving treatment in a ventilated patient who was considered inoperable due to a high oxygen need. The operation was successful. The patient could be weaned from ventilation and was eventually discharged from the hospital to a rehabilitation facility several weeks after the insertion of the device. Until now, endoscopic techniques have only been useful for the treatment of small, peripheral, bronchopleural fistulas and even then only as a bridge to surgery in high-risk surgical patients. In this case report, we demonstrate that the use of an Amplatzer device can expand the importance of endoscopic techniques in the treatment of bronchopleural fistulas. An Amplatzer device, for endobronchial closure, can indeed be administered for large and central bronchopleural fistulas. Moreover, it can be considered as a definite alternative to surgery in inoperable patients.
