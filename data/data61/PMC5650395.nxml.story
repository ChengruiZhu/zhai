Therapies that target cancer cells may have unexpected effects on the tumor microenvironment that affects therapy outcomes or render therapy resistance. Prostate cancer (PCa) bone metastasis is uniquely associated with osteoblastic bone lesions and treatment with cabozantinib, a VEGFR-2 and MET inhibitor, leads to a reduction in number and/or intensity of lesions on bone scans. However, resistance to cabozantinib therapy inevitably occurs. We examined the effect of cabozantinib on osteoblast differentiation and secretion in the context of therapy resistance. We showed that primary mouse osteoblasts express VEGFR2 and MET and cabozantinib treatment decreased osteoblast proliferation but enhanced their differentiation. A genome-wide analysis of transcriptional responses of osteoblasts to cabozantinib identified a set of genes accounting for inhibition of proliferation and stimulation of differentiation, and a spectrum of secreted proteins induced by cabozantinib, including pappalysin, IGFBP2, WNT 16, and DKK1. We determined that these proteins were upregulated in the conditioned medium of cabozantinib-treated osteoblasts (CBZ-CM) compared to control CM. Treatment of C4-2B4 or PC3-mm2 PCa cells with CBZ-CM increased the anchorage-independent growth and migration of these PCa cells compared to cells treated with control CM. These results suggest that the effect of cabozantinib on the tumor microenvironment may increase tumor cell survival and cause therapy resistance.
