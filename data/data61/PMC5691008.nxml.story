The purpose of this study was to show that the nominal peak tube voltage potential (kVp) and measured half‐value layer (HVL) can be used to generate energy spectra and fluence profiles for characterizing a computed tomography (CT) X‐ray source, and to validate the source model and an in‐house kV X‐ray dose computation algorithm (kVDoseCalc) for computing machine‐ and patient‐specific CT dose. Spatial variation of the X‐ray source spectra of a Philips Brilliance and a GE Optima Big Bore CT scanner were found by measuring the HVL along the direction of the internal bow‐tie filter axes. Third‐party software, Spektr, and the nominal kVp settings were used to generate the energy spectra. Beam fluence was calculated by dividing the integral product of the spectra and the in‐air NIST mass‐energy attenuation coefficients by in‐air dose measurements along the filter axis. The authors found the optimal number of photons to seed in kVDoseCalc to achieve dose convergence. The Philips Brilliance beams were modeled for 90, 120, and 140 kVp tube settings. The GE Optima beams were modeled for 80, 100, 120, and 140 kVp tube settings. Relative doses measured using a Capintec Farmer‐type ionization chamber (0.65 cc) placed in a cylindrical polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) phantom and irradiated by the Philips Brilliance, were compared to those computed with kVDoseCalc. Relative doses in an anthropomorphic thorax phantom (E2E SBRT Phantom) irradiated by the GE Optima were measured using a (0.015 cc) PTW Freiburg ionization chamber and compared to computations from kVDoseCalc. The number of photons required to reduce the average statistical uncertainty in dose to
