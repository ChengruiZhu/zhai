Enhancers are regulatory elements that interact with transcription factor proteins to control cell-specific gene expression during development. Surprisingly, only a subset of enhancers are highly conserved at the sequence level, even though the expression patterns they control are often conserved and essential for proper development. Why some enhancer sequences are highly conserved whereas others are not is not well understood. In this study, we characterize a highly conserved enhancer that regulates gene expression in leg precursor cells. We find that this enhancer has dual regulatory activities that include gene activation in thoracic segments and gene repression in abdominal segments. Surprisingly, we show that the conserved enhancer can tolerate numerous sequence changes yet mediate robust transcription factor binding and abdominal repression. These findings are consistent with abdominal transcription factors binding numerous different configurations of binding sites. So, why is this enhancer highly conserved? We found that overlapping sequences within the enhancer also contribute to thoracic activation, suggesting the enhancer sequences are under added functional constraints. Altogether, our results provide new insights into why some enhancers are highly conserved at the sequence level while others can tolerate sequence changes.
