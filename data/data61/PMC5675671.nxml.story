Recently, a growing number of studies have indicated that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as new critical regulators of tumorigenesis and prognostic markers in multiple cancers. However, the expression pattern of lncRNAs and their contributions in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains poorly understood. In this study, we performed a genome-wide comprehensively analysis of lncRNAs profiling and clinical relevance to provide valuable lncRNA candidates for the further study in RCC. RCC and non-tumor tissues RNA sequencing data, and microarray data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), then, these data were annotated and analyzed to find dysregulated lncRNAs in RCC. We identified that hundreds of lncRNAs were differentially expressed in RCC tissues compared with normal tissues, and genomic variation analyses revealed that copy number amplification or deletion happened in some of these lncRNAs genome loci. Moreover, lots of lncRNAs expression levels are significantly associated RCC patients overall survival time, such as PVT1 and DUXAP8. Finally, we identified some novel metastasis associated lncRNAs in RCC (such as DUXAP8) by analyzing lncRNAs profiling in the RCC tissues from patients with metastasis compared with the primary RCC tissues without metastasis; knockdown of DUXAP8 could impair RCC cells invasive ability
