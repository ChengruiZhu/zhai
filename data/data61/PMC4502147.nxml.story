The objective of the present work is to design sustained release matrix tablets of cefixime trihydrate by incorporating drug in a matrix made up of release retardant polymers, which prolong drug release leading to minimization of the peak and valley effect in the plasma and provide patient convenience. The effect of combination of polymers on parameters like release pattern, release mechanism of the drug were studied. Total nine formulations each containing 200 mg of drug were prepared by direct compression method. The formulations F-1, F-2, F-3 were prepared with a 1:1 drug to polymer ratio using hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose sodium and ethyl cellulose. F-4 was prepared with a 1:1 ratio of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose sodium, F-5 as prepared with a 1:1 ratio of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and ethyl cellulose, F-6 was prepared with a 1:1 ratio of carboxymethyl cellulose sodium and ethyl cellulose, F-7, F-8, F-9 were prepared by using polymers hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose sodium and ethyl cellulose in the ratios of 0.5:0.5:1, 0.5:1:0.5, and 1:0.5:0.5. Designed matrix tablets were evaluated for various pre-compression and post-compression parameters. Formulation F-5 showed 102.15 % release at the end of 12 h and it is selected as the best formulation. All Formulations followed zero order with non-Fickian diffusion method.
