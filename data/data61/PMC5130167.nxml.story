The architecture of vascular networks must balance complex demands to efficiently deliver oxygen and resources throughout the entire body. These demands constrain the possible forms of vasculature. Because of these constraints and the indispensable role of vasculature for much of life, scientists have sought to identify systematic patterns in the structural properties of vascular networks and whether these patterns can be predicted from models based on biological and physical principles. These studies have been limited by the lack of extensive, detailed data. Using high-quality vascular network data obtained via our software, Angicart, we identify novel, systematic patterns of asymmetry in sizes and branching angles among sibling vessels from mouse lung and human head and torso. To examine what constraints might underlie these patterns, we investigate several explanations, including various types of optimal branching as well as random branching. The optimal branchings were derived locally with respect to constraints on material costs or power loss. For random branching we allowed the degree of randomness to vary from local to global spatial scales. By comparing predictions with real data, our study suggests that a key component in determining vascular branching is material cost with some randomness at local to intermediate spatial scales.
