 taken from logarithmically growing cultures and resuspended in a dilute salt solution were followed in the presence of several pharmacologic agents. Serotonin, caffeine, and, to a lesser extent, dibutyryl cyclic AMP increased the rate of particle ingestion, but did not alter the rate of release of the three acid hydrolases studied. Added catecholamines did not affect either particle ingestion or acid hydrolase release, but particle ingestion was inhibited by the catecholamine antagonists, dichloroisoproterenol, desmethylimipramine, reserpine, and phenoxybenzamine. These drugs also increased the release of acid phosphatase and ribonuclease in 5-h incubations. Desmethylimipramine acted within 1 h to increase acid hydrolase release, but the effect of dichloroisoproterenol developed more slowly and was secondary to a change in cellular content of the hydrolases. Desmethylimipramine increased the energy of activation for the release of acid phosphatase, while dichloroisoproterenol did not. Both of these drugs enhanced the egestion of preingested dimethylbenzanthracene particles, supporting the view that acid hydrolase release occurs through a cytoproct egestion mechanism. Particle ingestion was also inhibited by colchicine, vinblastine, and cytochalasin B, but these agents had no effect on acid hydrolase release, thus further differentiating the properties of the ingestion mechanism from those of the egestion mechanism. It appears that both microtubules and microfilaments play a role in the ingestion process and that this process may be controlled in part by a cyclic AMP-mediated serotoninergic and adrenergic system.
