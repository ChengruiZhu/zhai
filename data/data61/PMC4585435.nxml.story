Differentially expressed genes are thought to regulate the development and progression of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC). The purpose of this study was to screen differentially expressed mRNAs in OSCC and matched paraneoplastic normal tissues, and to explore the intrinsic mechanism of OSCC development and progression. We obtained the differentially expressed mRNA expression profiles in 10 pairs of fresh-frozen OSCC tissue specimens and matched paraneoplastic normal tissue specimens by high-throughput RNA sequencing. By using Gene Ontology enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses, the functional significance of the differentially expressed genes were analyzed. We identified 1,120 significantly up-regulated mRNAs and 178 significantly down-regulated mRNAs in OSCC, compared to normal tissue. The differentially expressed mRNAs were involved in 20 biological processes and 68 signal pathways. Compared to adjacent normal tissue, the expression of MAGEA11 was up-regulated; TCHH was down-regulated. These findings were verified by real-time PCR. These differentially expressed mRNAs may function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in the development and progression of OSCC. This study provides novel insights into OSCC. However, further work is needed to determine if these differentially expressed mRNAs have potential roles as diagnostic biomarkers and candidate therapeutic targets for OSCC.
