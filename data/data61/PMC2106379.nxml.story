 The size, number, and location of lysosomes, phagosomes, and phago-lysosomes in different segments of the proximal and distal tubules, in the collecting tubules, and in invading macrophages of the kidneys of rats were compared by staining lysosomes (acid phosphatase) red, and phagosomes (injected horseradish peroxidase) blue in separate sections, and by staining phago-lysosomes purple by successive application of the reactions for the two enzymes in the same sections. It was concluded from these observations that the absorption of the foreign protein from the lumen and its gradual digestion in large phago-lysosomes took place mainly in the cells of the proximal convoluted tubules of the outer cortex. Several segments of the proximal convoluted tubules were distinguished on the basis of differences in the size and location of the phago-lysosomes and the amounts of peroxidase ingested. The distal tubules showed, in addition to moderate numbers of phago-lysosomes, many small phagosomes in the apical and basal zones of the cells. Moderate numbers of phagosomes and phago-lysosomes were observed in the cells of the collecting tubules. Macrophages showing very large phago-lysosomes were seen in the peritubular capillaries of the medulla, after injection of peroxidase. When high doses of peroxidase were administered, enlarged phago-lysosomes, parts of which seemed to be extruded into the lumen, were formed in the terminal segments of the proximal convoluted tubules.
