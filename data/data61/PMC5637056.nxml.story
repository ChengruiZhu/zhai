The α-Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone (αMSH)/Melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) interaction promotes melanogenesis through the cAMP/PKA pathway. The direct induction of this pathway by Forskolin (FSK) is also known to enhance melanocyte proliferation. αMSH acts as a mitogenic agent in melanocytes and its effect on proliferation of melanoma cells is less known. We previously identified the αMSH/Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor (PPARγ) pathway as a new pathway on the B16-F10 mouse melanoma cell line. αMSH induced the translocation of PPARγ into the nucleus as an active transcription factor. This effect was independent of the cAMP/PKA pathway and was mediated by the activation of the PI(4,5)P2/PLC pathway, a pathway which we have described to be triggered by the αMSH-dependent MC1R stimulation. Moreover, in the same study, preliminary experiments showed that mouse melanoma cells responded to αMSH by reducing proliferation and that PPARγ was involved in this effect. Due to its key role in the control of cell proliferation, PPARγ agonists are used in therapeutic models for different forms of cancer, including melanoma. The purpose of this study was: (a) to confirm the different proliferative behavior in response to αMSH in healthy and in melanoma condition; (b) to verify whether the cAMP/PKA pathway and the PLC/PPARγ pathway could exert an antagonistic function in the control of proliferation; (c) to deepen the knowledge of the molecular basis responsible for the down-proliferative response of melanoma cells after exposure to αMSH.
