Anesthetics make patients lose consciousness, but how they affect brain dynamics is still unknown. Changes in EEG brainwaves are some of the few noninvasive signals we can use to learn about this. By analyzing such data, we can develop more targeted anesthetics, expand our knowledge of sleep circuits, and better understand how diseases impact these systems. The anesthetic propofol is known, among other effects, to increase synaptic inhibition, but it is unclear how these changes induce EEG alpha (8–12 Hz) oscillations and their interaction with slow wave (0.1–1.5 Hz) oscillations; these signals have been correlated with the state of propofol-infused consciousness. We simulated a network of thalamic cells to understand the mechanisms generating these signals. Propofol-potentiated inhibition produced a novel, sustained alpha rhythm in our network. Changes to the tonic level of depolarization enabled the alpha oscillations to occur at different phases in the slow wave oscillation, as seen clinically with increasing propofol dose. The thalamus may be critical to propofol-induced alpha oscillations and their coupling to slow wave oscillations. By understanding the mechanisms generating alpha, we may be able to design experiments to dissociate alpha from slow waves and determine their independent effects on levels of consciousness.
