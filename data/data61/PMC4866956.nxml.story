MicroRNA-130b (miR-130b) is a novel tumor-related miRNA that has been found to be involved in several biological processes. However, there is limited evidence regarding the role of miR-130b in the tumorigenesis of human gliomas. In the present study, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays were used to quantify miR-130b expression levels in human glioma tissues and glioma cell lines (U251, U87, SNB19 and LN229). The expression level of miR-130b was found to be markedly higher in human glioma tissues than in non-neoplastic brain specimens. Specifically, higher expression levels of miR-130b were observed in the glioma cell lines, compared with those in normal human astrocytes (NHA). We also confirmed that miR-130b interacted with the 3′-untranslated region of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), which negatively affected the protein levels of E-cadherin. Furthermore, its effects on cell proliferation and invasion were examined using CCK8, colony formation, cell cycle and Transwell assays. We found that the upregulation of miR-130b induced cell proliferation, decreased the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase and enhanced the invasiveness of U251 glioma cells whereas the downregulation of miR-130b exerted opposing effects. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the downregulation of miR-130b in U251 glioma cells restored the expression of PPAR-γ and E-cadherin, and inhibited the expression of β-catenin. Notably, PPAR-γ knockdown abolished the inhibitory effect of miR-130b inhibitor on the proliferation and invasivness of U251 cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that miR-130b promotes the proliferation and invasion of U251 glioma cells by inhibiting PPAR-γ.
