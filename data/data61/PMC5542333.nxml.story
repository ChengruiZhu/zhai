Twelve human cadaveric knees were subject to a static anteriorly-directed force and moments in varus, valgus, internal and external rotation at the tibia while the femur was held stationary in order to quantify laxity at 0, 30, 60, and 90 degrees of flexion. Testing was performed on each leg in following ligament conditions: (1) ACL-intact/MCL-intact, (2) ACL-deficient/MCL-intact, (3) ACL-deficient/ MCL-partial injury, and (4) ACL-reconstruction, MCL-partial injury (chart 1). To quantify the effect of muscle loads the quadriceps, semimembranosus, biceps femoris, sartorius (Sr), St and G muscles were sutured and physiologically loaded. Quadriceps were loaded to 200 N and semimembranosus and biceps femoris were loaded to 40 N and held constant for all test conditions. The G and St were attached to a 40N load which was removed during test conditions in order to simulate hamstring graft harvest. Similarly, a Sr load of 20N was added and removed to determine its role in contributing to knee stability. For each ligament condition, the response to loading was determined with either (A) St/G muscles loaded and Sr unloaded; (B) St/G loaded, Sr loaded; (C) St/G unloaded, Sr unloaded; and (D) St/G unloaded, Sr loaded (chart 1). Three-dimensional positional data of the tibia relative to the femur was recorded to determine displacement and rotation across the knee.
