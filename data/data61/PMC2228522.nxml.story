The affinity and number of binding sites of [3H]ouabain to isolated transverse (T) tubules were determined in the absence and presence of deoxycholate. In both conditions the KD was approximately 53 nM while deoxycholate increased the number of binding sites from 3.5 to 37 pmol/mg protein. We concluded that the ouabain binding sites were located primarily on the inside of the isolated vesicle and that the vesicles were impermeable to ouabain. ATP induced a highly active Na+ accumulation by the T tubules which increased Na+ in the T tubular lumen by almost 200 nmol/mg protein. The accumulation had an initial fast phase lasting 2-3 min and a subsequent slow phase which continued for at least 40 min. The rate of the initial fast phase indicated a turnover number of 20 Na+/s. The Na+ accumulation was prevented by monensin but was unaffected by valinomycin. Ouabain did not influence Na+ uptake, but digitoxin inhibited it. At low K+ the accumulation of Na+ was reduced 3.7-fold below the value at 50 mM K+. 86Rb, employed as a tracer to detect K+, showed a first phase of K+ release while Na+ was accumulated. After 2-3 min, K+ was reaccumulated while Na+ continued to increase in the lumen. T tubules accumulated Cl- on addition of ATP. This suggested that ATP initiated an exchange of Na+ for K+ followed by uptake of Na+ and K+ accompanied by Cl-.
