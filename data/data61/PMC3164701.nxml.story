Gene translation is a central process in all living organisms. However, this process is still enigmatic, and contradicting conclusions regarding the essential parameters that determine translation rates appear in different studies. We introduce a new approach for modeling the process of translation elongation. Taking into account the stochastic nature of the translation process and the excluded volume interactions between ribosomes, our model is aimed at capturing the effect of codon order and composition on translation rates. We demonstrate that in comparison to commonly used approaches, our approach gives more accurate predictions of translation rates, protein abundance levels and ribosome densities across many species. Using our model, we address the need for a better understanding of the inner workings of the translation process. To this end, we analyze large scale genomic measurements made in several organisms. Our analysis unravels several central and previously uncharacterized aspects of the translation process. For example, we show that in all organisms that were analyzed (from bacteria to Human), ribosome allocation is optimized to give maximal translation rate in minimal cost. In addition, we provide the first direct estimate for the effect of codon order on protein abundance, showing that in E. coli and S. cerevisiae it can solely account for more than 20% of the variation in this quantity.
