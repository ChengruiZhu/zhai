-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphyrin (TMPyP4) between its two salt forms, i.e., tetratosylate and tetrachloride, was conducted by using ESI-TOF-MS, UV-melting measurement, and molecular modeling methods. Besides cation TMPyP4, the tosyl anion was found to bind to human telomeric DNA G-quadruplex with multiple binding stoichiometries from 1:1 to 3:1 observed in ESI-TOF-MS spectra, indicating that the stabilization activity of TMPyP4 tetratosylate on G-quadruplex is derived from a synergetic effect of both TMPyP4 cation and tosyl anion. A molecular modeling study suggests that a tosyl anion fills up the vacant space between TMPyP4 cation and DNA G-quadruplex and thus stabilizes the complex by 3.8 kcal/mol. Therefore, it is estimated that TMPyP4 tetratosylate’s activity might not reflect the real effect of TMPyP4 cation in some bioassays related to G-quadruplex stabilization. This was verified by the results of less binding affinity of TMPyP4 tetrachloride with DNA G-quadruplex obtained from ESI-TOF-MS measurement, and of 2.27 °C less thermal stabilization of TMPyP4 tetrachloride for DNA G-quadruplex, compared to its tetratosylate under the same conditions. Our study demonstrated the influence of counter ions of TMPyP4 on G-quadruplex binding, which sheds light on the proper usage of TMPyP4 salt in the chemical and biological research associated with G-quadruplex binding. Subsequently, the binding of TMPyP4 tetrachloride to human telomeric RNA G-quadruplexes was studied with ESI-TOF-MS technique. The binding constants of TMPyP4 with human telomeric G-quadruplexes indicated that TMPyP4 binds to human telomeric RNA G-quadruplex one order of magnitude stronger than DNA counterpart. This is a comprehensive mass spectrometric report on binding study of TMPyP4 with human telomeric DNA/RNA G-quadruplexes.
