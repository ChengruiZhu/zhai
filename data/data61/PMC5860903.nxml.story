The clinical effectiveness of percutaneous and transforaminal endoscopic discectomy procedures has been evaluated by the system used or compared to open laminectomy or micro-discectomy but are not evaluated based on the location and characteristics of the abnormal disc. This review proposes that outcomes are primarily related to disc size, biomechanics, location, and associated segmental fibrotic and bone changes as well as the surgeon's skill in using various systems rather than the specific system used. In these cases, the surgeon needs to decide if the goal of the procedure is simply internal decompression of an abnormal but contained herniated disc or release of the entrapped nerve root by a large contained disc, extruded and migrated disc fragment, or coexistent foraminal stenosis. Percutaneous and tubular transforaminal procedures are quite different, technically ranging from simple discectomy aspirating probes to larger endoscopic systems, providing the capability to remove large extruded free disc fragments, with or without foraminotomy. Recently, the ability to perform interbody fusion has been added to the range of procedures able to be performed endoscopically. At the same time, biologic solutions to disc degeneration are rapidly evolving and may have a place in combination with these procedures. This article reviews the interrelationship between clinical signs and symptoms, radiologic findings, and the biochemistry and biomechanics of the affected disc segment. Understanding the role played by all these factors enables the surgeon to evaluate both the disc and surrounding bone structures pre-operatively to determine if the clinical signs and symptoms are related to enlargement and displacement of a contained disc or compression or impingement of the nerve root. Based on this, the surgeon can choose different surgical systems, allowing simple decompression of a contained disc, possibly adding biologics, with a 'small' system, while a large herniated disc, or extruded fragment, causing root impingement, would require a ‘larger’ system that provides direct endoscopic visualization within the epidural space, foraminal decompression with drills, and direct surgical manipulation and freeing of the nerve root. By choosing the surgical system based on characteristics such as disc size, location, and associated inflammatory and fibrotic changes, the effectiveness of minimally invasive procedures will be more consistent and improve as the surgeon's diagnostic and operative skills improve.
