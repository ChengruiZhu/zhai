In severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), systemic inflammation leads to endothelial dysfunction and activation of coagulation. Thrombotic disorders in acute pancreatitis (AP) include disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Recently, angiopoietin-2 and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1) were proposed as markers of endothelial dysfunction in acute states. Our aim was to assess the frequency of coagulation abnormalities in the early phase of AP and evaluate the relationships between serum angiopoietin-2 and sFlt-1 and severity of coagulopathy. Sixty-nine adult patients with AP were recruited: five with SAP, 15 with moderately severe AP (MSAP) and 49 with mild AP. Six patients were diagnosed with DIC according to International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) score. All patients had at least one abnormal result of routine tests of hemostasis (low platelet count, prolonged clotting times, decreased fibrinogen, and increased D-dimer). The severity of coagulopathy correlated with AP severity according to 2012 Atlanta criteria, bedside index of severity in AP and duration of hospital stay. D-dimers correlated independently with C-reactive protein and studied markers of endothelial dysfunction. Angiopoietin-2, D-dimer, and ISTH score were best predictors of SAP, while sFlt-1 was good predictor of MSAP plus SAP. In clinical practice, routine tests of hemostasis may assist prognosis of AP.
