Variable results of pain alleviation in response to acupuncture have been reported, complicating its interpretation. Sources of variability are probably multi-factorial, including the contribution of gender related effects. Gender related variation in perceived pain has been discussed frequently, but documented effects of acupuncture referring to gender are sparse. Furthermore, factors such as operationalisation of the outcome variable and the statistical method for evaluation could also be sources of variability. When pain is regarded as subjective, the produced data should be treated as ordinal. The rank-based method by Svensson, taking the non-metric qualities of the ordinal data into account as well as the variability at the group and the individual level, is therefore an alternative. The present commentary aims to (1) evaluate changes in electrical sensory thresholds and electrical pain thresholds after low frequency electro-acupuncture separately in healthy women and men; (2) introduce and exemplify the method by Svensson in a user-friendly approach. To analyze the systematic patterns of change in thresholds, indicating evidence of treatment on a group level, the relative position (RP) and relative concentration (RC), were measured. The variation related to the individual, the relative rank variation (RV) was also measured. The results were divergent between women (
