Hsp70 chaperone controls proteostasis and anti-stress responses in rapidly renewing cancer cells, making it an important target for therapeutic compounds. To date several Hsp70 inhibitors are presented with remarkable anticancer activity, however their clinical application is limited by the high toxicity towards normal cells. This study aimed to develop assays to search for the substances that reduce the chaperone activity of Hsp70 and diminish its protective function in cancer cells. On our mind the resulting compounds alone should be safe and function in combination with drugs widely employed in oncology. We constructed systems for the analysis of substrate-binding and refolding activity of Hsp70 and to validate the assays screened the substances representing most diverse groups of chemicals of InterBioScreen library. One of the inhibitors was AEAC, an N-amino-ethylamino derivative of colchicine, which toxicity was two-orders lower than that of parent compound. In contrast to colchicine, AEAC inhibited substrate-binding and refolding functions of Hsp70 chaperones. The results of a drug affinity responsive target stability assay, microscale thermophoresis and molecular docking show that AEAC binds Hsp70 with nanomolar affinity. AEAC was found to penetrate C6 rat glioblastoma and B16 mouse melanoma cells and reduce there the function of the Hsp70-mediated refolding system. Although the cytotoxic and growth inhibitory activities of AEAC were minimal, the compound was shown to increase the antitumor efficiency of doxorubicin in tumor cells of both types. When the tumors were grown in animals, AEAC administration in combination with doxorubicin exerted maximal therapeutic effect prolonging animal survival by 10â€“15 days and reducing tumor growth rate by 60%. To our knowledge, this is the first time that this approach to the high-throughput analysis of chaperone inhibitors has been applied, and it can be useful in the search for drug combinations that are effective in the treatment of highly resistant tumors.
