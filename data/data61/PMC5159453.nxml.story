Chronic diseases are invariably associated with decreased functioning ability of the individual in one form or the other depending upon the system/organ involved. Disability consequent to the disease is the major factor affecting the patient’s physical and psychosocial well-being; in other words, the ‘Quality of Life (QOL)’. Besides the disease itself, the treatment and its consequences are also major determinants of QOL of the patients. Globally, glaucoma, which is emerging as one of the leading causes of blindness, is one such chronic ophthalmic disease characterized by a progressive loss of visual function and a potential to cause irreversible blindness, if not treated at an early stage. Patients of glaucoma need to take lifelong medications in order to keep their intraocular pressure within limits. It’s impact on the daily life of patients cannot be overexpressed and compounded by the fact that it remains asymptomatic for a considerable time after the disease has set in; has led to new imperatives in diagnosis, treatment and epidemiological and outcome studies. Assessment of the debilitating effect of glaucoma and side effects of its treatment on the emotional and physical QOL of the patient is therefore an important criterion for arriving at the treatment regimen. An extensive literature search was done on Pubmed Central, Pubmed and Google Scholar using the keywords ‘glaucoma’, ‘quality of life in glaucoma’, ‘management in POAG’ and ‘QOL assessment tools’. Various tools available for the assessment of QOL, and their advantages and limitations have been reviewed in this article.
