Parry-Romberg syndrome (PRS) is a rare condition manifesting with progressive hemifacial atrophy. Although reported PRS clinical disturbances include facial pain and recent studies raised the possibility that PRS-related pain is a neuropathic pain condition due to the trigeminal nerve damage, no studies have directly investigated cutaneous innervation and trigeminal pathway function in patients with this rare condition. In a 50-year-old woman presenting with a 10-year history of slowly progressive hemifacial atrophy and facial pain, we investigated large myelinated fibres with masticatory muscle electromyography and trigeminal reflexes, and tested small myelinated and unmyelinated fibres with laser-evoked potentials. We also investigated cutaneous innervation by measuring the intraepidermal nerve fibre (IENF) density after skin biopsy of the supraorbital regions. We found that neurophysiological data and IENF density came within normal ranges, with no differences between normal and affected side. Our study showing that the standard reference techniques for assessing cutaneous innervation and trigeminal pathway function disclosed no abnormalities in this patient with PRS suggest that this rare and disabling condition is not associated with trigeminal system damage. These findings indicate that in this patient PRS-related pain is not a neuropathic pain condition, rather it probably arises from the musculoskeletal abnormalities.
