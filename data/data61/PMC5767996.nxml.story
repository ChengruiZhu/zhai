In the modern day dental practice, synergy is fundamental. This synergistic effect must exist among various disciplines of dentistry for proper diagnosis, treatment planning, sequencing and execution of treatment in complex and challenging dental situations. Such collaborative effect between an orthodontist and a periodontist is essential as both works with same element, the tooth as crown-root unit with its supporting tissues. The orthodontic treatment is carried out through the medium of periodontium, so a healthy tooth supporting system is an essential prerequisite. Every potential candidate for orthodontic treatment should undergo a thorough periodontal examination. Any lousily diagnosed or conducted orthodontic treatment could be a facilitator of periodontal inflammatory or infectious process especially when the patient's oral hygiene is explicitly deficient. This case report demonstrates a challenging situation to a periodontist where patient had completed her orthodontic treatment but ended up with severe periodontal disease. The patient was thoroughly examined and a comprehensive treatment was planned and executed. Regenerative surgical procedures were done using platelet rich fibrin and hydroxyapitatite bone graft. Patient was followed up for 2 years. As sequelae of surgical procedures, patient had developed black triangles in the anterior region. The patient was unwilling for further perioplastic surgical procedures and further orthodontic treatment, so a gingival prosthesis using valplast was fabricated addressing her esthetic concerns.
