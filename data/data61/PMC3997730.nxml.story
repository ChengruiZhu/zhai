Inflammatory pseudotumors are rare benign tumors consisting of cellular and stromal elements of a localized reactive process. While inflammatory pseudotumors are commonly detected in the lung and occasionally in other organs, only one case of inflammatory pseudotumor of the thymus has been reported in the literature to date. This report presents a 54-year-old male patient with inflammatory pseudotumor of the thymus accompanied by pulmonary inflammation. The patient presented with chest pain and moderate fever for 12 days. Enhanced computed tomography of the thorax revealed an anterior mediastinal solid and cystic mass, which constricted the left brachiocephalic vein accompanied by bilateral lung inflammation and marginal pleural effusion. The patient underwent a median sternotomy for the surgical removal of the mass. Histologically, the resected mass was composed of necrotic and fibrous tissues and inflammatory infiltrates, and the diagnosis was confirmed as an inflammatory pseudotumor of the thymus. The patientâ€™s symptoms were resolved following surgery and the patient remained asymptomatic during the six-month follow-up period. In addition, we reviewed the previous literature and discussed the diagnosis and management of our patient. This report provides further insights into the pathogenesis and underlying mechanisms of inflammatory pseudotumors of the thymus to aid in the diagnosis and development of effective therapies.
