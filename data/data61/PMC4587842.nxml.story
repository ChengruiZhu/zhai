All physiological processes are influenced by temperature. This is a particular problem for the nervous system, as temperature changes can disrupt the well-balanced flow of ions across the cell membrane necessary for maintaining nerve cell function. Possessing compensatory mechanisms that counterbalance detrimental temperature effects and maintain vital behaviors is especially important for poikilothermic animals, because they do not actively maintain their body temperature and can experience substantial temperature fluctuations. In this study, we analyze the mechanisms that allow the nervous system to maintain rhythmic activity over a range of different temperatures. To do so, we use the well-characterized central pattern generator of the stomatogastric nervous system of the crab that controls the motion of the gut. In this system, when experimentally isolated from the rest of the nervous system, even a small temperature increase can lead to termination of rhythmic activity due to a change in the balance of ionic conductances at elevated temperatures. However, the intact animal can compensate for these detrimental temperature effects. We demonstrate that such compensation can be achieved by restoring the balance of ionic conductance via an increase in neuromodulator release from projection neurons that control the motor circuits. We conclude that temperature compensation via neuromodulation may be a widespread phenomenon since it allows quick and flexible compensation of temperature influences on the nervous system.
