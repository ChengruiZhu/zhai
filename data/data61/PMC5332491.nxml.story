Monocytes and macrophages are key players in inflammatory processes following an infection or tissue damage. Monocytes adhere and extravasate into the inflamed tissue, differentiate into macrophages, and produce inflammatory mediators to combat the pathogens. In addition, they take up dead cells and debris and, therefore, take part in the resolution of inflammation. The multifunctional enzyme tissue Transglutaminase (TG2, tTG) is known to participate in most of those monocyte- and macrophage-mediated processes. Moreover, TG2 expression and activity can be regulated by inflammatory mediators. In the present review, we selectively elaborate on the expression, regulation, and contribution of TG2 derived from monocytes and macrophages to inflammatory processes mediated by those cells. In addition, we discuss the role of TG2 in certain pathological conditions, in which inflammation and monocytes and/or macrophages are prominently present, including atherosclerosis, sepsis, and multiple sclerosis. Based on the studies and considerations reported in this review, we conclude that monocyte- and macrophage-derived TG2 is clearly involved in various processes contributing to inflammation. However, TG2â€™s potential as a therapeutic target to counteract the possible detrimental effects or stimulate the potential beneficial effects on monocyte and macrophage responses during inflammation should be carefully considered. Alternatively, as TG2-related parameters can be used as a marker of disease, e.g., in celiac disease, or of disease-stage, e.g., in cancer, we put forward that this could be subject of research for monocyte- or macrophage-derived TG2 in inflammatory diseases.
