Biological requirements for tumor cell proliferation include the sustained increase of structural, energetic, signal transduction and biosynthetic precursors. Because lipids participate in membrane construction, energy storage, and cell signaling. We hypothesized that the differences in lipids between malignant carcinoma and normal controls could be reflected in the bio-fluids. A total of 100 pre-operative plasma samples were collected from 50 oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), 50 normal patients and characterize by lipid profiling using ultra performance liquid chromatography/electro spray ionization mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). The lipid profiles of the OSCC and control samples as well as the different stages were compared. Differentially expressed lipids were categorized as glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids. All glycerophospholipids were decreased, especially phosphatidylcholine and phosphoethanolamine plasmalogens, whereas sphingolipids were increased in the OSCC patients compared to the controls. We further identified 12 staging related lipids, which could be utilized to discriminate early stage patients from advanced stage patients. In the future, the differential lipids may provide biologists with additional information regarding lipid metabolism and guide clinicians in making individualized therapeutic decisions if these results are confirmed in a larger study.
