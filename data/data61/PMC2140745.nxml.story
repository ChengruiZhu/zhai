 1. Collodion membranes of high permeability were found to adsorb weighable amounts of gelatin and egg albumin from solution at 37Â°C. 2. The effect of protein concentration could be expressed fairly well by a hyperbolic equation proposed by Langmuir for the adsorption of gases by a plane surface, while the usual parabolic adsorption equation of Freundlich did not fit the results. 3. In comparing this effect with solutions of varying pH, it was found there was a decided maximum of adsorption in solutions of isoelectric protein. The effects of acids and salts on the amount of gelatin adsorbed were like those observed by Loeb on the viscosity of gelatin solutions, but opposite in direction. The effects of pH on the amount of adsorbed gelatin and on the fluidity of the gelatin solutions were nearly parallel. 4. Membranes made impermeable by long drying took up very little or no gelatin from solution. 5. In the case of membranes of varying permeability the maximum amount of adherent gelatin increased with the permeability and thickness of the membranes, and appeared to be, within limits, a linear function of the relative pore surface of the membranes as calculated from Poiseuille's law. 6. The film of gelatin greatly decreased the permeability of the membranes, as measured by the flow of water through them. The relative cross-section of the pore openings, as calculated from the permeability measurements, was a linear function of the amount of adherent gelatin. These results led to the conclusion that the gelatin formed a film inside the pores.
