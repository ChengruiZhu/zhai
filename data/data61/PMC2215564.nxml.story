A mathematical model is presented which describes the theoretical relationship between ligand concentration and physiological response for systems in which the response is dependent upon simultaneous occupancy of two receptor ligand-binding sites. The treatment considers both the possibility of intrinsic differences between the binding sites with regard to ligand affinity, as well as the possibility of mutually induced changes in affinity resulting from allosteric interactions. Unlike the Monod-Wyman-Changeux formulation for allosteric enzymes, the general model put forward here makes double occupancy an absolute requirement for enzymatic function. It is shown that such a model leads to the prediction of a curvilinear Hill plot from which one can obtain an explicit estimate of the degree of allosteric interaction between the two ligand binding sites as well as the Gibbs standard free energy change for the overall binding reaction. It is then shown that, in the specific instance of Na, K-ATPase-mediated K+ transport by the turkey erythrocyte, the configuration of the Hill curve describing the rate of ouabain-sensitive K+ transport as a function of external K+ concentration conforms closely to that predicted by the model described above. The results are of particular interest because they indicate a strongly cooperative interaction between the two K+ binding sites on the transport protein such that occupancy of one site results in an enhancement of the affinity of the other site for K+ by a minimum of 15- to 20-fold. Finally, we consider in detail a model of the Monod-Wyman- Changeux type in which, by contrast, both singly and doubly occupied forms of the enzyme are assumed to be catalytically active, and which we analogously extend to allow for the possibility of asymmetry between the two ligand binding sites. Although it is shown that the two models can not be differentiated from each other in the present experimental system, they yield virtually identical estimates for the degree of positive cooperativity between the two K+ binding sites.
