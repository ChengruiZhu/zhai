How DNA replicates is a critical question for understanding life. DNA replication remains difficult to investigate in eukaryotes, where it involves a complex, multi-protein apparatus which initiates replication at multiple poorly-defined DNA sequences. This process is far easier to study in viral systems, where the DNA sequences at the origin of replication are well-defined and only one or two proteins are required to initiate replication. In simian virus 40 (SV40), the large T-antigen protein (T-ag) is responsible for recognizing DNA sequences required to start replication, called the origin of replication. SV40 T-ag can also cause DNA to melt or unwind. We report here the crystal structure of the DNA-binding domain of SV40 T-ag on a DNA fragment derived from the viral origin of replication. The structure shows that although T-ag and its functionally analogous protein, papilloma virus E1, share no detectable sequence homology in this region, the two domains bind the DNA in similar ways. In both cases, DNA binding is thought to initiate assembly of a complex of the full-length proteins on DNA. Interestingly, SV40 T-ag DNA-binding domains do not interact with one another when bound to DNA. In addition to describing the molecular details of the DNAâ€“protein interactions and the alterations in protein structure induced by DNA binding, we present a model describing the subsequent assembly events.
