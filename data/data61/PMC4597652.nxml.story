13 players from AGAPE Soccer Academy in Białołęka (year 2002), participated in this study. The control group were 18 young, healthy, and active volunteers (14 male, and 4 female; mean age = 21,4±1,2 years). The dynamic stabilography was recorded on Biodex Balance System device. For data analysis, the bending dispersion in the medial/lateral plane, and anterior/posterior plane, along with the overall stability index (OSI) were tested. The measurements were taken in single-leg stance on the right and left leg respectively. Each testing included 3 repetitions in 30 seconds intervals on the platform’s second level of testing. The preliminary study was performed before the beginning of the season’s preparatory period. During the preparatory period, which lasted 16 weeks, the motor activity training programme was completed (90 minutes, once a week). The programme included elements such as: functional soccer training and stabilization training on an unstable ground, core stability training, dynamic stability exercises, and lower limbs coordination and strength training. After the preparatory period, the health examinations were performed. Test results were statistically analysed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test in order to establish parameters’ changes within the study group, and the U-Mann-Whitney test was applied in order to estimate the variances between the study and control groups. The statistical significance threshold was p≤0,05.
