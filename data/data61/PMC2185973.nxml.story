T cell hybridoma lines were constructed by fusion of DBA/2 alloantigen- activated T cell blasts with the AKR thymoma line BW5147. Certain of the hybridomas prepared in this manner secreted spontaneously into their culture supernates biologically active molecules that displayed B cell- and T cell-activating properties characteristic of allogeneic effect factor (AEF). Cell surface phenotype analysis documented that the hybridomas were, indeed, somatic cell hybrids between the two respective partner cells used for fusion. The B cell-activating properties of these hybridoma supernates was demonstrated by their capacity to stimulate T cell-depleted spleen cells to respond in vitro to T-dependent antigens. The T cell-activating properties of these hybridoma supernates was verified by their capacity to stimulate autonomous development of self-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes and by their capacity to exert mitogenic effects on unprimed T cells. The biologically active molecules secreted by these hybridomas were, like conventional AEF, inhibitable by specific anti-Ia antibodies thus indicating the presence of Ia determinants on the relevant hybridoma products. Finally, these AEF-secreting hybridomas could be stimulated to proliferate and to secrete increased quantities of AEF when exposed to the specific alloantigen-bearing target cells to which the T cell blasts had been originally sensitized.
