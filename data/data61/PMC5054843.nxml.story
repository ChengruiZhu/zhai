. Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM‐MSCs), adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs), and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were treated with soluble extracts of dHACM tissue, and were evaluated for cellular proliferation, migration, and cytokine secretion. Stem cells were analyzed for cell number by DNA assay after 24 h, closure of an acellular zone using microscopy over 3 days, and soluble cytokine production in the medium of treated stem cells was analyzed after 3 days using a multiplex ELISA array. Treatment with soluble extracts of dHACM tissue stimulated BM‐MSCs, ADSCs, and HSCs to proliferate with a significant increase in cell number after 24 h. dHACM treatment accelerated closure of an acellular zone by ADSCs and BM‐MSCs after 3 days, compared to basal medium. BM‐MSCs, ADSCs, and HSCs also modulated endogenous production of a number of various soluble signals, including regulators of inflammation, mitogenesis, and wound healing. dHACM treatment promoted increased proliferation and migration of ADSCs, BM‐MSCs, and HSCs, along with modulation of secreted proteins from those cells. Therefore, dHACM may impact wound healing by amplifying host stem cell populations and modulating their responses in treated wound tissues. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
