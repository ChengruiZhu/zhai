Protein aggregation plays an important pathological role in numerous neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Creutzfeldt-Jakob, the Prion disease and diabetes mellitus. In most cases, misfolded proteins are involved and aggregate irreversibly to form highly ordered insoluble macrostructures, called amyloid fibrils, which deposit in the brain. Studies have revealed that all proteins are capable of forming amyloid fibrils that all share common structural features and therefore aggregation mechanisms. The toxicity of amyloid aggregates is however not attributed to the fibrils themselves but rather to smaller more disordered aggregates, oligomers, forming parallel to or prior to fibrils. Understanding the assembly process of these amyloid oligomers is key to understanding their toxicity mechanism in order to devise a possible treatment strategy targeting these toxic aggregates. Our approach here is to computationally study the aggregation dynamics of a 20-mer of an amyloid peptide GNNQQNY from a prion protein. Our findings suggest that the assembly is a spontaneous process that can be described as a complex nucleation and growth mechanism and which can lead to two classes of morphologies for the aggregates, one of which resembles a protofibril-like structure. Such numerical studies are crucial to understanding the details of fast biological processes and complement well experimental studies.
