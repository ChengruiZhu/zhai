Prolonged maturation of the human cerebral cortex, which extends into the third decade of life, is critical for proper development of executive functions such as higher-order problem-solving and complex cognition. Little is known about changes of post-mitotic neurons during this prolonged maturation period, including changes in epigenetic regulation, and more broadly, in genome organization and function. Such knowledge is critical for a deeper understanding of human development, cognitive abilities, and psychiatric diseases. Here, we identify 1,157 genomic loci in neuronal cells from the prefrontal cortex that show developmental changes in a chromatin mark, histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), which has been associated with regulation of gene expression. Interestingly, the overwhelming majority of these developmentally regulated H3K4me3 peaks were defined by rapid gain or loss of histone methylation during the late prenatal period and the first year after birth, followed by slower changes during early and later childhood and minimal changes thereafter. The genomic sequences showing these dynamic changes in H3K4me3 were enriched with distinct transcription factor motifs. Our findings suggest that there is highly regulated, pre-programmed remodeling of neuronal histone methylation landscapes in the human brain that begins before birth and continues into adolescence.
