This study aimed to determine and quantitate the mammographic and sonographic characteristics in 13 cases of solid neuroendocrine breast carcinoma (NEBC) and to analyze the association of radiological findings with the clinical and histopathologic findings. The clinical data and imaging findings of 13 female patients with histologically confirmed solid NEBC were reviewed. Imaging data were evaluated by two radiologists for a consensual diagnosis. All patients presented with one palpable mass; only 1 experienced occasional breast pain, and 5 complained of fluid discharge. In 7 patients, the masses were firm and mobile. Regional lymph node metastasis was noted in only 1 patient. For the 10 patients who underwent mammography, 6 had a mass, 1 had clustered small nodules with clustered punctuate microcalcifications, 2 had asymmetric focal density, and 1 had solitary punctuate calcification. Most of the masses had irregular shape with indistinct or microlobulated margins. For the 9 patients who underwent ultrasonography (US), 9 masses were depicted, all of which were hypoechoic, mostly with irregular shape and without acoustic phenomena. Different types of acoustic phenomena were also identified. One patient had developed distant metastases during follow-up. NEBC has a variety of presentations, but it is mostly observed on mammograms as a dense, irregular mass with indistinct or microlobulated margins. Sonographically, it typically presents as an irregular, heterogeneously hypoechoic mass with normal sound transmission. Histories of nipple discharge and calcification observed using imaging are not rare.
