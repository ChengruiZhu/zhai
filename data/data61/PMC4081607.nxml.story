Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal solid tumor due to the lack of reliable early detection markers and effective therapies. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression, are involved in tumorigenesis and have a remarkable potential for the diagnosis and treatment of malignancy. In this study, we investigated aberrantly expressed miRNAs involved in PDAC by comparing miRNA expression profiles in PDAC cell lines with a normal pancreas cell line and found that miR-135a was significantly down-regulated in the PDAC cell lines. The microarray results were validated by qRT-PCR in PDAC tissues, paired adjacent normal pancreatic tissues, PDAC cell lines, and a normal pancreas cell line. We then defined the tumor-suppressing significance and function of miR-135a by constructing a lentiviral vector to express miR-135a. The overexpression of miR-135a in PDAC cells decreased cell proliferation and clonogenicity and also induced G1 arrest and apoptosis. We predicted Bmi1 may be a target of miR-135a using bioinformatics tools and found that Bmi1 expression was markedly up-regulated in PDAC. Its expression was inversely correlated with miR-135a expression in PDAC. Furthermore, a luciferase activity assay revealed that miR-135a could directly target the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of Bmi1. Taken together, these results demonstrate that miR-135a targets Bmi1 in PDAC and functions as a tumor suppressor. miR-135a may offer a new perspective for the development of effective miRNA-based therapy for PDAC.
