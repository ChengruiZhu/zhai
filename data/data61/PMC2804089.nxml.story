Over the past decades, randomized clinical trials have assessed and validated the concept of larynx preservation. This new concept has obviously modified the treatment algorithm for laryngopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. However surgery for larynx and hypopharynx cancer remains indicated in many cases. Initial partial surgery is indicated for early diseases. This surgery may be performed endoscopically or openly. The results are excellent in terms of local control and function. Transoral robotic surgery is under evaluation. Initial radical surgery is indicated for advanced diseases in case of very infiltrative tumor, in case of cartilage destruction or when tolerance and/or compliance to chemotherapy-based approached is questionable. Larynx preservation is to be discussed between these two situations. In randomized trials evaluating the different larynx preservation strategies, a substantial number of larynxes could be preserved without compromising disease control or survival. The best approach in terms of quality of function preservation, overall acute and late toxicity, disease control and survival is still a matter of clinical research. It must be stressed that salvage surgery is a definite part of these larynx preservation protocols in order to maintain the ultimate disease control. This discussion underscored the need of a multidisciplinary decision making and the need of a coordinated clinical research.
