 In 87 rabbits, some of which received intravenously at various intervals small, and some large, doses of killed staphylococci, the following findings were obtained. 1. There occurred a hyperplasia of lymph nodes, spleen and thymus, that is to say, a status thymicolymphaticus. This phenomenon is explained as due to immediate local irritation caused by bacteria and their products and by certain "toxins" partly of exogenous, partly of endogenous, origin. 2. The lymphocytosis which appeared was parallel in time and degree with the hyperplasia of the peripheral lymph nodes (axillary, popliteal and cervical lymph nodes) and probably originated in the pseudo-secondary nodules of these nodes. 3. There occurred intense mesenchymal reaction in the vascular connective tissue of the lungs, liver and spleen and after large doses slighter ones in adrenals, kidneys and heart. These reactions correspond with Oeller's adventitial reactions and Siegmund's intima proliferations. In the interstitial tissue of these organs as well as in the walls of the minor vessels proliferations of cells, partly of the type of lymphocytes and plasma cells, partly of that of histiocytes and reticulo-endothelial cells, appeared, which, after large doses, were mixed with many giant cells of Langerhans' type. After small doses lymphocytes and plasma cells predominated, after large doses histiocytes and reticulo-endothelial cells. Because these reactions occurred immediately after the first injection, they can be regarded as primary reactions of the organism to bacteria and their products.
