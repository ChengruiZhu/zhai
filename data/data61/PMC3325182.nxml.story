The evolution of multicellularity is one of the most fascinating topics of evolutionary biology. Without multicellularity the incredible diversity of extant life would not be possible. In many multicellular organisms with specialized cells, some cell types become terminally differentiated (somatic cells) and lose the ability to reproduce new organisms while other cells maintain this ability (germline). Little is known about the conditions that favor the evolution of terminal differentiation in multicellular organisms. To understand this problem we have developed a computational model, inspired by multicellular cyanobacteria, in which the cells in an organism composed of two cell types (photosynthetic and nitrogen fixing) are allowed to evolve from germline to soma cells. We find three striking results. First, faster dividing cell types always evolve to become the germline. Second, the conditions under which we find different outcomes from the model are in good agreement with the different forms of development observed in multicellular cyanobacteria. Third, some conditions lead to a symbiotic state in which the two cell types separate into different lineages evolving independently of one another. Remarkably, cyanobacteria are also known to engage in symbiotic relationships with plants, producing fixed nitrogen for the plant in exchange for carbohydrates.
