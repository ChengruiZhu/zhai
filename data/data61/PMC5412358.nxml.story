Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disorder characterized by chondrocyte apoptosis and degeneration of articular cartilage resulting in loss of mobility and pain. Inflammation plays a key role in the development and progression of OA both on the side of apoptosis and repair, while its exact role in pathogenesis has yet to be fully elucidated. Few studies have examined the cellular composition (inflammatory cells and/or progenitor cells) in the synovium of patients with pre-OA (asymptomatic with cartilage damage). Therefore, in the current study, mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) and macrophages were enumerated within normal, pre-OA and OA synovium. No differences were observed between MPCs in normal vs. pre-OA, however, fewer macrophages were observed in pre-OA vs. normal synovium. Osteoarthritic synovium contained greater numbers of both MPCs and macrophages. Interestingly, the localization of MPCs and macrophages was affected by disease severity. In normal and pre-OA synovium, MPCs and macrophages co-localized, while in OA synovium, MPCs and macrophage populations were spatially distinct. Examining the cellular interactions between MPCs and macrophages in synovium may be essential for understanding the role of these cells in the onset and/or pathogenesis of the disease. This study has provided a first step by examining these cell types both spatially and temporally (e.g., disease severity). Further cellular and molecular studies will be needed to determine the functions of these cells in the context of disease and in relation to each other and the joint as a whole.
