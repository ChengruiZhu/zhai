Sujiaonori, a river alga growing in the Kochi prefecture, Japan, contains several bioactive compounds such as sulfated polysaccharides (ulvans), ω-3 fatty acids, and vitamins. Dietary intake of this alga-based supplement has been reported to increase circulatory adiponectin, a salutary hormone that is reported to be associated with healthy longevity and prevents a number of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. This report highlights the anti-allergic and skin health enhancing effects of Sujiaonori-derived ulvan (Tosalvan) and supplement, respectively. RBL-2H3 cell line was used to investigate the anti-allergic effect of algal SP through the evaluation of β-hexosaminidase activity. Algal sulfated polysaccharides or SP (Tosalvan, Yoshino SP) were extracted from powders of dried alga samples provided by local food manufacturers. Report on the effect of daily dietary intake of Sujiaonori-based supplement on skin health is part of a four-week clinical investigation that, in comparison with a supplement made of 70% corn starch powder and 30% spinach powder mixture (twice 3 g daily), explore the beneficial effects of Sujiaonori algal biomaterial (SBM; 3 g taken twice daily) on cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and skin health in a sample of Japanese women. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was the skin health marker used in this study and was measured with the use of a corneometer. Significant reduction of β-hexosaminidase activity was observed in Tosalvan and Yoshino SP-treated cells (vs. control;
