Cross-linking B cell antigen receptor (BCR) elicits early signal transduction events, including activation of protein tyrosine kinases, phosphorylation of receptor components, activation of phospholipase C- gamma (PLC-gamma), and increases in intracellular free Ca2+. In this article, we report that cross-linking the BCR led to a rapid translocation of cytosolic protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 1C to the particulate fraction, where it became associated with a 140-150-kD tyrosyl-phosphorylated protein. Western blotting analysis identified this 140-150-kD protein to be CD22. The association of PTP-1C with CD22 was mediated by the NH2-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of PTP-1C. Complexes of either CD22/PTP-1C/Syk/PLC-gamma(1) could be isolated from B cells stimulated by BCR engagement or a mixture of hydrogen peroxidase and sodium orthovanadate, respectively. The binding of PLC- gamma(1) and Syk to tyrosyl-phosphorylated CD22 was mediated by the NH2- terminal SH2 domain of PLC-gamma(1) and the COOH-terminal SH2 domain of Syk, respectively. These observations suggest that tyrosyl- phosphorylated CD22 may downmodulate the activity of this complex by dephosphorylation of CD22, Syk, and/or PLC-gamma(1). Transient expression of CD22 and a null mutant of PTP-1C (PTP-1CM) in COS cells resulted in an increase in tyrosyl phosphorylation of CD22 and its interaction with PTP-1CM. By contrast, CD22 was not tyrosyl phosphorylated or associated with PTP-1CM in the presence of wild-type PTP-1C. These results suggest that tyrosyl-phosphorylated CD22 may be a substrate for PTP-1C regulates tyrosyl phosphorylation of CD22.
