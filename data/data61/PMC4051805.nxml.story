 (IJTMB) has as its core a key interest in and mission to develop the practice of therapeutic massage and bodywork by contributing to the field’s body of knowledge. The IJTMB Editorial Board understands that one’s daily practice provides the initial testing ground for the development of practice-based knowledge and, ultimately, expertise. Consequently, this practice-based knowledge and experience provides fertile ground for research ideas that further refine our understanding and come full circle to enhance clinical efficacy. Ultimately, without discourse and knowledge transference, the possibility of growing the body of knowledge for therapeutic massage and bodywork or stimulating research in the field is lost. To facilitate discourse and transference of knowledge within the field of therapeutic massage and bodywork, the IJTMB is launching a new journal component entitled Trigger Points: Topical Dialogue amongst Therapeutic Massage & Bodywork Practitioners and Educators. The purpose of IJTMB’s Trigger Points is to “trigger” the sharing and discussion of knowledge and expertise among therapeutic massage and bodywork practitioners, educators, and researchers about different approaches to treating specific conditions or addressing specific population issues. Each IJTMB issue, starting with this issue, will include a call for responses to the next Trigger Points topic. Publication of the results for each topic will be in the second issue after the initial call for submissions. With your participation, these IJTMB Trigger Points columns will spark dynamic dialogue, perhaps even collaborations, in the therapeutic massage and bodywork field across practitioners, educators, and researchers.
