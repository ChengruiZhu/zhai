Here, we retrospectively compared the differences in clinicopathological behaviors and prognosis of lung cancer from the First Affiliated Hospital (CMU1, n=513), Shengjing Hospital (CMUS, n=1021), Tumor Hospital (CMUT, n=5378) of China Medical University, the First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian (DMU, n=2251) and Jinzhou (JMU, n=630) Medical University, Takaoka Kouseiren Hospital (Takaoka, n=163) of Japan. Japanese lung cancer patients showed smaller tumor size, lower TNM staging, lower ratio of squamous cell carcinoma and higher ratio of small and large cell carcinomas than Chinese patients (p<0.05). Survival analysis showed that tumor size was employed as a prognostic factor for the Japanese and Chinese cancer patients (p<0.05). In DMU and CMUS, the ratios of female patients or adenocarcinoma were higher than other hospitals (p<0.05), while the patients from CMUT and CMU1 were younger than the others (p<0.05). The ratios of squamous cell carcinoma from CMUT, CMU1 and JMU were higher than the others, while it was the same for the ratio of large and small cell carcinoma in Takaoka and CMU1 (p<0.05). TNM staging was higher in CMUT than JMU and Takaoka (p<0.05). The female patients of lung cancer showed young prone, large tumor size, a high ratio of adenocarcinoma and advanced TNM staging in comparison to the counterpart (p<0.05). The younger patients of lung cancer displayed smaller tumor size, higher ratio of adenocarcinoma, lower TNM staging than the elder in Takaoka (p<0.05). There were more aggressive behaviors and shorter survival time for Chinese than Japanese lung cancer patients. The prevention of lung cancer should be strengthened by establishing a systematic and effective screening strategy, especially for the young and female patients.
