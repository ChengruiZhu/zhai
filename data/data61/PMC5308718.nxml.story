PADI4 (peptidyl deiminase isoform 4) is overexpressed in many tumor tissues and converts arginine residues to citrulline residues. This study used an Illumina SNP microarray and a TaqMan assay to determine the possible association of the PADI4 gene with various tumor risks. Both genotyping methods demonstrated significant associations between the tag SNPs rs1635566 and rs882537 in the PADI4 locus with gastric carcinoma in two independent cohorts. Based on this genotyping result, we used the Cancer Pathway Finder, p53 Signaling, Signal Transduction and Tumor Metastasis PCR arrays to investigate the tumorigenic pathway of PADI4 in MNK-45 cells derived from gastric carcinoma. We detected significantly decreased expression levels of CXCR2, KRT14 and TNF-α in MNK-45 cells that were treated with anti-PADI4 siRNA. We also detected increased expression of these three genes in MNK-45 cells transfected with a pcDNA3.1 plasmid overexpressing PADI4. A highly similar result was also obtained for SGC 7901 cells, which also originate from gastric carcinoma. Our result indicates that the PADI4 gene has genetic susceptibility in gastric carcinoma. PADI4 contributes to gastric tumorigenesis by upregulating CXCR2, KRT14 and TNF-α expression, which are well known to activate angiogenesis, cell proliferation, cell migration and the immune microenvironment in tumors.
