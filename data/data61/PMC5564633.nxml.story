Coronary plaque rupture is the most common cause of acute coronary syndrome. However, the timely biomarker-based diagnosis of plaque rupture remains a major unmet clinical challenge. Balloon dilatation and stent implantation during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) could cause plaque injury and rupture. Here we aimed to assess the possibility of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) as biomarkers of acute coronary plaque rupture by virtue of the natural model of PCI-induced plaque rupture. Stable coronary artery disease patients underwent PCI with single stent implantation were recruited and a three-phase approach was conducted in the present study: (i) profiling of plasma miRNAs in a group of patients before (0 h) and after balloon dilatation for 1 h (1 h vs. 0 h), (ii) replication of significant miRNAs in the second group of patients (1 h vs. 0 h), (iii) validation of a multi-miRNAs panel in the third group of patients (0.5 h, 1 h vs. 0 h). Out of 24 miRNAs selected for replication, 6 miRNAs remained significantly associated with plaque rupture. In the validation phase, combinations of miR-483-5p and miR-451a showed the highest area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) (0.982; CI: 0.907-0.999) in patients with plaque rupture for 0.5 h; combinations of miR-483-5p and miR-155-5p showed the highest AUC (0.898; CI: 0.790-0.962) after plaque rupture for 1 h. In conclusion, using a profiling-replication-validation model, we identified 3 miRNAs including miR-155-5p, miR-483-5p and miR-451a, which may be biomarkers for the early identification of plaque rupture.
