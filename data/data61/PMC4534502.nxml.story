Traditional cardiovascular risk factors have well-known limitations for the accurate assessment of individual cardiovascular risk. Unlike risk factor-based scores which rely on probabilistic calculations derived from population-based studies, coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring, and carotid ultrasound allow for the direct visualization and quantification of subclinical atherosclerosis with the potential for a more accurate, personalized risk assessment and treatment approach. Among strategies used to guide preventive management, CAC scoring has consistently and convincingly outperformed traditional risk factors for the prediction of adverse cardiovascular events. Moreover, several studies have demonstrated the potential of CAC testing to improve precision for the use of more intensive pharmacologic therapies, such as aspirin and statins, in patients most likely to derive benefit, as compared to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk calculators. By comparison to CAC, the role of carotid ultrasound for the measurement of carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) remains less well-elucidated but may be significantly improved with the inclusion of plaque screening and novel three-dimensional measurements of plaque volume and morphology. Despite significant evidence supporting the ability of non-invasive atherosclerosis imaging (particularly CAC) to guide preventive management, imaging remains an under-utilized strategy among current guidelines and clinical practice. Herein, we review evidence regarding CAC and carotid ultrasound for patient risk classification, with a comparison of these techniques to currently advocated traditional risk factor-based scores.
