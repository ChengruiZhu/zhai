Environmental protection has the foremost importance in the present day life of mankind. Scientists have been researching for technologies naturally available for enhancement of agriculture, management of agricultural waste, etc. Indigenous Microorganisms (IMO’s)-based technology is one such great technology which is applied in the eastern part of world for the extraction of minerals, enhancement of agriculture and waste management. Indigenous microorganisms are a group of innate microbial consortium that inhabits the soil and the surfaces of all living things inside and outside which have the potentiality in biodegradation, bioleaching, biocomposting, nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility and as well in the production of plant growth hormones. Without these microbes, the life will be wretched and melancholic on this lively planet for the survival of human race. That is why, environmental restoration and safeguarding target via the indigenous microbes in a native manner to turn out the good-for-nothing and useless waste into productive bioresources is the primary concern of this review. Based on the collection sites, the process of collection and isolation methods are different as they may vary from place to place. Ultimately, in this way to a meaningful and significant extent, we can bridge the gap between the horrifying environmental distress and the hostile activities that have been constantly provoked by human kind—by getting these indigenous microorganisms into action.
