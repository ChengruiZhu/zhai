In the present study, two female patients with unilateral scleritis without systemic complications were examined. Both patients were suffering from ocular pain and received corticosteroid therapy. The first patient, a 45-year-old woman, was diagnosed with scleritis and iritis in her right eye. Topical corticosteroid treatment could eradicate the iritis but not the scleritis. Oral corticosteroid administration and corticosteroid pulse therapy were applied with little effect. The application of systemic cyclosporine had a satisfactory effect in controlling the scleritis. The other patient, a 60-year-old woman, was suffering from scleritis and lid swelling in her right eye. Not only did topical and systemic corticosteroid therapy prove insufficient, they also resulted in the elevation of her intraocular pressure. After termination of corticosteroid therapy, the systemic cyclosporine was applied orally. Subsequently, the patient's scleritis improved without any severe side effects. Scleritis is a painful and destructive inflammatory disease of the sclera that causes congestion of the scleral venous plexus. In this study, we have established a new grading system for assessing activity in scleritis that can score the extent of ocular pain and the area of congestion. This system provides a practical method for following the clinical course and monitoring the outcome of therapy. We report two cases of unilateral scleritis that were resistant to corticosteroid therapy but responsive to systemic administration of cyclosporine. Findings from these cases indicate that cyclosporine is an effective drug for controlling severe scleritis.
