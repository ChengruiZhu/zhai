 derivative, could inhibit the diabetic bone loss in streptozotocin-induced type I diabetic rats. ELD (10, 20, or 40 ng/kg), alfacalcidol (ALF; 25, 50, or 100 ng/kg), or vehicle was administered 5 times per week for 12 weeks from 1 week after diabetes induction. Normal control rats received the vehicle. Bone turnover markers, bone mineral density (BMD), and biomechanical strength of the lumbar spine and femur were measured, and bone histomorphometry was performed. Content of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in the femoral shaft was also determined. In diabetic rats, serum osteocalcin (OC) concentration was lower and urinary excretion of deoxypyridinoline (DPD) tended to be higher than in normal rats. Areal BMD and maximum load of the lumbar vertebrae and femoral shaft were lower in diabetic rats than in normal rats. All doses of ELD and the highest dose of ALF reduced urinary DPD excretion, but had no effect on serum OC. The 20 and 40 ng/kg doses of ELD prevented decreases in BMD and the highest dose of ELD prevented the reduction in maximum load of the lumbar vertebrae, while ALF did not change these parameters. ELD and ALF did not affect areal BMD or biomechanical strength of the femoral shaft. In diabetic rats, bone volume and trabecular thickness in the trabecular bone of the lumbar vertebrae decreased and trabecular separation increased compared to normal rats. ELD and ALF prevented diabetes-induced deterioration of trabecular microstructure. AGE content in the femoral cortical bone increased in the diabetic rats, and ELD and ALF did not change AGE content compared to the diabetic rats. These results indicated that ELD suppressed bone resorption and prevented trabecular bone loss and deterioration of trabecular microstructure, resulting in prevention of reduction in biomechanical strength in type I diabetic rats.
