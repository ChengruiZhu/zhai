Morphologically controlled synthesis of ferric oxide nano/micro particles has been carried out by using solvothermal route. Structural characterization displays that the predominant morphologies are porous hollow spheres, microspheres, micro rectangular platelets, octahedral and irregular shaped particles. It is also observed that solvent has significant effect on morphology such as shape and size of the particles. All the morphologies obtained by using different solvents are nearly uniform with narrow size distribution range. The values of full width at half maxima (FWHM) of all the products were calculated to compare their size distribution. The FWHM value varies with size of the particles for example small size particles show polydispersity whereas large size particles have shown monodispersity. The size of particles increases with decrease in polarity of the solvent whereas their shape changes from spherical to rectangular/irregular with decrease in polarity of the solvent. The catalytic activities of all the products were investigated for both dry and wet processes such as thermal decomposition of ammonium per chlorate (AP) and reduction of 4-nitrophenol in aqueous media. The results indicate that each product has a tendency to act as a catalyst. The porous hollow spheres decrease the thermal decomposition temperature of AP by 140 °C and octahedral Fe
