Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are biological molecules bridging the innate and acquired immune systems of the defense mechanism. They have been found to be effective against not only Gram-positive and -negative bacterial species but also fungi and viruses with their broad spectrum of activity. Among the various niches where they are found in the human body, in the oral cavity, the AMPs are secreted by the epithelial cells, defense cells, crevicular fluid, and in the salivary secretions and form the first line of defense against bacterial invasion. The present review gathers information from a number of literature reviews, systematic reviews articles, and original research work to come to a conclusion regarding the use of AMPs. AMPs are miraculous in that they either do not or develop resistance very slowly and hence are supposed to be great candidates for developing antibiotics. Their use in mouthwash formulations, topical applications, etc., as therapeutic modalities has found some success in the past but is still undergoing trials. In periodontal disease, their active role as biomarkers by the relative upregulations and downregulations during disease progression has also been recognized. The early recognition of these biomarker changes can help regulate the progression of periodontal diseases. They also control the development and progression of biofilm formation and might potentially contribute toward the development of therapeutic mimetics, probiotics, and antibiotics in the near future.
