Micro-computed tomography can be applied for the assessment of the micro-architectural characteristics of the cortical and trabecular bones in either physiological or disease conditions. However, reports often lack a detailed description of the methodological steps used to analyse these images, such as the volumes of interest, the algorithms used for image filtration, the approach used for image segmentation, and the bone parameters quantified, thereby making it difficult to compare or reproduce the studies. This study addresses this critical need and aims to provide standardized assessment and consistent parameter reporting related to quantitative jawbone image analysis. Various regions of the rat jawbones were screened for their potential for standardized micro-computed tomography analysis. Furthermore, the volumes of interest that were anticipated to be most susceptible to bone structural changes in response to experimental interventions were defined. In the mandible, two volumes of interest were selected, namely, the condyle and the trabecular bone surrounding the three molars. In the maxilla, the maxillary tuberosity region and the inter-radicular septum of the second molar were considered as volumes of interest. The presented protocol provides a standardized and reproducible methodology for the analysis of relevant jawbone volumes of interest and is intended to ensure global, accurate, and consistent reporting of its morphometry. Furthermore, the proposed methodology has potential, as a variety of rodent animal models would benefit from its implementation.
