 genes. However, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors failed in some patients and for this reason we explored BER key enzyme expression. In this study, the expression of BER enzymes (redox factor 1/apurinic-apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (REF1/APEX1), NTH endonuclease III-like 1 (NTHL1), 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1), PARP1) and of the scaffold protein XRCC1 (X-ray repair complementing defective repair in Chinese hamster cells 1) were investigated in familial (BRCA-related and not) and sporadic breast cancer cases. Furthermore, miR17 expression was measured because of its role in the epigenetic regulation of BRCA1. Gene expression was evaluated in BRCA1-mutated cell lines, SUM149PT and SUM1315MO2, and in a BRCA1-proficient triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cell line. A cohort of 27 familial and 16 sporadic breast cancer patients was then examined to confirm results obtained from the cell line model. APEX1/REF1 was found to be upregulated in familial BRCA-wild-type and sporadic cases, indicating this enzyme as a potential therapeutic target. Furthermore, XRCC1 was overexpressed in BRCAX patients; consequently, we suggest to test the effectiveness of inhibitors targeting two different BER components in preclinical studies. XRCC1, which is also involved in the non-homologous end-joining pathway, was found to be downregulated in BRCA2-related patients concurrently with no change in PARP1 expression. Interestingly, no difference in PARP1 and miR17 expression was found in BRCA-related and sporadic breast cancer cases. PARP1 and miR17 could therefore be further investigated as molecular biomarkers of â€˜BRCAness' phenotype, indicating patients which could really benefit from PARP inhibitor therapies.
