 The effects have been examined of chymotrypsin, pepsin, trypsin, and pancreatic lipase on cattle rhodopsin in digitonin solution. The digestion of rhodopsin by chymotrypsin was measured by the hydrolysis of peptide bonds (formol titration), changes in pH, and bleaching. The digestion proceeds in two stages: an initial rapid hydrolysis which exposes about 30 amino groups per molecule, without bleaching; superimposed on a slower hydrolysis which exposes about 50 additional amino groups, with proportionate bleaching. The chymotryptic action begins at pH about 6.0 and increases logarithmically in rate to pH 9.2. Trypsin and pepsin also bleach rhodopsin in solution. A preparation of pancreatic lipase bleached it slightly, but no more than could be explained by contamination with proteases. In digitonin solution each rhodopsin molecule is associated in a micelle with about 200 molecules of digitonin; yet the latter do not appear to hinder enzyme action. It is suggested that the digitonin sheath is sufficiently fluid to be penetrated on collision with an enzyme molecule; and that once together the enzyme and substrate are held together by intermolecular attractive forces, and by the "cage effect" of bombardment by surrounding solvent molecules. The two stages of chymotryptic digestion of rhodopsin may correspond to an initial rapid fragmentation, such as has been observed with many proteinases and substrates; superimposed upon a slower digestion of the fragments. Since the first phase involves no bleaching, this may mean that rhodopsin can be broken into considerably smaller fragments without loss of optical properties.
