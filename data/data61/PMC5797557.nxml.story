In search of improved risk stratification in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), CMR imaging has been implicated as a potential tool for prediction of sudden cardiac death (SCD). In follow-up of the promising results with extensive late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), high signal-intensity on T2-weighted imaging (HighT2) has become subject of interest given its association with markers of adverse disease progression, such as LGE, elevated troponin and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. In lack of follow-up cohorts, we initiated an exploratory study on the association between HighT2 and the internationally defined risk categories of SCD. In a cohort of 109 HCM patients from a multicenter study on CMR imaging and biomarkers, we estimated the 5-year SCD risk (HCM Risk-SCD model). Patients were categorized as low (< 4%), intermediate (≥ 4–<6%) or high (≥ 6%) risk. In addition, risk categorization according to the ACC/AHA guidelines was performed. HighT2 was present in 27% (29/109). Patients with HighT2 were more often at an intermediate-high risk of SCD according to the European (28 vs. 10%, p = .032) and American guidelines (41 vs. 18%, p = .010) compared to those without HighT2. The estimated 5-year SCD risk of our cohort was 1.9% (IQR 1.3–2.9%), and projected SCD rates were higher in patients with than without HighT2 (2.8 vs. 1.8%, p = .002). In conclusion, HCM patients with HighT2 were more likely to be intermediate-high risk, with projected SCD rates that were 1.5 fold higher than in patients without HighT2. These pilot findings call for corroborative studies with more intermediate-high risk HCM patients and clinical follow-up to assess whether HighT2 may have additional value to current risk stratification.
