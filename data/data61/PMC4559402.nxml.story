Maintaining a constant body temperature is crucial to the survival of many species, including mammals such as rodents. Temperature regulation can be achieved via internal physiological processes and by seeking warmth when cold or cold when hot, as, for example, when young rats and mice exchange body heat by huddling together. Huddling is considered by many to be an important example of self-organisation, where a complex and adaptive group behaviour emerges from simple interactions between individuals behaving without plan or instruction. However, it is difficult to rule out the possibility that a complex group behaviour is the result of equally complex individual behaviours. Our approach is therefore to determine the simplest set of rules of interaction from which group-level huddling can emerge. Recent experiments have shown that huddling switches on at low temperatures, and that individuals continually exchange positions from the cool periphery of the huddle to its warm core. We show in computer simulations that both group behaviours emerge spontaneously when individuals simply turn towards sources of preferred temperature whilst continually generating, losing, and exchanging heat. A mathematical model of the simulation results suggests that individuals together behave as a single organism that continually adapts its exposed surface area to regulate its temperature in a way that no individual can. We therefore suggest that thermoregulatory huddling is a true self-organising system, and we derive from the model specific predictions that will enable future experiments to test this theory.
