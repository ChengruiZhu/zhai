Many instrumentation developments in crystallization have concentrated on massive parallelization assays and reduction of sample volume per experiment to find initial crystallization conditions. Yet improving the size and diffraction quality of the crystals for diffraction studies often requires decoupling of crystal nucleation and growth. This in turn requires the control of variables such as precipitant and protein concentration, equilibration rate, and temperature, which are all difficult parameters to control in the existing setups. The success of the temperature-controlled batch method, originally developed to grow very large crystals for neutron crystallography, demonstrated that the rational optimization of crystal growth has potential in structural biology. A temperature-controlled dialysis button has been developed for our previous device, and a prototype of an integrated apparatus for the rational optimization of crystal growth by mapping and manipulating temperatureâ€“precipitant concentration phase diagrams has been constructed. The presented approach differs from the current paradigm, since it involves serial instead of parallel experiments, exploring multiple crystallization conditions with the same protein sample. The sample is not consumed in the experiment and the conditions can be changed in a reversible fashion, using dialysis with a flowing precipitant reservoir as well as precise temperature control. The control software allows visualization of the crystals, as well as control of the temperature and composition of the crystallization solution. The rational crystallization optimization strategies presented here allow tailoring of crystal size, morphology and diffraction quality, significantly reducing the time, effort and amount of expensive protein material required for structure determination.
