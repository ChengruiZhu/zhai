 Ait., and it is known for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antitumor activities. It has been demonstrated that matrine exerts protective effects against heart failure by decreasing the expression of caspase-3 and Bax, and increasing Bcl-2 levels. In this study, we aimed to determine whether these protective effects of matrine can be applied to cerebral ischemia. Following 7 successive days of treatment with matrine (7.5, 15 and 30 mg/kg) and nimodipine (1 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection, male Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Following reperfusion, the neurobehavioral score and brain infarct volume were estimated, and morphological changes were analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and electron microscopy. The percentage of apoptotic neurons was determined by flow cytometry. The levels of oxidative stress were assessed by measuring the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and catalase (CAT), and the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC). Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining were used to examine the expression of the apoptosis-related proteins, caspase-3, Bax and Bcl-2. Our results revealed that pre-treatment with matrine significantly decreased the infarct volume and improved the neurological scores. Matrine also reduced the percentage of apoptotic neurons and relieved neuronal morphological damage. Furthermore, matrine markedly decreased the MDA levels, and increased SOD, GSH-Px and CAT activity, and T-AOC. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining revealed a marked decrease in caspase-3 expression and an increase in the Bcl-2/Bax ratio in the group pre-treated with matrine (30 mg/kg) as compared with the vehicle-treated group. The findings of the present study demonstrate that matrine exerts neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemic injury and that these effects are associated with its antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties.
