Using lymph node T cells from poly-L(Tyr,Glu)-poly-D,L-Ala--poly-L- Lys[(TG)-A--L]-primed animals and B cells from animals primed with trinitrophenylated (TNP) protein or lipopolysaccharide, we have obtained anti-TNP-(TG)-A--L direct plaque-forming responses in vitro. Response to this antigen was shown to be controlled by the H-2 haplotype of the animal studied. The strain distribution of in vitro response was very similar to that previously reported by others for in vivo secondary IgG responses to (TG)-A--L. We investigated the cell types expressing the Ir gene(s) for (TG)-A--L in our cultures. F1, high responder x low responder mice were primed with (TG)-A--L. Their T cells were active in stimulating anti-TNP-(TG)-A--L responses of high responder but not low responder B cells and macrophages (MPHI), even though both preparations of B cells and Mphi were obtained from mice congenic at H-2 with one of the parents of the F1. For three low responder strains tested, of the H-2h2, H-2k, and H-2f haplotypes, the anti-TNP-(TG)-A--L response of low responder B cells and Mphis in the presence of high responder, F1 T cells could not be improved by the addition of high responder, antigen-bearing Mphis to the cultures. In one strain of the H-2a haplotype, it was shown that neither the B cells nor Mphis could be functional in anti-TNP-(TG)-A--L responses. Our results therefore suggested the Ir genes for anti-TNP-(TG)-A--L responses were expressed at least in B cells in all the low responder strains we studied, and, in mice of the H-2a haplotype, in Mphis too.
