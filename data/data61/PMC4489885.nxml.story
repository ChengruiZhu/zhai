Long interspersed element 1 (LINE-1 or L1) comprises 17% of human genome, and has played a major role in shaping the evolution of human genome. Approximately 100 copies of LINE-1 are still active in an average individual genome. Movement of these LINE-1 sequences to new loci in the genome has the potential of causing sporadic cases of disease. Among the multi-layered mechanisms by which the host controls LINE-1 activity is a group of host restriction factors including APOBEC3 proteins. SAMHD1 was known for the association of its mutations with the Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS), a congenital autoimmune disease. SAMHD1 was recently reported as a host restriction factor that inhibits a number of retroviruses and DNA viruses including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). Here, we demonstrate that SAMHD1 inhibits LINE-1 retrotransposition through promoting the sequestration of LINE-1 RNP within the cytoplasmic stress granules. SAMHD1 promotes the formation of large stress granules by inducing phosphorylation of eIF2Î± and disrupting eIF4A/eIF4G interaction. This is the first report describing the role of SAMHD1 in modulating the formation of stress granules. We envision that this function of SAMHD1 not only contributes to the inhibition of LINE-1, but also the restriction of various viruses.
