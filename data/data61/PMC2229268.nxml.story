The permeation of monovalent cations through the cGMP-gated channel of catfish cone outer segments was examined by measuring permeability and conductance ratios under biionic conditions. For monovalent cations presented on the cytoplasmic side of the channel, the permeability ratios with respect to extracellular Na followed the sequence NH4 > K > Li > Rb = Na > Cs while the conductance ratios at +50 mV followed the sequence Na approximately NH4 > K > Rb > Li = Cs. These patterns are broadly similar to the amphibian rod channel. The symmetry of the channel was tested by presenting the test ion on the extracellular side and using Na as the common reference ion on the cytoplasmic side. Under these biionic conditions, the permeability ratios with respect to Na at the intracellular side followed the sequence NH4 > Li > K > Na > Rb > Cs while the conductance ratios at +50 mV followed the sequence NH4 > K approximately Na > Rb > Li > Cs. Thus, the channel is asymmetric with respect to external and internal cations. Under symmetrical 120 mM ionic conditions, the single-channel conductance at +50 mV ranged from 58 pS in NH4 to 15 pS for Cs and was in the order NH4 > Na > K > Rb > Cs. Unexpectedly, the single-channel current-voltage relation showed sufficient outward rectification to account for the rectification observed in multichannel patches without invoking voltage dependence in gating. The concentration dependence of the reversal potential for K showed that chloride was impermeant. Anomalous mole fraction behavior was not observed, nor, over a limited concentration range, were multiple dissociation constants. An Eyring rate theory model with a single binding site was sufficient to explain these observations.
