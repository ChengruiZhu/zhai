The collective firing of neurons is an essential mechanism for communicating information in the brain. However, in Parkinson’s disease there is a disruption of healthy brain dynamics, which interrupts the processing of normal movement. In particular, the neurons become overly synchronized and produce abnormally large oscillations in their activity. The frequency band of the oscillations associated with the difficulty of movement initiation in primate Parkinson’s disease is in the range of 13–30Hz, which is called the beta band. Understanding the generation of beta oscillations is important to improve treatments for Parkinson’s disease. Competing theories exist for how these oscillations are generated in the affected brain circuits, which include the motor cortex and a set of subcortical nuclei called the basal ganglia. This paper suggests two hypotheses for the generation of beta oscillations. The first hypothesis is that beta oscillations are generated in the motor cortex, and the basal ganglia resonate to the cortical input. The second hypothesis additionally proposes that feedback from the basal ganglia to cortex is critically important for the presence of the oscillations. We show that the models can successfully account for a wide range of experimental data concerning the presence of beta oscillations in Parkinson’s disease.
