A novel, efficient and simple approach for soy phosphatidylcholine analysis according to its fatty acid composition was studied with reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography analysis was performed isocratically using UV detector and simple mobile phase solvents consisting of isopropyl alcohol, methanol, and deionized water in the proportion of 70:8:22 v/v. The uniqueness of the proposed method was the separation of individual fatty acids of soy phosphatidylcholine. The high-performance liquid chromatography method for soy phosphatidylcholine was validated for linearity with correlation coefficient of above 0.99 for all the peaks separated according to their fatty acid composition. The intra-day and the inter-day precision studies provided the relative standard deviation of less than 2%. The limit of detection and limit of quantitation values were also calculated for all the resolved peaks of soy phosphatidylcholine. Also system performance parameters such as number of theoretical plates, capacity factor, tailing factor, separation factor, and peak resolution were studied systematically and found well within the acceptable range. The proposed high-performance liquid chromatography method was successfully applied to soy phosphatidylcholine extracted and purified from deoiled soy lecithin without any interference of impurities or solvent peaks. Individually, the collected peaks of sample soy phosphatidylcholine were subjected for mass spectroscopy. The mass spectra showed all the peaks having different saturated or unsaturated fatty acid chains attached to glyerophosphocholine moiety of soy phosphatidylcholine. The method developed is economic and well suited for estimation of soy phosphatidylcholine with its fatty acid composition.
