Percutaneous transvenous mitral annuloplasty (PTMA) has evolved as a latest procedure for the treatment of functional mitral regurgitation. It reduces mitral valve annulus (MVA) size and increases valve leaflet coaptation via compression of coronary sinus (CS). Anatomical considerations for this procedure were elucidated in the present study. In 40 formalin fixed adult cadaveric human hearts, relation of the venous channel formed by CS and great cardiac vein (GCV) to MVA and the adjacent arteries was described, at 6 points by making longitudinal sections perpendicular to the plane of MVA, numbered 1â€“6 starting from CS ostium. CS/GCV formed a semicircular venous channel on the atrial side of MVA. Based on the distance of CS/GCV from MVA, two patterns were identified. In 37 hearts, the venous channel at point 2 was widely separated from the MVA compared to the two ends and in three hearts a nonconsistent pattern was observed. GCV crossed circumflex artery superficially. GCV or CS crossed the left marginal artery and ventricular branches of circumflex artery superficially in 17 and 23 hearts, respectively. As the venous channel was related more to the left atrial wall, PTMA devices probably exert an indirect traction on MVA. The arteries crossing deep to the venous channel may be compressed by PTMA device leading to myocardial ischemia. Knowledge of the spatial relations of MVA and a preoperative and postoperative angiogram may help to reduce such complications during PTMA.
