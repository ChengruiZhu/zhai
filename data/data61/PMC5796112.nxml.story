The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are known as both synaptic receptors and taste receptors. This feature is highly similar to the Property and Flavor theory of Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which has the pharmacological effect and flavor. In this study, six ligand based pharmacophore (LBP) models, seven homology modeling models, and fourteen molecular docking models of mGluRs were built based on orthosteric and allosteric sites to screening potential compounds from Traditional Chinese Medicine Database (TCMD). Based on the Pharmacopoeia of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China, TCMs of compounds and their flavors were traced and listed. According to the tracing result, we found that the TCMs of the compounds which bound to orthosteric sites of mGluRs are highly correlated to a sweet flavor, while the allosteric site corresponds to a bitter flavor. Meanwhile, the pharmacological effects of TCMs with highly frequent flavors were further analyzed. We found that those TCMs play a neuroprotective role through the efficiencies of detumescence, promoting blood circulation, analgesic effect, and so on. This study provides a guide for developing new neuroprotective drugs from TCMs which target mGluRs. Moreover, it is the first study to present a novel approach to discuss the association relationship between flavor and the neuroprotective mechanism of TCM based on mGluRs.
