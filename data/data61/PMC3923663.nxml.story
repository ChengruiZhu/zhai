During development, morphogen gradients play a crucial role in transforming a uniform field of cells into regions with distinct cell identities (marked by the expression of specific genes). Finding mechanisms that convert morphogen gradients into sharp borders of gene expression, however, remains a challenge. Cellular ultrasensitivity mechanisms that convert a linear stimulus into an on-off target response offer a good solution for making such borders. In this paper, we show how a cross-inhibitory positive feedback or toggle switch mechanism driven by two extracellular morphogens – BMP and FGF - produces ultrasensitivity in forebrain cells. Experiments with cells and explanted brain tissue reveal that BMPs and FGFs cross inhibit each other's signaling pathway. Such cross inhibition could occur through four possible mechanisms. By an iterative combination of modeling and experiment, we show the toggle switch to be the mechanism underlying cross inhibition, the ultrasensitive expression of multiple genes, and hysteresis in forebrain cells. As the toggle switch explicitly links extracellular morphogens to cellular ultrasensitivity, it provides a mechanism for making multiple sharp borders that can also scale with tissue size – an important issue in pattern formation. This might explain the abundance of BMP-FGF cross inhibition during development.
