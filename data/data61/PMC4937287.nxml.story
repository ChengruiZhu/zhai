A retrospective chart review was undertaken of all pediatric patients with known or suspected inherited arrhythmia syndromes in whom an ILR was implanted from 2008 to 2015. Captured data included categorization of diagnosis, treatment, transmitted tracings, and the impact of ILR tracings on management. Transmissions were categorized as symptomatic, autotriggered, or routine. Actionable transmissions were abnormal tracings that directly resulted in a change of medical or device therapy. A total of 20 patients met the stated inclusion criteria (long QT syndrome, n=8, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia,n=9, Brugada syndrome, n=1, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, n=2), with 60% of patients being genotype positive. Primary indication for implantation of ILR included ongoing monitoring +/âˆ’ symptoms (n=15, 75%), suspicion of noncompliance (n=1, 5%), and liberalization of recommended activity restrictions (n=4, 25%). A total of 172 transmissions were received in patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes, with 7% yielding actionable data. The majority (52%) of symptom events were documented in the long QT syndrome population, with only 1 tracing (5%) yielding actionable data. Automatic transmissions were mostly seen in the catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia cohort (81%), with 21% yielding actionable data. There was no actionable data in routine transmissions.
