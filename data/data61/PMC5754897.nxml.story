This study aimed to investigate the correlation between the expression of CD24 and B7-H3 in breast cancer tissues and the clinical significance. Expression of CD24 and B7-H3 in breast cancer and adjacent tissues were detected by immunohistochemistry. Quantitative PCR was used to detect the expression of CD24 and B7-H3 mRNA in breast cancer and adjacent tissues. The expression of CD24 and B7-H3 protein in breast cancer and adjacent tissues was detected by immunoblotting. The correlation between the expression levels of the two proteins was analyzed and the relationship between the expression of two proteins and the 5-year survival of breast cancer patients was investigated. CD24 and B7-H3 were positively expressed in breast cancer and adjacent tissues, the CD24-positive rate was 75.7 and 25.7%, respectively, and the B7-H3-positive rate was 56.8 and 43.2%, respectively, and the differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). The expression of CD24 was positively correlated with the expression of B7-H3 (Spearman's correlation coefficient r, 0.297; p=0.036). The positive and negative expression of CD24 and B7-H3 significantly affected the 5-year survival of breast cancer patients (P<0.05). Quantitative PCR results showed that the expression levels of CD24 and B7-H3 mRNA in breast cancer tissues were significantly higher than those in adjacent tissues (P<0.05). The expression levels of CD24 and B7-H3 protein in breast cancer tissues were also significantly higher than those in adjacent tissues (P<0.05). CD24 and B7-H3 were highly expressed in breast cancer, suggesting that both CD24 and B7-H3 were related to the development of breast cancer. Five-year survival analysis of breast cancer patients showed that the high expression of CD24 and B7-H3 were correlated with the poor prognosis of patients. Thus, CD24 and B7-H3 may become new targets for the treatment of breast cancer.
