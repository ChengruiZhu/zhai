 Simultaneous transfers to the testes of normal rabbits of circulating blood, heart muscle, liver, brain, spleen and bone marrow (mixed), inoculated testicle, and popliteal lymph nodes from a series of untreated syphilitic rabbits, demonstrated the persistence of the original infection unifomnly in the lymph nodes and less regularly in the liver, mixed spleen and bone marrow, and testis originally inoculated. In one instance the circulating blood was found to be infectious. Transfer of similar tissues from syphilitic rabbits treated with arsphenamine late in the course of the disease failed to disclose syphilitic infection of any of these tissues. In one animal, in which keratitis developed both before and after treatment, the blood, internal organs, and lymph nodes were found to be non-infectious in spite of the fact that the cornea was shown to be the site of a syphilitic inflammation. Transfer of lymph nodes or internal organs of treated syphilitic rabbits is probably the best method of evaluating an antisyphilitic agent, but it must be supplemented by careful observation of treated animals over an appreciable interval of time following treatment. The results of this study support the idea that failure to reinoculate a treated syphilitic animal does not necessarily mean the existence of the first infection but might beinterpreted as indicating the presence of an acquired resistance which persists in rabbits in which no trace of the first infection can be demonstrated.
