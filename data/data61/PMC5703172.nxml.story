Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is exceptionally deadly because the tumors lack sensitive early-stage diagnostic biomarkers and are resistant to radiation and chemotherapy. Here, we investigated the role and mechanism of Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) in NSCLC radioresistance. The clinical data showed that the RKIP expression level was generally lower in radioresistant NSCLC tissues than in radiosensitive tissues. Reduced RKIP expression was related to NSCLC radioresistance and poor prognosis. In vitro experiments showed that RKIP knockdown increased radioresistance and metastatic ability in NSCLC cell lines. Mechanistically, RKIP reduction activated the Shh signaling pathway by derepressing Smoothened (Smo) and initiating glioma-associated oncogene-1 (Gli1)-mediated transcription in NSCLC. In addition, the inappropriately activated Shhâ€“Gli1 signaling pathway then enhanced cancer stem cell (CSC) expression in the cell lines. The increasing quantity of CSCs in the tumor ultimately promotes the radiation resistance of NSCLC. Together, these results suggest that RKIP plays a vital role in radiation response and metastasis in NSCLC. RKIP reduction enhances radioresistance by activating the Shh signaling pathway and initiating functional CSCs. This role makes it a promising therapeutic target for improving the efficacy of NSCLC radiation treatment.
