Maintaining genome integrity is crucial for all organisms, and failure to do so can lead to fatal diseases such as cancer. Exposure to challenging environments can induce DNA strand breaks or other lesions; thus, rapid and appropriate DNA damage responses (DDRs) need to be in place to detect and repair the damage. Cellular networks use a variety of signaling molecules and post-translational modifications that are crucial for the signaling of DNA breaks to repair machineries. Poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) and activation of the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is a post-translational modification that occurs within seconds upon DNA damage detection and triggers downstream DDR signaling; however, it remains obscure whether other molecules, beyond DNA strand breaks, stimulate or control PARP1 activity. We report here that a novel DDR signaling molecule, Src-associated substrate during mitosis of 68 kDa (Sam68), has a crucial function in governing the DNA damage-initiated PARP1 activation and polymers of ADP-ribose (PAR) production. We show that Sam68 is recruited to and significantly overlaps with PARP1 at DNA lesions and that the Sam68-PARP1 interaction is critical for DNA damage-initiated PARP1 activation and PAR production both in vitro and in vivo. Sam68-deleted cells and animals have a diminished PAR-dependent DNA repair signaling and are hypersensitive to genotoxicity caused by DNA-damaging agents. Hence, our data reveal an unexpected function for Sam68 in DNA damage-initiated early signaling and provide a novel mechanism on the activation and regulation of PARP1 in DDR.
