. Herein, we examined its underlying mechanism and antitumor activity associated with vascular remodeling. RLYE inhibited VEGF-A-induced angiogenesis in a mouse model and suppressed VEGF-A-induced angiogenic signal cascades in human endothelial cells. However, RLYE showed no inhibitory effect on VEGF-A-induced proliferation and migration of multiple myeloma cells expressing VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-1, but not VEGFR-2. In addition, RLYE showed no inhibitory effect on angiogenic activities induced by VEGF-B, basic fibroblast growth factor, epithermal growth factor, sphingosine-1-phosphate, and placental growth factor. RLYE bound specifically to VEGFR-2 at the VEGF-A binding site, thereby blocking VEGF-A-VEGFR-2 binding and VEGF-A-induced VEGFR-2 internalization. The RLYE peptide inhibited tumor growth and metastasis via suppression of tumor angiogenesis in tumor-bearing mice. Moreover, RLYE showed a synergistic effect of the cytotoxic agent irinotecan on tumor cell apoptosis and tumor progression via tumor vessel normalization due to stabilization of VE-cadherin-mediated adherens junction, improvement of pericyte coverage, and inhibition of vascular leakage in tumors. Our results suggest that RLYE can be used as an antiangiogenic and tumor blood vessel remodeling agent for inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis by antagonizing VEGFR-2, with the synergistic anti-cancer effect via enhancement of drug delivery and therapeutic efficacy.
