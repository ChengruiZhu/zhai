 = 10). Clinical investigations included serum creatinine, phosphate and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, echocardiography, and multislice computed tomography. Pathological examinations of the valves included histological characterization, Von Kossa staining, and antigen and gene expression analyses. Eight diet group rats were further assessed for reversibility of valve calcification following normalization of their kidney function. At 4 weeks, all diet group rats developed renal failure and hyperparathyroidism. At week 9, renal failure resolved with improvement in the hyperparathyroid state. Echocardiography demonstrated valve calcifications only in diet group rats. Tomographic calcium scores were significantly higher in the diet group compared with controls. Von Kossa stain in diet group valves revealed calcium deposits, positive staining for osteopontin, and CD68. Gene expression analyses revealed overexpression of osteoblast genes and nuclear factor ÎºB activation. Valve calcification resolved after diet cessation in parallel with normalization of PTH levels. Resolution was associated with down-regulation of inflammation and osteoblastic features. Low-phosphate group rats developed kidney dysfunction similar to that of the diet group but with normal levels of PTH. Calcium scores and histology showed only minimal valve calcification.
