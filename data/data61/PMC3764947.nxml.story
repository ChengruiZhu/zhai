Pancreatic fistula is a known complication of distal pancreatectomy. Endotherapy with pancreatic duct stent placement and pancreatic sphincterotomy has been shown to be effective in its management; however, experience of endotherapy in the management of this complication has not been extensively reported from the United States. Preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with pancreatic stent placement has also been proposed to prevent this complication after distal pancreatectomy. In our cohort of 59 patients who underwent distal pancreatectomy, 13 (22%) developed a pancreatic fistula in the immediate postoperative period, of whom 8 (14%) patients (5 female, mean age 52 years) were referred for an ERCP because of ongoing symptoms related to the pancreatic fistula. The pancreatic fistula resolved in all patients after a median duration of 62 days from the index ERCP. The median number of ERCPs required to document resolution of the pancreatic fistula was 2. Although a sizeable percentage of patients develop a pancreatic fistula after distal pancreatectomy, only a small percentage of patients require ERCP for management of this complication. Given the high success rate of endotherapy in resolving pancreatic fistula and the fact that the majority of patients who undergo distal pancreatectomy never require an ERCP, performing ERCP for prophylactic pancreatic duct stent prior to distal pancreatectomy might not be necessary.
