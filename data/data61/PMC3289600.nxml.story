Most cell types in an organism are generated from embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which are able to proliferate an unlimited number of times and have the potential to produce any kind of cell of that organism (this ability is called pluripotency). In order to maintain these properties, ESCs have to remain in a proliferate state, which is achieved by the collaboration of several factors. Expressing combinations of these factors in differentiated cells can result in ESC-like qualities; these induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can then function like ESCs. Previous studies suggested that p53, generally known for its roles in maintaining genomic integrity by regulating cell cycle and cell death pathways, also acts as a barrier to reprogramming adult cells during the creation of iPSCs; whether this is strictly due to repression of proliferation remains a subject of debate. Here, we show that p53 plays a significant role in actively promoting differentiation of human ESCs (hESCs). We find that, prior to differentiation, p53 is expressed at very low levels in hESCs, held in check by two negative regulators, HDM2 and TRIM24, that trigger p53 degradation. Upon induction of differentiation, lysine 373 of p53 is acetylated, and this disrupts the existing interactions with negative regulators, thus allowing stabilization and activation of p53. Active p53 in turn promotes expression of the cell cycle regulator p21 to slow down the hESC cell cycle; cells in the gap (G
