There is much debate around the preoperative treatment of colorectal cancer and, in particular, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer. This treatment carries a significant risk of harmful side effects and has a highly variable response rate. Predictive biomarkers have been the subject of a great deal of study with the aim of pretreatment risk stratification in order to more accurately determine which patients will derive the most benefit and least harm from these treatments. The study of epigenetics in colorectal cancer is relatively recent, and distinct patterns of aberrant DNA methylation, in particular the cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) island methylator phenotype (CIMP), have been demonstrated in colorectal cancer, and their characterisation and significance are under debate, particularly in rectal cancer. These patterns of DNA methylation have been associated with differences in response to therapy and treatment outcomes and therefore have the potential to be used as biomarkers in tailored therapy regimes for patients with rectal cancer. This review aims to summarise the current state of the art in rectal cancer, with particular regard to the determination of DNA methylation patterns, the CpG island methylator phenotype and its potential as a novel biomarker in rectal cancer treatment and prediction of outcomes and response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.
