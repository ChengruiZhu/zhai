A total of 34,532 injuries in boysâ€™ football, ice hockey, and lacrosse occurred during 9,078,902 exposures for a rate of 3.80 injuries per 1,000 AE in the three contact sports of interest. The rate of injury was found to be higher in competition compared to practice for all three sports, with the largest difference in ice hockey (RR = 8.28; 95% CI = 7.74-8.86). In football, 46.6% of injuries were due to tackling or being tackled, 41.1% of injuries in ice hockey and 15.3% of injuries in lacrosse were due to checking or being checked. In football and lacrosse, a greater percentage of injuries were due to being tackled or checked, respectively. Similarly, in ice hockey, a greater percentage of injuries occurred due to being checked compared to checking, but surprisingly the proportion was much higher (81.6% vs 18.4%). In addition, a smaller proportion of hockey athletes injured while being checked were able to return to play in less than a week compared with both being tackled in football (IPR = 0.41) and being checked in lacrosse (IPR = 0.47). A significantly greater proportion of concussions sustained in football were the result of tackling compared to being tackled (28.3% vs 24.8%; IPR = 1.17; 95% CI = 1.11-1.24). Conversely, in ice hockey, a greater proportion of concussions were sustained while being checked compared to checking (33.8% vs. 20.5%; IPR = 1.65; 95% CI = 1.04-2.61). There was a significantly higher concussion rate in competition compared to practice for all three sports with no concussions sustained in ice hockey practice due to checking.
