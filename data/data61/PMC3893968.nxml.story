The main aim of the study was to assess primary health centers (PHCs) in terms of availability of assured services, facility of primary management of selected cases, surgeries, maternal and newborn health care services, and child health care services with respect to Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS). Data were collected from service providers (medical officerin-charge) at PHCs through well-structured questionnaire developed by referring the IPHS for PHCs prescribed by the Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. The study was conducted at five districts (i.e. Bundi, SawaiMadhopur, Kota, Tonk, and Karauli) of Rajasthan state of India. All 148 PHCs of these five districts were included in the study. Findings depict that more than 90% of the study PHCs showed availability of services such as outpatient department (OPD), antenatal check up (ANC), postnatal check up (PNC), management of reproductive tract infections/sexual transmitted infection (RTI/STI), immunization, and treatment of diarrhea. However, services such as emergency services (24 h), primary management of fractures, surgery of cataract, medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) services, management of low-birth-weight babies, facility for tubectomy and vasectomy, and facility for internal examination for gynecological conditions were poor at PHCs of the study districts, which need to be addressed for further strengthening of primary health centers.
