Quadriceps and Hamstrings strengths significantly increased over time for both involved (Quadriceps: F (2,46)=58.3, p<0.001, Hamstring: F (2,46)=35.7, p<0.001) and uninvolved limb (Quadriceps: F(2,46)=17.9, p<0.001, Hamstring: F(2,46)=56.9, p=0.001 ). Quadriceps strength was higher at 12th week when compared to the 8 and 4 week time points for the involved limb (p<0.001), and it was higher at 8th week when compared to 4 week time point for the involved limb (p<0.001). For the uninvolved limb, quadriceps strength was also higher at 12th week when compared to the 8 (p=0.02) and 4 week time point (p<0.001), and higher at 8 week when compared to the 4 week time point (p=0.02). Hamstring strength was higher at 12 week when compared to the 8 and 4 week time points (p<0.001) and it was higher at 8 week when compared to 4 week time point for the involved limb (p<0.001). For the uninvolved limb hamstring strength was also higher at 12 week when compared to 4 week time point (p=0.01). There was no significant difference between the 4 and 8 week time points (p>0.05) or between the 8 and 12 week time points (p=0.07). Quadriceps and hamstring indexes significantly changed from 4th weeks (QI:57.9, HI:54.4 ) to 8th weeks (QI:78.8, HI:69.9 ) and from 8th weeks to 12th weeks (QI:82, HI:75.7 ) (p<0.001); however, there was no difference between indexes at the 12-week time point (p=0.17).
