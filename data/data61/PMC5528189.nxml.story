Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are cationic channels of the neuronal cell membrane, differentially expressed in the central nervous system which, when activated by endogenous acetylcholine or exogenous nicotine, are able to enhance cholinergic transmission. The aim of this study was to investigate in human perinatal age the immunohistochemical expression of the α7-nAChR subtype, given its involvement in neuronal differentiation and its significant vulnerability to the toxic effects of nicotine. Thirty fetuses (with a gestational age between 25 and 40 weeks) and 35 infants (1–6 months old), suddenly died of known (controls) and unknown causes (unexplained deaths), with smoking and nonsmoking mothers, were included in this study. A negative or low immunoexpression of α7-nAChRs, indicative of their inactivation, was observed in the granular layers of the cerebellar cortex in 66% of the sudden unexplained perinatal deaths and 11% of the controls. A high correlation was also observed between these findings and maternal smoking. Apart from the well-known adverse effects of nicotine exposure during pregnancy, it may also cause significant alterations in cerebellar cholinergic transmission in areas of the brain involved in vital functions. These events may give us insights into the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to sudden unexplained fetal and infant death.
