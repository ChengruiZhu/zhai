A total of 759 females born before 2001, diagnosed with perinatally acquired HIV aged ≤13 years, and in care in the UK and Ireland have been reported. Forty-four of these (6%) have had at least one pregnancy reported, with nineteen 2nd and four 3rd/4th pregnancies. Women's year of birth ranged from 1985 to 1996; 60% of women were UK/Irish-born and 39% African-born. Twenty one percent were diagnosed at <2 years, 39% at 2–7 and 41% at 8–13 years. Nine pregnancies were conceived in 2005–07, 22 in 2008–10 and 36 in 2011–13. Median age at conception of first pregnancy was 19 years. CD4 count was >500 cells/µL in 36% of first pregnancies, 350–499 in 15% and <350 in 49%. Women were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) at conception in 71% of pregnancies. There were 51 singleton live births, 2 miscarriages, 9 terminations and 5 continuing to term. In 17 live births to women not on ART at conception, median gestational age at start of ART was 17 weeks (range 3–29). HIV viral load was <50 copies/mL near delivery in 64% of live births, 51–1000 in 31% and >1000 in 5%. Forty four percent of live births were delivered by elective caesarean section (CS), 27% by emergency CS, 27% by planned vaginal delivery and with one unplanned vaginal delivery. Of 29 live births with viral load <50, 31% were delivered by elective CS, 17% by emergency CS and 52% by vaginal delivery. Fifteen percent of infants were delivered at 32–36 weeks gestation, and 2% at 30 weeks; 16% weighed 1.5–2.5 kg and 16% weighed <1.5 kg. Among 38 of the 51 infants where infection status is already reported, one is perinatally infected.
