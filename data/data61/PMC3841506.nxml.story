Non-depleting antibody induction has the best safety profile in transplant recipients without an increased risk of infection or malignancy. This observational study was performed in intermediate immunologic risk live donor renal transplants to assess basiliximab efficacy in patients on tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisolone immunosuppression. A total of 46 patients on basiliximab induction were compared to risk matched 56 controls at the end of 6 and 12 months post-transplant. An additional cost of approximately Rs. 100,000/patient was incurred by the basiliximab group. The incidence of biopsy proven acute rejection in the control group (12.5%, 6 months and 20.5%, 1 year) and the basiliximab group (13%, 6 months and 18.9%, 1 year) was similar. At 6 months, there was a non-significant trend toward more steroid sensitive rejections and better glomerular filtration rate preservation in the basiliximab group (83.3%, 71.9 ml/min) versus the control group (28.6%, 62.2 ml/min). However, this difference was lost at 1 year (70.1 ml/min vs. 67.6 ml/min). The incidence of infections was similar and none of the patients had a malignancy. Death censored graft survival (94.6% basiliximab and 94.8% control) and the mean number of hospitalizations for all reasons at the end of 1 year were not different among the two groups. In our study, basiliximab induction did not confer an additional advantage in the intermediate risk live donor transplants in patients on tacrolimus and mycophenolate based triple drug immunosuppression.
