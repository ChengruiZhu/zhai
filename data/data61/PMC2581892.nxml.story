Use-dependent downregulation of neuronal excitability (negative feedback) can act to maintain neuronal activity within specified levels. Disruption of this homeostasis can lead to neurological disorders, such as epilepsy. Here, we report a novel mechanism for negative feedback control of excitability in the Drosophila larval motor neuron. In this mechanism, activation by the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) located at motor nerve terminals decreases excitability by activating PI3 kinase (PI3K), consequently causing the phosphorylation and inhibition of the transcription factor Foxo. Foxo inhibition, in turn, decreases neuronal excitability. These observations are of interest for two reasons. First, our observation that PI3K activity regulates neuronal excitability is of interest because altered PI3K activity is implicated in a number of neurological disorders, such as autism and neurofibromatosis. Our results raise the possibility that altered excitability might contribute to the deficits in these disorders. Second, our observation that group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) activate PI3K is of interest because group II mGluRs are implicated in epilepsy, anxiety disorders, and schizophrenia. Yet the downstream signaling pathways affected by these treatments are incompletely understood. Our results raise the possibility that the PI3K pathway might be an essential mediator of signalling by these mGluRs.
