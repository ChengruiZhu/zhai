A long-standing challenge in biology is to unravel the chain of molecular events linking genetic variation to phenotypes like disease. Identifying the genes that act as intermediates between the underlying genetic variation and the disease can offer new ways to intervene in its progression. While large-scale molecular profiles are an important starting point, it is difficult to distinguish causal relationships from correlative associations. In this study, our goal was to develop strategies to identify these causal intermediates. We studied the effects of genetic differences in baker's yeast on fitness in multiple environmental conditions. While genetic effects on fitness depended strongly on the environment, genetic effects on the expression of truly causal intermediate genes tended to persist despite environmental changes. This indicates that causal intermediates can be found among genes whose expression is affected by genetic variation independently of environment. We thus developed a statistical method to predict causal intermediates based on genetics, gene expression, and fitness in multiple environments. Our study has implications for the design and analysis of clinical molecular profiling efforts towards understanding how genetic variation causes disease, suggesting that multiple contexts (e.g., cell types) can be informative even if they are not afflicted by the disease.
