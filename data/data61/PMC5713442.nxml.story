The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of antioxidants rich red palm oil (RPO) supplementation on cardiac oxidative stress known as crucial factor deteriorating heart function in hypertension. 3-month-old, male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) were fed standard rat chow without or with RPO (0.2 mL/day/5 weeks). General characteristic of rats were registered. Left ventricular tissue (LV) was used to determine expression of superoxide dismutases (SOD1, SOD2) and glutathione peroxidases (Gpx) as well as activity of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Functional parameters of the heart were examined during basal conditions and at the early-phase of post-ischemic reperfusion using Langendorff-perfused system. RPO intake significantly reduced elevated blood pressure and total NOS activity as well as increased lowered expression of mitochondrial SOD2 in SHR hearts during basal condition. Moreover, RPO supplementation resulted in suppression of elevated heart rate, increase of reduced coronary flow and enhancement of systolic and diastolic heart function at the early-phase of post-ischemic reperfusion. It is concluded that SHR benefit from RPO intake due to decrease of blood pressure, amelioration of oxidative stress and protection of heart function that was deteriorated by post-ischemic reperfusion.
