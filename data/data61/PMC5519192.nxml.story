 (DCIS) and invasive breast carcinoma (IBC). PRH/HHEX (proline-rich homeodomain/haematopoietically expressed homeobox) is a transcription factor that displays both tumour suppressor and oncogenic activity in different disease contexts; however, the role of PRH in breast cancer is poorly understood. Here we show that nuclear localization of the PRH protein is decreased in DCIS and IBC compared with normal breast. Our previous work has shown that PRH phosphorylation by protein kinase CK2 prevents PRH from binding to DNA and regulating the transcription of multiple genes encoding growth factors and growth factor receptors. Here we show that transcriptionally inactive phosphorylated PRH is elevated in DCIS and IBC compared with normal breast. To determine the consequences of PRH loss of function in breast cancer cells, we generated inducible PRH depletion in MCF-7 cells. We show that PRH depletion results in increased MCF-7 cell proliferation in part at least due to increased vascular endothelial growth factor signalling. Moreover, we demonstrate that PRH depletion increases the formation of breast cancer cells with cancer stem cell-like properties. Finally, and in keeping with these findings, we show that PRH overexpression inhibits the growth of mammary tumours in mice. Collectively, these data indicate that PRH plays a tumour suppressive role in the breast and they provide an explanation for the finding that low PRH mRNA levels are associated with a poor prognosis in breast cancer.
