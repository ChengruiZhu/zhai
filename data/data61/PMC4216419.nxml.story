The sensitivity of RNFL was 90,0%, specificity 82,0 %, positive predictability 83,3 % and negative predictability was 89,1 %. The total accuracy was 86,0 % and area under curve (AUC) was 0,878 for RNFL indeks compering early to developed glaucoma. The sensitivity for CUP was 78%, the specificity was 80,8 %, the positive predictability 81,2% and the negative predictability was 77,5 %. The total accuracy was 79,3 % and area under curve (AUC) was 0,86 compering early to developed glaucoma. The sensitivity for E/D was 82,0%, the specificity was 82,9 % the positive predictability 83,7 % and the negative predictability was 81,3 %. The total accuracy was 82,5 % and area under curve (AUC) for E/D was 0,89 compering eearly to developed glaucoma. The sensitivity for RIM was 78,0%, the specificity was 76,6 %, the positive predictability was 84,7 and the negative predictability was 67,7 %. The total accuracy was 77,5 % and area under curve (AUC) for the RIM compering the developed to terminal glaucoma was 0,792. The sensitivity of RNFL was 88,0 %, the specificity was 66,7 %, the positive predictability was 81,5% and the negative predictability was 76,9%. The total accuracy was 80,0% and the area under curve (AUC) for RNFL compering developed to terminal glaucoma was 0,815. The incrreasing 0,1 unit RNFL decreases the risk of developing glaucoma from early to another developed stage of glaucoma for 6,95%. The increasing of E/D for only one unit increases the risk to develop another stage of glaucoma for 18,75 times. The increasing of RNFL for only one unit decreases the risk of performing developed glaucoma from initial stage for 7,8%. The increasing for only one unit of CUP increases the risk to develop terminal glaucoma for 8,47 times and increasing for 0,1 unit of the value of RIM decreases the risk developing terminal glaucoma for 9,27%. The increasing for 0,01 unit of the E/D index increases the risk for terminal glaucoma for 23,23 times. The increasing for one unit of RNFL decreasing the risk developing terminal glaucoma for 5,7%.
