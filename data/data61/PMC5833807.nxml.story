Erlotinib resistance causes a high degree of lethality in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The high expression and activation of several receptor tyrosine kinases, such as JAK/STAT3, c-Met, and EGFR, play important roles in drug resistance. The development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors is urgently required in the clinic. Our previous study found that Gambogenic acid (GNA), a small molecule derived from the traditional Chinese medicine herb gamboge, induced cell death in several NSCLC cell lines through JAK/STAT3 inhibition. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of action of GNA in erlotinib-resistant NSCLC and patient-derived cells. The inhibition of GNA on FGFR signaling pathway was examined using biochemical kinase assays. NSCLC cell lines (HCC827, HCC827-Erlotinib-resistant, and H1650) and primary cells from patients with NSCLC with clinical resistance to erlotinib were treated with GNA, erlotinib, or their combination. Both kinase assays and cell- based assays showed that GNA inhibits the phosphorylation of multiple kinases in FGFR signaling pathway in NSCLC. The combination of GNA and erlotinib significantly attenuates the tumor growth of HCC827 and erlotinib-resistant HCC827 xenografts with low toxicity. Importantly, GNA significantly suppresses tumor growth in a lung patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model with FGFR fusion and low EGFR expression. Our findings provide preclinical evidence for using GNA as an FGFR signaling pathway inhibitor to overcome erlotinib resistance in NSCLC treatment or to enhance erlotinib efficacy when used as a combined administration.
