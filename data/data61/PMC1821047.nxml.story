The huge growth in sequence databases allows the characterization of every protein sequence by comparison with its relatives. Sequence comparisons can reveal both the key conserved functional motifs that define protein families and the variations specific to individual subfamilies, thus decorating any protein sequence with its evolutionary context. Inspired by the massive sequence trove from the Global Ocean Survey project, the authors looked in depth at the protein kinase–like (PKL) superfamily. Eukaryotic protein kinases (ePKs) are the pre-eminent controllers of eukaryotic cell biology and among the best studied of enzymes. By contrast, their prokaryotic relatives are much more poorly known. The authors hoped to both characterize and better understand these prokaryotic enzymes, and also, by contrast, provide insight into the core mechanisms of the eukaryotic protein kinases. The authors used remote homology methods, and bootstrapped on their discoveries to detect more than 45,000 PKL sequences. These clustered into 20 major families, of which the ePKs were just one. Ten residues are conserved between these families: 6 were known to be important in catalysis, but four more—including three highly conserved in ePKs—are still poorly understood, despite their ancient conservation. Extensive family-specific features were found, including the surprising loss of all but one of the ten key residues in one family or another. The authors explored some of these losses and found several cases in which changes in one key motif substitute for changes in another, demonstrating the plasticity of these sequences. Similar approaches can be used to better understand any other family of protein sequences.
