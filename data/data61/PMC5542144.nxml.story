A total of 183 adolescent baseball pitchers (14 to 18 years old) participated after providing written informed consents approved by the hospital’s institutional review board. The procedures to be performed were also explained to their parent(s). Each participant was not currently injured or recovering from an injury at time of testing.For data collection, a set of 14-mm spherical reflective markers was placed on the skin overlying 34 anatomical landmarks. Subsequently, the motion capture automatic digitizing system was used to collect 500-Hz from 7 synchronized cameras was set up around the regulation pitching mound in an indoor laboratory. After stretching and warm-up pitching, each player pitch to 5 fastball pitches. Then, the best pitch thrown for a strike was chosen for kinematic and kinetic analysis.The local coordinate systems were used to calculate 3-dimesional rotation at the shoulder using the typical Eulerian sequence. The standard inverse dynamic equation was used to estimate resultant joint force at throwing shoulder. In order to normalize data between subjects, force was expressed as percent using body weight.To estimate the optimal shoulder orientation at ball release, Rz was defined a shoulder abduction angle, which indicated zero value of shoulder superior/inferior force at ball release by linear regression analysis. Similarly-defined Ry was a shoulder horizontal adduction/abduction angle, which indicated zero value of shoulder anterior/posterior force. Afterward, 2 groups with consideration for variations of shoulder orientations at ball release were created: {A- < Rz - 5, Rz - 5 ≤ A ≤ Rz + 5, Rz + 5 < A+}, {B- < Ry - 5, Ry - 5 ≤ B ≤ Ry + 5, Ry + 5 < B+}. Because shoulder range of motion is generally measured 5 degrees intervals in the orthopaedics. Then, we employed MANOVA to investigate significant differences of averages of inferior/superior and anterior/posterior forces applied to the shoulder at ball release among 2 groups respectively.
