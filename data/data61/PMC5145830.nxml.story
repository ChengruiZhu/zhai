Distraction osteogenesis biologically resembles fracture healing with distinctive characteristics notably in the distraction phase of osteogenesis. In the latency phase of bone lengthening, like in the inflammatory phase of fracture repair, interleukines are released and act with growth factors released from platelets in the local haematoma, leading to attraction, proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into osteoblasts and other differentiated mesenchymal cells. These in turn produce matrix, collagen fibers and growth factors. A callus containing cells, collagen fibers, osteoid and cartilage matrix is formed. Provided stable fixation, distraction will trigger intramembranous bone formation. As distraction proceeds, the distraction gap develops five distinctive zones with unmineralized bone in the middle, remodelling bone peripherally, and mineralizing bone in between. During consolidation, the high concentration of anabolic growth factors in the regenerate diminishes with time as remodelling takes over to form mature cortical and cancellous bone. Systemic disease, congenital bone deficiencies, medications and substance abuse can influence the quality and quantity of regenerate bone, usually in a negative way. The regenerate bone can be manipulated when needed by using injection of mesenchymal stem cells and platelets, growth factors (BMP-2 and -7), and systemic medications (bisphosphonates and parathyroid hormone). Growth factors and systemic anabolic and antiresorptive drugs are prescribed on special indications, while distraction osteogenesis is not an authorized indication. To some extent, however, these compounds can be used off-label. Use in children presents special problems since growth factors and specific anabolic medications may involve a risk of inducing cancer.
