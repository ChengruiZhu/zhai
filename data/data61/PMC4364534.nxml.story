Viruses rapidly adapt to environmental changes, complicating our efforts to control the spread of viral infections. Adaptation occurs in two steps: the generation of adaptive variants by random mutations and the subsequent selection of those adaptive variants. High mutation rates in viruses have been well documented; however, little is known about how adaptive variants are rapidly selected, especially given that most viral gene products are shared among viral populations within an infected cell, thereby diluting the direct benefits of each variant. Here we used an RNA virus—tomato mosaic virus—to examine the selection mechanisms hidden in its infection processes. First, we simulated the cell infection process computationally. We found that stochastic behaviors of viral genome molecules result in characteristic patterns of offspring accumulation within cells: (i) predominant replication of offspring from only a handful of founder viral genome molecules in each cell, (ii) variation in the number of offspring originating from each founder, and (iii) variation in the number of founders among cells. We then found that these characteristics enable rapid selection of adaptive variants of the virus during parallel and repeated cell infections, i.e., tissue infections. We speculate that similar selection mechanisms could also be employed by other viruses.
