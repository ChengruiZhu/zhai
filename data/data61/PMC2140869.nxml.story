 1. A method is described for measuring the swelling pressure of solid gelatin. 2. It was found that this pressure increases rapidly between 15° and 37°C., and that the percentage change is nearly independent of the concentration of gelatin. 3. It is suggested that this pressure is due to the osmotic pressure of a soluble constituent of the gelatin held in the network of insoluble fibers, and that gelatin probably consists of a mixture of at least two substances or groups of substances, one of which is soluble in cold water, does not form a gel, and has a low viscosity and a high osmotic pressure. The second is insoluble in cold water, forms a gel in very low concentration, and swells much less than ordinary gelatin. 4. Two fractions, having approximately the above properties, were isolated from gelatin by alcohol precipitation at different temperatures. 5. Increasing the temperature and adding neutral salts greatly increase the pressure of the insoluble fraction and have little effect on that of the soluble fraction. 6. Adding increasing amounts of the soluble fraction to the insoluble one results in greater and greater swelling. 7. These results are considered as evidence for the idea that the swelling of gelatin in water or salt solutions is an osmotic phenomenon, and that gelatin consists of a network of an insoluble substance enclosing a solution of a soluble constituent.
