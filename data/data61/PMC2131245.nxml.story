 In a study of twenty clinical cases with a wide range of diagnoses, repeated total counts of the white cells at 15 minute intervals reveal a large fluctuation at various levels comparable to that found for the normal (1, 2). The granulocytes seem to follow a more or less hourly rhythm, the most marked shift to the left in the Ameth pattern and the moment of greatest percentage of motility coinciding with the peaks. The independence found existing between the peripheral blood concentrations of individual strains of white cells and the red cells, as determined by total and differential counts, their differential response to pathological and pharmacological stimuli, and their normal relative relations, all indicate some separate physiological mechanism of control for each type of cell, either working through, or independently of, their sources of origin. The many factors to which the circulation of the blood, as such, is subject, the complexity of the influences on origin, maturation, delivery, longevity, and destruction of each cell group, the limitations inherent in the present involved, indirect technics of counting, combine to make any single observation subject to grave misinterpretation. The value to the clinician must come in repeated observations, at times when the diagnosis or a therapeutic procedure is in doubt, at frequent intervals, at other times over longer or shorter periods, but always with the relation between consecutive counts, rather than the absolute values, the important point for consideration. Both the red and the white cells probably change their relative concentrations in the peripheral blood from time to time over a considerable range that is quite within normal physiological limits, so that, in theoretical considerations and in practical functional estimations, a zonal concept with adequate individual extremes should always be kept in mind for both physiological and pathological states. A cytological analysis of thirty-two bone marrows from human biopsy and autopsy material shows the striking reciprocity found to exist between the myelocytes and the mature polymorphonuclear leucocytes. This, together with the observed focal uniformity of maturation found in bone marrow, and the periodicity of the fluctuations of the neutrophils in the peripheral blood, leads to the formulation of the hypothesis of a constant functional withdrawal of granulocytes from the peripheral blood with a periodic delivery of new cells from the marrow, which in leucopenia and in leucocytosis represents a depression or a stimulation, respectively, of the normal mechanism. The nature and degree of the response are an approximate index of the cellular factor in the complex of the "resistance" of the particular individual.
