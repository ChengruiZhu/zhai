The researchers used data on blood samples from 1,518 patients collected along the Thai-Myanmar and Thai-Cambodian borders (where resistance first developed) from 2001 to 2012. All patients had been treated with ACT, and the time it took for the drugs to kill half of the parasites in their blood (the parasite half-life) had been measured. When the researchers used mathematical models to analyse these parasite half-life assessments after ACT treatment, they found that a model that assumed two different parasite subpopulations best explained the actual data. One of these subpopulations—and the only one present in the early years before resistance developed—had a shorter parasite half-life of about 3 hours (equivalent to sensitive parasites that still are killed efficiently by the ACT drugs). The second population began to appear around 2008 and had a longer half-life of about 6.5 hours, equivalent to parasites that had acquired resistance to artemisinin, and consistent with measurements of Kelch 13–mutant parasites. The parasite half-life predicted the likelihood of an artemisinin-resistant infection for individual patients, but this was influenced by how common resistance was in that area: the critical half-life varied between 3.5 hours (in areas where resistance is rare) and 5.5 hours (in areas where resistance is common). This means that there is not a universal cut-off value in parasite half-life to denote an infection as ‘sensitive’ or ‘resistant’ because intermediate half-lives can be part of the lower tail end of the resistant parasite half-life distribution or the top-end of the sensitive one. The model the researchers developed can estimate the background proportion of resistant infections, and this can then be used to calculate the probability for an individual infection to belong to a resistant or sensitive parasite half-life distribution, thereby providing a more accurate assessment of resistance. Taking this into account, the researchers found that the current WHO 'day-3' cut-off value of 10% predicts the potential presence of artemisinin-resistant infections in most but not all scenarios.
