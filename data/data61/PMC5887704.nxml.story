Cellular therapy is being actively pursued as a therapeutic modality in many of the neurological diseases. A variety of stem cells from diverse sources have been studied in detail and have been shown to exhibit angiogenetic and immunomodulatory properties in addition to other neuroprotective effects. Published clinical data have shown bone marrow mononuclear cell (BMMNC) injection in neurological disorders is safe and possesses regenerative potential. We illustrate a case of 27-year-old male with traumatic brachial plexus injury, administered with autologous BMMNCs intrathecally and intramuscularly, followed by multidisciplinary rehabilitation. At the follow-up assessment of 3 and 7 months after first cell transplantation, improvements were recorded in muscle strength and movements. Electromyography (EMG) performed after the intervention showed a response in biceps and deltoid muscles suggesting the process of reinnervation at the site of injury. In view of the improvements observed after the treatment, the patient underwent second cell transplantation 8 months after the first transplantation. Muscle wasting had completely stopped with an increase in the muscle girth. No adverse effects were noted. Improvements were maintained for 4 years. A comprehensive randomized study for this type of injury is needed to establish the therapeutic benefits of cellular therapy.
