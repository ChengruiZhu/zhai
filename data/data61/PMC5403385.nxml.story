 tunics (SCTs) on the healing of cutaneous wounds. We examined the physical properties and therapeutic effects of three CMs regenerated from SCTs (referred to as SCT- CMs), including normal CM (SCT-CM), freeze-dried SCT-CM (FSCT-CM) and sodium alginate-supplemented SCT-CM (ASCT-CM) on skin regeneration and angiogenesis using Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. FSCT-CM exhibited an outstanding interlayered structure, a high tensile strength (1.64 MPa), low elongation (28.59%) and a low water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) compared with the other SCT-CMs, although the fluid uptake rate was maintained at a medium level. In the SD rats with surgically wounded skin, the wound area and score of wound edge were lower in the FSCT-CM-treated group than in the gauze (GZ)-treated group on days 3–6 and 12–14. In addition, a significant attenuation in the histopathological changes was observed in the FSCT-CM-treated group. Furthermore, the expression level of collagen-1 and the signaling pathway of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 were significantly stimulated by the topical application of FSCT-CM. However, no signs of toxicity were detected in the livers or kidneys of the three SCT-CM-treated groups. Overall, our data indicate that the FSCT-CM may accelerate the process of wound healing in the surgically wounded skin of SD rats through the regulation of angiogenesis and connective tissue formation without inducing any specific toxicity.
