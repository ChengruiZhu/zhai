-methyltransferase (COMT) plays a central role in DNA repair and estrogen-induced carcinogenesis. Many recent epidemiologic studies have investigated the association between the COMT Val158Met polymorphism and cancer risk, but the results are inconclusive. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the association between cancer susceptibility and COMT Val158Met in different genetic models. Overall, no significant associations were found between COMT Val158Met polymorphism and cancer risk (homozygote model: odds ratio [OR] =1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.98, 1.13]; heterozygote model: OR =1.01, 95% CI = [0.98, 1.04]; dominant model: OR =1.02, 95% CI [0.97, 1.06], and recessive model: OR =1.03, 95% CI [0.97, 1.09]). In the subgroup analysis of cancer type, COMT Val158Met was significantly associated with increased risks of bladder cancer in recessive model, and esophageal cancer in homozygote model, heterozygote model, and dominant model. Subgroup analyses based on ethnicities, COMT Val158Met was significantly associated with increased risk of cancer in homozygote and recessive model among Asians. In addition, homozygote, recessive, and dominant models were significantly associated with increased cancer risk in the subgroup of allele-specific polymerase chain reaction genotyping. Significant associations were not observed when data were stratified by the source of the controls. In summary, this meta-analysis suggested that COMT Val158Met polymorphism might not be a risk factor for overall cancer risk, but it might be involved in cancer development at least in some ethnic groups (Asian) or some specific cancer types (bladder and esophageal cell cancer). Further evaluations of more preclinical and epidemiological studies are required.
