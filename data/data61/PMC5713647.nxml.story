The project began with an online survey, which was sent to Wisconsin trauma center medical directors and trauma coordinators for the purpose of gathering information on current substance use screening practices. Next, a focus group of trauma center staff was convened to discuss barriers and facilitators to screening, resources available and needed to support trauma patients with opioid use disorders, and measurable clinical observations that could indicate a patientâ€™s potential risk for opioid misuse. Data from the surveys and focus group were combined to inform the data collection instruments that are currently being administered to patients recruited from the University of Wisconsin Hospital Trauma Inpatient and Orthopedic Surgery Services. Eligible and consenting patients complete standardized measures of socio-demographics, substance use history, opioid misuse risk, mental health, medical history, and injury and pain severity. Follow up visits at weeks 4, 12, and 24 after hospital discharge assess hypothesized risk factors for opioid addiction and opioid use disorder diagnosis. At the completion of patient data collection, a forward stepwise regression will identify factors of most significant risk of the development of opioid use disorder after traumatic injury. This modeling will inform the development of a novel opioid risk screening tool, which will undergo pilot implementation at 4 Wisconsin ACS Level I and Level II trauma centers, using an evidence-based implementation strategy with roots in systems engineering.
