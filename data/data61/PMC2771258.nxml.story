The plasma or serum levels of various enzymes and components are known to increase in rats with water-immersion restraint stress (WIRS). We examined whether oxidative stress is involved in increases in the serum levels of various enzymes and components in rats with WIRS. Rats were exposed to WIRS for 6 h after oral administration of vitamin E (VE) (50 or 250 mg/kg). Rats with WIRS had increased serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotranseferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, corticosterone, adrenocorticotropic hormone and lipid peroxide (LPO) levels, increased kidney and heart VE levels, decreased skeletal muscle VE level, and increased LPO levels in all tissues studied. Pre-administered VE (50 or 250 mg/kg) attenuated the increased serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotranseferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, urea nitrogen, creatinine, and LPO levels, the decreased skeletal muscle VE level, and the increased LPO levels in all tissues studied more effectively at its higher dose than at its lower dose. However, either dose of the pre-administered VE did not affect the increased serum glucose, corticosterone, and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels. These results suggest that oxidative stress is involved in increases in the serum levels of various enzymes and components in rats with WIRS.
