HLDA10 is the Tenth Human Leukocyte Differentiation Antigen (HLDA) Workshop. The HLDA Workshops provide a mechanism to allocate cluster of differentiation (CD) nomenclature by engaging in interlaboratory studies. As the host laboratory, we invited researchers from national and international academic and commercial institutions to submit monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to human leukocyte surface membrane molecules, particularly those that recognised molecules on human myeloid cell populations and dendritic cells (DCs). These mAbs were tested for activity and then distributed as a blinded panel to 15 international laboratories to test on different leukocyte populations. These populations included blood DCs, skin-derived DCs, tonsil leukocytes, monocyte-derived DCs, CD34-derived DCs, macrophage populations and diagnostic acute myeloid leukaemia and lymphoma samples. Each laboratory was provided with enough mAb to perform five repeat experiments. Here, we summarise the reactivity of different mAb to 68 different cell-surface molecules expressed by human myeloid and DC populations. Submitted mAbs to some of the molecules were further validated to collate data required to designate a formal CD number. This collaborative process provides the broader scientific community with an invaluable data set validating mAbs to leukocyte-surface molecules.
