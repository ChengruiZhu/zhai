The large epidemiological studies demonstrated that atrial fibrillation is correlated with high mortality and adverse events in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The aim of this study was to determinate predictors of atrial fibrillation develop during the hospital period in patients with acute myocardial infarction as well as short- and long-term mortality depending on the atrial fibrillation presentation. The 600 patients with an acute myocardial infarction were included in the study and follow-up 84 months. Atrial fibrillation develops during the hospital period was registered in 48 patients (8%). After adjustment by logistic regression model the strongest predictor of atrial fibrillation develop during the hospital period was older age, particularly more than 70 years (odds ratio 2.37, CI 1.23-4.58, p=0.010), followed by increased of Body Mass Index (odds ratio 1.17, CI 1.04-1.33, p=0.012), enlarged diameter of left atrium (LA) (odds ratio 1,18, CI 1,03-1,33, p=0,015) presentation of mitral regurgitation (odds ratio 3.56, CI 1.25-10.32, p=0.018) and B-type natriuretic peptide (odds ratio 2.12, CI 1.24-3.33, p=0.048).Patients with atrial fibrillation develop during the hospital period had a higher mortality during the hospital course (10.4% vs. 5.6%) p=0.179. as well as follow-up period of 84 months than patients without it (64.6% vs. 39.1%) p=0.569, than patients without it, but without statistically significance. Patients with AF develop during the hospital period had higher mortality during the hospital course as well as follow up period of 84 months than patients without it, but without statistically significance.
