Computational strain design procedures aim at assisting metabolic engineering efforts by identifying metabolic interventions leading to the targeted overproduction of a desired chemical using network models of cellular metabolism. The effect of metabolite concentrations and substrate-level enzyme regulation cannot be captured with stoichiometry-only metabolic models and analysis methods. Here, we introduce k-OptForce, an optimization-based strain design framework incorporating the mechanistic details afforded by kinetic models, whenever available, into a genome-scale stoichiometric-based modeling formalism. The resulting optimization problems pose significant computational challenges due to the bilevel nature of the formulation and the nonconvex terms in the constraints. A tractable reformulation and solution procedure is introduced for solving the optimization problems. k-OptForce uses kinetic information to (re)apportion reaction fluxes in the network by identifying interventions comprised of both direct enzymatic parameter changes (for reactions with available kinetics) and reaction flux changes (for reactions with only stoichiometric information). Our results show that the introduction of kinetic expressions can significantly alter the identified interventions compared to those identified with stoichiometry-alone analysis. In particular, additional modifications are required in some cases to avoid the violation of metabolite concentration bounds, while in other cases, the kinetic constraints yield metabolic flux distributions that favor the overproduction of the desired product thereby requiring fewer direct interventions.
