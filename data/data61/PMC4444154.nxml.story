Human herpesvirus 6B (HHV6B) infects over 90% of the population, and normally establishes a latent infection, where episodes of reactivation are asymptomatic. However, in immunocompromised patients HHV6B reactivation is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Cellular immunotherapy has been utilised against other herpesvirus in immunocompromised settings. However, limited information on the immune response against HHV6B has hampered the development of immunotherapy for HHV6B-driven disease. In this study, we have analysed the cellular immune response against four HHV6B antigens in a panel of 30 healthy donors. We show that the base-line level of T cell reactivity in peripheral blood is very low to undetectable. A short-term reactivation step enabled expansion of T cell responses, and all donors responded to at least 1 antigen, but more commonly 3 or 4. A hierarchy of immunogenicity was determined with antigens U90 and U54 being co-dominant, followed by U11 and U39. Putative CD8+ T cell epitopes were mapped to U90 and U11, predicted to be presented in the context of HLA-A1, A29, B39 and C6. T cells reactive against these novel epitopes were able to recognise virus-infected cells. Our data is supportive of the application and on-going development of T cell immunotherapy against HHVB-driven disease in the immunocompromised host.
