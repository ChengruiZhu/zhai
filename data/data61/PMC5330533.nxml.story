Unraveling the lower-level (microscopic) processes underlying the overall (macroscopic) cell response to a given stimulus is a challenging problem in cell physiology. This has been a classic problem in biophysics, where the ability to record the activity of single ion channels that generate a macroscopic ion current has allowed a measure of direct access to the underlying microscopic processes. These classic studies have demonstrated that very different groupings of the microscopic processes can yield extremely similar macroscopic responses. Biologists in fields other than biophysics are frequently confronted with the same macroscopic-to-microscopic problem, usually, however, without any direct access to the microscopic processes. Thus, the development of computational methods to deduce from the available macroscopic measurements the nature of the underlying microscopic processes can be expected to substantially advance the study of many areas of cell physiology. Toward that aim, here we have derived and tested a hybrid computational-analytical method to extract information about the microscopic processes that is hidden in macroscopic experimental traces. Our method is independent of the particular system under study, and thus can be applied to new as well as previously-recorded macroscopic traces obtained in a wide variety of biological systems.
