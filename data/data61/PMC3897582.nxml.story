Novel pregna-5, 7-dienes were synthesized and subjected to UVB irradiation to generate the corresponding pre-D intermediates, tachysterol and lumisterol analogs. The kinetics of the conversion from each of the pre-D intermediates to the corresponding novel D analogs was investigated by using real time 1H NMR measurements inside the NMR magnet. Both the length and composition of the side chains were found to affect the rate of the kinetic conversion from pre-D intermediates to the thermodynamically more stable D analogs. Compound 7cc which has both a long side chain and a tertiary alcohol moiety showed the highest conversion rate, while compound 4a-S which has a very short side chain without the tertiary alcohol had the lowest conversion rate among the 13 tested compounds. We also determined product distributions for these 5,7-dienes upon UVB irradiation followed by thermodynamic equilibration. No clear correlations between product distribution and side chain length or composition were identifiable under the current experimental conditions, suggesting there are other factors affecting the kinetics during the photochemical reactions for these 5,7-dienes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the influences of side chain length and composition on the real time conversion kinetics from pre-D to D are studied. This study could serve as step-stones in future kinetic studies of novel biologically active 5,7-dienes and their corresponding D analogs under more physiologically relevant ex vivo or in vivo conditions, as well as providing important insights into optimizing yields of the desired active products during their organic syntheses.
