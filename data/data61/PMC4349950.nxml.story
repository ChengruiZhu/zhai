Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, and irreversible fibrotic lung disease that requires long-term treatment. Given the importance of adherence to treatment and management of adverse events (AEs), patients with IPF need long-term, high-quality support in living with their condition, and adhering to therapy so they can derive maximum benefit. The IPF Care Patient Support Program (IPF Care) provides support, education, and empowerment to patients receiving pirfenidone for the treatment of IPF in Europe, through the provision of frequent, patient-managed discussions with specialist IPF nurses. In this review, we describe the structure of IPF Care in the United Kingdom (UK) and Austria, two of the longest-running IPF Care programs to date, and describe the benefits that these programs provide to patients with IPF. Analysis of results demonstrates a low rate of discontinuation from the program, and provides insight into the questions and concerns that patients express, not only with respect to pirfenidone (the only approved treatment for IPF at the time of analysis), but also in relation to other aspects of living with IPF. Pirfenidone dose modifications are common in patients in IPF Care and AEs most commonly occur early in treatment, with the majority of affected patients continuing on a stable maintenance dose. This highlights the value of the advice and support that patients receive in IPF Care regarding management of AEs and staying on treatment. Patient satisfaction was high in a survey of the UK program, with patients reporting high scores regarding ‘feeling in control of their condition’, ‘knowing what to expect from treatment’, and ‘feeling confident about how their disease is managed’. IPF Care in Europe will continue to evolve over time, striving to provide individually tailored support and patient-friendly information to improve treatment outcomes and quality of life for patients living with IPF.
