., unattached or only loosely attached to protein). On the other hand, in every case in which the serum lipids were elevated, the greater proportion of the lipid phosphorus and cholesterol was "readily extractable," irrespective of whether atherosclerosis developed or was inhibited. Analysis of the lipid content of the aorta of rabbits not fed cholesterol, whether diabetic or non-diabetic, and from alloxan-diabetic rabbits fed cholesterol but protected from the development of atherosclerosis, showed that there was no significant difference in lipid content or composition among the animals of these groups. When atherosclerosis developed following cholesterol feeding, the lipid composition of the aortas was essentially the same in both control and diabetic animals. The deposited lipid consisted predominantly of cholesterol with small and fairly constant proportions of other lipids that did not vary significantly regardless of the quantities of these other lipids present in the circulating blood. In the less severe lesions the proportion of ester cholesterol was greater than that of free cholesterol, but in advanced lesions the reverse was true. The following conclusions are drawn concerning the pathogenesis of experimental cholesterol atherosclerosis in the rabbit: 1. Instability of cholesterol in the blood rather than hypercholesterolemia,
