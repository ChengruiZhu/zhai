B7 homolog 4 (B7-H4) has been recently reported to be a prognostic marker in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in some studies. However, the results remained conflicting. Thus, we aimed to comprehensively assess the association between B7-H4 expression and prognosis of NSCLC patients by performing a meta-analysis. Relevant publications were thoroughly searched of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). The pooled odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were applied to evaluate the effects. A total of 9 studies comprising 1444 patients were included in this meta-analysis. B7-H4 overexpression was associated with presence of lymph node metastasis (OR=3.59, 95%CI=2.39-5.38, p<0.001; fixed effect), advanced TNM stage (OR=2.36, 95%CI=1.2-4.67, p=0.013; random effect), and poor differentiation (OR=2.11, 95%CI=1.12-3.99, p=0.021; fixed effect). However, B7-H4 had no significant correlation with gender, age or histology in NSCLC. Furthermore, in a fixed effects model, the results indicated that B7-H4 overexpression was significantly associated with poor OS (HR=2.03, 95%CI=1.41-2.92, p<0.001). This meta-analysis demonstrated that high B7-H4 expression is an unfavorable prognostic factor in NSCLC. Because few studies were included for meta-analysis and almost all included studies were performed on Chinese patients, therefore; large scale prospective studies are needed to verify our results.
