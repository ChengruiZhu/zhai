)-L-Leu was immunoprecipitated and isolated with SDS-PAGE. Two tryptic peptides, one in the kinase loop and a control peptide just outside of the loop were sequenced via nano-LC interfaced with quadruple time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (Q-TOF tandem MS). Their relative isotopologue abundances were determined by stable isotope labeling by amino acids in mammalians (SILAM). Relative quantifications based on paired heavy/light peptides were obtained in 3 steps. The first step included homogenization of mixtures of equal amounts of tissue from burned and sham-treated animals (i.e., isotope dilution) and acquisition of uncorrected data based on parent monoisotopic MS ion ratios. The second step included determination of isotopic enrichment of the kinase from burned mice on Day 7 and the third step enrichment correction of partially labeled heavy and light monoisotopic MS ion ratios for relative quantification of bioactivity (loop peptide) and expression level (control peptide). Protein synthesis and enrichment after injury were found to be dependent on tissue and turnover of individual proteins. Three heavy and light monoisotopic ion ratios for albumin peptides from burned mice indicated ~55% enrichment and ~16.7-fold downregulation. In contract, serum amyloid P had ~66% enrichment and was significantly upregulated. Akt1/PKBÎ± had ~56% enrichment and kinase level in response to the burn injury was upregulated compared with the control peptide. However, kinase bioactivity, represented by the Cys
