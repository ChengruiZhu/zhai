Japanese cedar pollinosis is the predominant seasonal allergic rhinitis in Japan, and it has increased in prevalence during the past 10 years. Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) is considered a safe and effective treatment for pollinosis. Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short single-stranded RNA molecules that posttranscriptionally silence gene expression and may mediate allergic immune responses. The aim of this study was to investigate the miRNA alteration in asymptomatic subjects sensitized to Japanese cedar pollen under prophylactic SLIT under part of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-center trial. Analysis was undertaken in 15 asymptomatic subjects sensitized to Japanese cedar pollen–specific IgE (ImmunoCAP class ≥2) who participated in 2013. The SLIT group (n = 6) received standardized Japanese cedar pollen extract and the placebo group (n = 9) received an inactive placebo for 5 months covering the cedar pollen season. Changes in serum miRNAs were measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction to determine whether SLIT had effects on profiles of circulating miRNA. Seven subjects in the placebo group developed pollinosis symptoms, whereas no subjects in the SLIT group did (p = 0.007). Serum hsa-miR-223 was significantly up-regulated in postseason compared with preseason samples. The hsa-let-7b was significantly more down-regulated in postseason than in preseason samples from the placebo group; however, no significant differences were observed in those from the SLIT group. A significant decrease in circulating let-7b was also observed in the subjects who developed symptoms. Prophylactic SLIT was effective in preventing the development of pollinosis. Alterations in miRNA expression occurred in asymptomatic, sensitized subjects during cedar pollen season.
