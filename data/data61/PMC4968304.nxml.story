There were 50 patients (16 females, 34 males) with a mean age of 37.8 years (range, 16.6-65.7) and a mean BMI of 27.3 (range, 20.5-49.2) included in this study. Fifteen patients underwent lateral meniscus root repair and 35 patients underwent medial meniscus root repair. Three patients who underwent lateral meniscus root repair required revision meniscus root repair surgery, while no patients who underwent medial meniscus root repair required revision surgery (p=0.26). There was a significant difference in preoperative and postoperative Lysholm score (53 vs. 78) (p<0.001), Tegner activity scale (2.0 vs. 4.0) (p=0.03), SF-12 physical component subscale (38 vs. 50) (p=0.001) and WOMAC (36 vs. 8) (p<0.001) for the total population. Median patient satisfaction with outcome was 9 (range, 1-10). There was no significant difference in mean age between lateral and medial root repair groups (32 vs. 40) (p=0.12) or gender (p=0.19). There was no significant difference in gender between lateral and medial root repair groups (p=0.95). There was a significant difference in concurrent ACL reconstructions between lateral versus medial root repair groups (67% vs. 17%) (p<0.001). There was no significant difference in average postoperative Lysholm score (75 vs. 80) (p=0.31), IKDC (72 vs. 71) (p=0.23), SF-12 physical component subscale (48.4 vs. 51.0) (p=0.85) or WOMAC score (2.7 vs. 1.7) (p=0.80) for lateral versus medial meniscus root repairs. There was no significant difference in median postoperative Tegner activity scale for lateral versus medial meniscus root repairs (4 vs. 4) (p=0.88) or in median patient satisfaction with outcome for lateral versus medial meniscus root repairs (9 vs. 9) (p=0.61).
