Understanding how the three-dimensional (3D) molecular structure of proteins influences their function can provide insights into the workings of biological systems. Structural Genomics Initiatives have been set up to investigate these structures on a large scale and make the data available to the wider biological research community. However, in a significant number of cases, there is little known about the functions of the structures that are solved. To address this, computational methods can be used as a predictive tool to guide future experimental investigations. One such approach is to exploit global structural comparison to assign the protein in question to an evolutionary family, which has already been functionally characterised. However, this is problematic in some large evolutionary families, which contain a number of different functional sub-families. We have developed a new method (FLORA) which is able to calculate 3D “motifs” which are specific to each of these sub-families. Any new protein structure can then be compared against these motifs to make a more accurate prediction of its function. Our paper shows that FLORA substantially outperforms other standard approaches for predicting function from structure. We use our method to make confident functional predictions for a set of proteins solved by the structural genomics projects, which could not have been assigned reliably by global structure comparison.
