In eukaryotic cells, protein-coding genes are transcribed to produce pre-messenger RNAs (pre–mRNAs) that are processed at the 3′ end by the addition of a sequence of poly-adenosine. This 3′ end poly(A) tail normally confers positive roles to the mRNA life cycle by stimulating nuclear export and translation. The fundamental role of mRNA polyadenylation is generally mediated by the activity of poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) that bind to the 3′ poly(A) tail of eukaryotic mRNAs. In the nucleus, the evolutionarily conserved poly(A)-binding protein PABPN1 is thought to be important for gene expression, as it stimulates mRNA polyadenylation in biochemical assays. Using a high-throughput sequencing approach that quantitatively measures the level of RNA expressed from all genes, we addressed the global impact of a PABPN1 deficiency on human gene expression. Notably, we found that most mRNAs were normally expressed in PABPN1–deficient cells, a result inconsistent with a role for PABPN1 in general mRNA metabolism. Surprisingly, our genome-wide analysis unveiled a new function for PABPN1 in a polyadenylation-dependent pathway of RNA decay that targets non-protein coding genes. Our discovery that PABPN1 functions in the regulation of noncoding RNAs raises the possibility that oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, a disease associated with mutations in the
