Despite the high efficacy and safety of arsenic trioxide (ATO) in treating acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and eradicating APL leukemia-initiating cells (LICs), the mechanism underlying its selective cytotoxicity remains elusive. We have recently demonstrated that APL cells undergo a novel cell death program, termed ETosis, through autophagy. However, the role of ETosis in ATO-induced APL LIC eradication remains unclear. For this study, we evaluated the effects of ATO on ETosis and the contributions of drug-induced ETosis to APL LIC eradication. In NB4 cells, ATO primarily increased ETosis at moderate concentrations (0.5–0.75 μM) and stimulated apoptosis at higher doses (1.0–2.0 μM). Furthermore, ATO induced ETosis through mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent autophagy, which was partially regulated by reactive oxygen species. Additionally, rapamycin-enhanced ATO-induced ETosis in NB4 cells and APL cells from newly diagnosed and relapsed patients. In contrast, rapamycin had no effect on apoptosis in these cells. We also noted that PML/RARA oncoprotein was effectively cleared with this combination. Intriguingly, activation of autophagy with rapamycin-enhanced APL LIC eradication clearance by ATO in vitro and in a xenograft APL model, while inhibition of autophagy spared clonogenic cells. Our current results show that ATO exerts antileukemic effects at least partially through ETosis and targets LICs primarily through ETosis. Addition of drugs that target the ETotic pathway could be a promising therapeutic strategy to further eradicate LICs and reduce relapse.
