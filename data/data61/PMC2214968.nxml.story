The actions of grayanotoxin I, veratrine, and tetrodotoxin on the membrane potential of the Schwann cell were studied in the giant nerve fiber of the squid Sepioteuthis sepioidea. Schwann cells of intact nerve fibers and Schwann cells attached to axons cut lengthwise over several millimeters were utilized. The axon membrane potential in the intact nerve fibers was also monitored. The effects of grayanotoxin I and veratrine on the membrane potential of the Schwann cell were found to be similar to those they produce on the resting membrane potential of the giant axon. Thus, grayanotoxin I (1-30 muM) and veratrine (5-50 mug-jl-1), externally applied to the intact nerve fiber or to axon-free nerve fiber sheaths, produce a Schwann cell depolarization which can be reversed by decreasing the external sodium concentration or by external application of tetrodotoxin. The magnitude of these membrane potential changes is related to the concentrations of the drugs in the external medium. These results indicate the existence of sodium pathways in the electrically unexcitable Schwann cell membrane of S. sepioidea, which can be opened up by grayanotoxin I and veratrine, and afterwards are blocked by tetrodotoxin. The sodium pathways of the Schwann cell membrane appear to be different from those of the axolemma which show a voltage-dependent conductance.
