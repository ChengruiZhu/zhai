Bone tissue engineering is one of the main branches of regenerative medicine. In this field, the use of a scaffold, which supported bone development, in combination with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), has promised better outcomes for bone regeneration. In particular, human gingival mesenchymal stem cells (hGMSCs) may present advantages compared to other MSCs, including the easier isolation. However, MSCsâ€™ secretome has attracted much attention for its potential use in tissue regeneration, such as conditioned medium (CM) that contains different soluble factors proved to be useful for the regenerative purposes. In this study, we evaluated the osteogenic capacity of a poly-(lactide) (3D-PLA) scaffold enriched with hGMSCs and hGMSCs derived CM and its ability to regenerate bone defects in rat calvarias. 3D-PLA alone, 3D-PLA + CM or 3D-PLA + hGMSCs with/without CM were implanted in Wistar male rats subjected to calvarial defects. We observed that 3D-PLA scaffold enriched with hGMSCs and CM showed a better osteogenic capacity, being able to repair the calvarial defect as revealed in vivo by morphological evaluation. Moreover, transcriptomic analysis in vitro revealed the upregulation of genes involved in ossification and regulation of ossification in the 3D-PLA + CM + hGMSCs group. All of these results indicate the great osteogenic ability of 3D-PLA + CM + hGMSCs supporting its use in bone regenerative medicine, in particular in the repair of cranial bone defects. Especially, hGMSCs derived CM played a key role in the induction of the osteogenic process and in bone regeneration.
