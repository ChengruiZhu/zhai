Membrane structures are critical to skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling, and disruptions in key membrane proteins can lead to muscular dystrophy. Caveolae, micro-domains in the cell membrane, are known to be important in forming muscle-specific membrane structures such as the T-tubule network and play a role in some forms of muscular dystrophy. Two classes of proteins help form caveolae: Caveolins and Cavins. However, it is poorly understood how Cavins function in skeletal muscle development or whether Cavin dysfunction can lead to muscular dystrophy. To address these questions, we generated a Cavin4b/Murcb deficient zebrafish line by targeted TALEN mutagenesis and found that Cavin4b/Murcb is necessary for the formation and function of skeletal muscle. Cavin4b/Murcb mutant zebrafish exhibit progressive skeletal muscle deterioration, disrupted membrane structures early in development and aberrant growth factor signaling. Cavin4b/Murcb deficient fish have smaller and irregularly shaped muscle fibers with fibrosis, similar to what is observed in muscular dystrophy. Cavin4b/Murcb mutant fish also exhibit mislocalized Caveolin-1 and Caveolin-3 as well as disrupted T-tubules, suggesting that Cavin4b/Murcb regulates the distribution of caveolar proteins and that this misregulation impacts the development of the T-tubule network.
