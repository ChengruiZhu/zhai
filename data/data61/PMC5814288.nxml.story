Adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC) of the lung is an unusual histology type in non-small-cell lung cancers. Due to its rarity, the clinicopathological characteristics and survival outcomes of the lung ASC are incompletely understood. We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to enroll 203,208 eligible patients, including 4,245 ASC, 124,253 adenocarcinoma (ADC) and 74,710 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients. To date, this is the largest cohort in a study for ASC of the lung. With regard to age, sex, race, year of diagnosis, tumor size and SEER stage, ASC was intermediate between ADC and SCC. However, compared with ADC and SCC patients, ASC patients presented with a higher tumor grade and lower prevalence of nodal metastasis. More ASC patients underwent surgery and a lower proportion underwent radiation treatment and chemotherapy. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that ASC patients had a better prognosis than ADC and SCC patients, but stratified analysis showed that the prognosis of ASC patients was worse than that of ADC and SCC patients in surgery and non-surgery subgroup. Multivariate analysis further confirmed that the ASC histology type was a risk factor for poor prognosis with respect to ADC and SCC. Using the propensity score matching to 1:1 match ASC with ADC or SCC, we found that ASC patients had worse survival than ADC and SCC patients. Subgroup analysis further demonstrated that ASC was a more aggressive histology type with a worse prognosis. These results provided a deep understanding of ASC, which contributed to better clinical diagnosis and treatment.
