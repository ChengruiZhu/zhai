Sarcoidosis, a chronic, inflammatory disease that affects various different organs, is characterized by noncaseating epitheloid granulomas. This systemic inflammatory process is associated with an increased risk of cancer. Several cases of sarcoidosis that mimic metastatic tumor progression in radiological findings have been reported so far. However, there are also cases that have presented a coexistence of sarcoidosis and metastasis, which have caused a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. Due to inadequate current therapies, a reliable differentiation between benign and malignant lesions is crucial. This review focuses on the residual risk of the coexistence of metastases within radiological suspicious lesions in patients with a history of solid tumors and sarcoidosis, as well as immunological findings, in order to explain the potential associations. Sarcoidosis has the potential to promote metastasis as it includes tumor-promoting and immune-regulating cell subsets. Notably, myeloid derived suppressor cells may serve a pivotal role in metastatic progression in patients with sarcoidosis. In addition, the present review also evaluates the potential novel diagnostic approaches, which may be able to differentiate between metastatic lesions and sarcoidosis. The risk of coexistent metastasis in sarcoidosis lesions must be considered by clinical practitioners, and a multidisciplinary approach may be required to avoid misdiagnosis and the subsequent unnecessary surgery or insufficient treatments.
