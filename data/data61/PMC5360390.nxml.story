Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that can give rise to different cell types of the mesodermal lineages. They are powerful sources for cell therapy in regenerative medicine as they can be isolated from various tissues, and can be expanded and induced to differentiate into multiple lineages. Recently, the umbilical cord has been suggested as an alternative source of MSCs. Although MSCs derived from the umbilical cord can be induced to differentiate into osteoblasts with a phenotypic similarity to that of bone marrow-derived MSCs, the differentiation ability is not consistent. In addition, MSCs from the umbilical cord require a longer period of time to differentiate into osteoblasts. Previous studies have demonstrated the benefits of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) in bone tissue regeneration. In addition, several studies have supported the use of BMP-2 in periodontal regeneration, sinus lift bone-grafting and non-unions in oral surgery. Although the use of BMP-2 for bone tissue regeneration has been extensively investigated, the BMP-2-induced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs derived from the umbilical cord has not yet been fully examined. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to examine the effects of BMP-2 on the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs derived from umbilical cord compared to that of MSCs derived from bone marrow. The degree of osteogenic differentiation following BMP-2 treatment was determined by assessing alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and the expression profiles of osteogenic differentiation marker genes, osterix (
