Proteins subject to proteolysis or phosphorylation during apoptosis are commonly precipitated by autoantibodies found in the serum of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We screened a panel of murine monoclonal and human monospecific sera reactive with known autoantigens for their ability to selectively precipitate phosphoproteins from apoptotic Jurkat T cell lysates. Sera known to recognize the U1–small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex (confirmed by their ability to precipitate U1–snRNA) selectively precipitated a phosphoprotein complex (pp54, pp42, pp34, and pp23) from apoptotic lysates. Monoclonal antibodies reactive with U1–snRNP proteins precipitated the same phosphoprotein complex from apoptotic lysates. The phosphorylation and/or recruitment of these proteins to the U1–snRNP complex is induced by multiple apoptotic stimuli (e.g., Fas ligation, gamma irradiation, or UV irradiation), and is blocked by overexpression of bcl-2. The U1–snRNP-associated phosphoprotein complex is immunoprecipitated by monoclonal antibodies reactive with serine/arginine (SR) proteins that comprise a structurally related family of splicing factors. The association of phosphorylated SR proteins with the U1–snRNP complex in cells undergoing apoptosis suggests a mechanism for regulation of alternative splicing of apoptotic effector molecules.
