Klinefelter syndrome is the most frequent chromosomal aneuploidy in males occurring in about 1 in 660 males. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated increased risk of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes in adults with Klinefelter syndrome. There is only one previous report of neonatal diabetes in a patient with Klinefelter syndrome. We report transient neonatal diabetes due to a pathogenic heterozygous variant in KCNJ11 in a male infant with Klinefelter syndrome. A 78-day old male infant was noted to have sustained hyperglycemia with serum glucose ranging between 148 mg/dL (8.2 mmol/L) and 381 mg/dL (21.2 mmol/L) three days after undergoing a complete repair of an atrioventricular defect. Hemoglobin A1c was 6.6%. The patient was born at term with a birth weight of 2.16 kg following a pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes that was controlled with diet. The patient was initially started on a continuous intravenous insulin drip and subsequently placed on subcutaneous insulin (glargine, human isophane and regular insulin). Insulin was gradually decreased and eventually discontinued at seven months of age. Chromosomal microarray at 11 weeks of age showed XXY and a panel-based, molecular test for neonatal diabetes revealed a pathogenic heterozygous variant c.685G>A (p.Glu229Lys) in KCNJ11. The patient is now 34 months old and continues to have normal fasting and post-prandial glucose and HbA1C levels. The patient will need prospective follow up for assessment of his glycemic status. To our knowledge this is the second reported case of neonatal diabetes in an infant with Klinefelter syndrome and the first due to a mutation in the KCNJ11 in a patient with Klinefelter syndrome.
