The anatomical input to a cortical area defines, to a large extent, the functions that the area can perform. For example, if an area has no visual inputs, it cannot carry out computations on visual information. Therefore, understanding the inputs to a patch of cortex can provide fundamental insight into the function of the area. Anatomical tract tracing studies in macaque monkeys have defined much of the connectivity between areas of the macaque brain. We compiled the information on the anatomical inputs to 25 cytoarchitectonically defined frontal cortical areas. In its raw form, this connectivity is immensely complex, and the dominant inputs to each area cannot be clearly seen. To reduce the complexity, we carried out hierarchical cluster analysis on the areas based upon their inputs. We found a statistically robust organization of the areas. Identified clusters corresponded to anatomically contiguous groups, including orbital, ventral-medial, dorsal-medial, ventral-lateral, and dorsal-lateral areas. Using these groups, we were able to clearly define the dominant inputs to each cluster. We found that ventral-lateral, ventral-medial, dorsal-medial, dorsal-lateral, and caudal-orbital groups were defined by exterosensory, limbic, motor, exterosensory, and chemosensory inputs, respectively. These inputs likely drive the physiological responses found in each area.
