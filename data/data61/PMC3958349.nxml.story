The powerful anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive action of glucocorticoids have made them one of the most prescribed drugs worldwide. Unfortunately, acute or chronic treatment may have severe side-effects. Glucocorticoids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a ligand-dependent transcription factor. GR regulates gene expression directly by binding to DNA or indirectly by modulating the activity of other transcription factors. It is currently accepted that the direct pathway is mostly responsible for glucocorticoids side-effects and that the oligomerization state of the GR (whether it is a dimer or a monomer) determines which pathway (direct or indirect) will prevail. Hence, scientists have tried to develop “dissociated ligands” able to specifically activate the GR indirect pathway. In the present work, we employed a novel microscopy method named the number and brightness assay, which measures GR oligomerization state inside the living cell. Our results suggest that—contrary to the established view—there is no clear correlation between the oligomerization state of GR and the mechanistic pathway the receptor will follow upon ligand binding. This discovery presents supporting evidence towards the increasing view of the inherent complexity of glucocorticoid action and might impact future approaches towards the design of safer synthetic glucocorticoids.
