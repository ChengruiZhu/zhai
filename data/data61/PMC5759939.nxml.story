Cancers involving the oral cavity, head, and neck regions are often treated with cisplatin. In cancer therapy, the main target is to eliminate unwanted cancerous cells. However, reports on the nonselective nature of this drug have raised few concerns. Incorrect nutritional habits and lifestyle practices have been directly linked to cancer incidence. Nutrients with antioxidant activity inhibit cancer cells development, destroying them through oxidative stress and apoptosis. α-tocopherol, the potent antioxidant form of vitamin E is a known scavenger of free radicals. In vitro study exhibited effective antitumor activity of α-tocopherol on ORL-48 at 2.5 ± 0.42 µg/mL. Cisplatin exhibited stronger activity at 1.0 ± 0.15 µg/mL, but unlike α-tocopherol it exhibited cytotoxicity on normal human epidermal keratinocytes at very low concentration (<0.1 µg/mL). Despite the lower potency of α-tocopherol, signs of apoptosis such as the shrinkage of cells and appearance of apoptotic bodies were observed much earlier than cisplatin in time lapse microscopy. No apoptotic vesicles were formed with cisplatin, instead an increased population of cells in the holoclone form which may suggest different induction mechanisms between both agents. High accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase were observed through TUNEL and annexin V-biotin assays, while the exhibition of ultrastructural changes of the cellular structures verified the apoptotic mode of cell death by both agents. Both cisplatin and α-tocopherol displayed cell cycle arrest at the Sub G0 phase. α-tocopherol thus, showed potential as an antitumour agent for the treatment of oral cancer and merits further research.
