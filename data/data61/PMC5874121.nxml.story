The purpose of this study was to evaluate the dosimetric impact of cylinder size in high‐dose‐rate (HDR) vaginal cuff brachytherapy (VCBT). Sample plans of HDR VCBT in a list of cylinders ranging from 2.5 to 4 cm in diameter at 0.5 cm increment were created and analyzed. The doses were prescribed either at the 0.5 cm depth with 5.5 Gy for 4 fractions or at the cylinder surface with 8.8 Gy for 4 fractions, in various treatment lengths. A 0.5 cm shell volume called PTV_Eval was contoured for each plan and served as the target volume for dosimetric evaluation. The cumulative and differential dose volume histograms (c‐DVH and d‐DVH), mean doses (D‐mean) and the doses covering 90% (D90), 10% (D10), and 5% (D5) of PTV_Eval were calculated. In the 0.5 cm depth regimen, the DVH curves were found to have shifted toward the lower dose zone when a larger cylinder was used, but in the surface regimen the DVH curves shifted toward the higher dose zone as the cylinder size increased. The D‐means of the both regimens were between 6.9 and 7.8 Gy and dependent on the cylinder size but independent of the treatment length. A 0.5 cm variation of diameter could result in a 4% change of D‐mean. Average D90s were 5.7 (ranging from 5.6 to 5.8 Gy) and 6.1 Gy (from 5.7 to 6.4 Gy), respectively, for the 0.5 cm and surface regimens. Average D10 and D5 were 9.2 and 11 Gy, respectively, for the 0.5 cm depth regimen, and 8.9 and 9.7 Gy, respectively, for the surface regimen. D‐mean, D90, D10, and D5 for other prescription doses could be calculated from the lookup tables of this study. Results indicated that the cylinder size has moderate dosimetric impact, and that both regimens are comparable in dosimetric quality.
