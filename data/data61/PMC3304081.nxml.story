Solitary neurofibromal colonic polyps are a rare entity, particularly outside the setting of neurofibromatosis type 1. The clinical significance of such lesions has not yet been established. Though typically benign tumors, neurofibromas have been reported to undergo malignant transformation, with an increased risk of malignancy when associated with neurofibromatosis. In this case report, we present the rare case of a man found to have an isolated colonic neurofibroma without any personal/family history or clinical features of neurofibromatosis. A 59-year-old man with a history of dyslipidemia and degenerative joint disease presented for a routine screening colonoscopy. The colonoscopy revealed no abnormalities except a 3 mm transverse colon polyp and another 4 mm polyp in the descending colon. Biopsy results showed the descending colonic polyp to be a tubular adenoma; however, multiple levels of the 3 mm transverse colon polyp revealed interlacing bundles of spindle cells extending into the lamina propria with comma-shaped nuclei consistent with findings seen in neurofibroma. Isolated colonic neurofibromas are rare and understudied. While they are usually benign, they may undergo malignant transformation, especially when associated with neurofibromatosis. Thus, patients presenting with isolated neurofibromas should be followed for development of neurofibromatosis and malignancies.
