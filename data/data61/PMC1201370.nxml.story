Proteins found in seminal fluid accompanying sperm show dramatic effects on reproduction, such as manipulating female behavior. Even in primates they participate in competition between sperm of different males, and serve to protect sperm from infection by pathogens. These types of roles require the proteins to constantly adapt to stay ahead of the competition. Such adaptive pressures on proteins leave characteristic signatures in the DNA sequences that encode them. The authors used these signatures to identify adaptive evolution in primate seminal proteins and found extensive signs of adaptation when comparing thousands of seminal genes between human and chimpanzee. They further characterized outstanding genes in several primate species, including a diversity of apes and monkeys. Several of these proteins have no known function, yet by visualizing the adaptation on their three-dimensional surfaces, the authors uncovered clues to what is driving their evolution. In addition, they found several cases in which certain species lost their functional copies of these genes. Interestingly, species that showed loss of function do not participate in sperm competition. Past studies found widespread adaptation in fruit fly seminal fluid, and this study reveals extensive adaptation in primate seminal proteins. Could this be a phenomenon common among animals?
