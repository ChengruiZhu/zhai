Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most frequent gynecological malignancy and a major cause of morbidity and mortality for women worldwide. Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligands programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed death ligand 2 (PD-L2) have been well studied in lung cancer, melanoma and renal-cell cancer. However, few studies have been performed in EC. The purpose of the present study was to assess the expression of PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 in 35 human normal endometrial tissue samples and 75 human EC tissue samples using immunohistochemical staining. It was found that 61.3% of ECs were positive for PD-1 staining, which was almost exclusively found in the tumor-infiltrating immune cells. By contrast, PD-1 was not expressed in the tumor cells or normal endometrial tissues. It was also found that 14.3% of normal endometria and 17.3% of EC tissues were positive for PD-L1 expression, while 20.0% of normal endometrium and 37.3% of EC tissues were positive for PD-L2 expression; however, there was no statistically significant difference between the normal endometrium and EC tissues. PD-1 expression in the tumor-infiltrating immune cells was more frequently found in the moderately and poorly-differentiated ECs and non-endometrioid (type II) ECs than in the well-differentiated ECs and endometrioid (type I) ECs. Similarly, PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression in the tumor-infiltrating immune cells was more frequently found in the moderately and poorly-differentiated ECs and type II ECs than in the type I ECs. The present findings indicate a possible better outcome for future treatment with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody-based therapies against these subgroups of endometrial cancers with frequent expression of the PD-1/PD-L1/PD-L2 axis.
