Glioma is one of the most common types of adult primary brain tumors, and the underlying molecular mechanisms still remain unclear. Nuclear factor-kappa B1 (NF-κB1) is involved in a variety of malignancies and is widely expressed in malignant tumors. However, the expression of NF-κB1 in different grades of glioma, the correlation between NF-κB1 and Bcl-2 expressions in gliomas, and the research between NF-κB1 and early apoptosis of glioma cells have not been reported so far. In this study, the expression level of NF-κB1 in 31 human glioma tissues and six nonneoplastic brain tissues was determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results showed that the expression of NF-κB1 in human glioma tissues and glioma cell lines, SHG44 and U87, was significantly higher compared to noncancerous brain tissues and that the expression increased with increasing degrees of tumor malignancy. Similar results were demonstrated with the expression of Bcl-2 in the same human glioma specimens. Flow cytometry results showed that inhibition of NF-κB1 expression significantly promoted apoptosis of SHG44 and U87 in human glioma cells. Western blot analysis further confirmed decreased expression of Bcl-2 protein after inhibition of NF-κB1 protein expression. Taken together, NF-κB1 overexpression inhibits early apoptosis of glioma cells and high expression of NF-κB1 promotes the expression of antiapoptotic gene
