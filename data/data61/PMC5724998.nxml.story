 cells) were intravenously administered to groups 5 and 6. Ex4 (10 μg/kg) was intraperitoneally administered groups 4 and 6 at 30 min and days 1 to 5 after SS induction. Animals were euthanized at day 47 after CKD induction. Kidney-injury score, collagen-deposition area, and creatinine/BUN levels were lowest in group 1, highest in group 3 and significantly higher in group 2 than in groups 4 to 6 in a progressively increasing manner (all P<0.0001). Protein expressions of inflammatory (MMP-9/TNF-α/NF-κB/IL-1ß/ICAM-1), oxidative-stress (NOX-1/NOX-2/oxidized protein), apoptotic (mitochondrial-Bax/cleaved-caspase-3/cleaved-PARP) and fibrotic/DNA-damaged (Smad3/TGF-ß/γ-H2AX) biomarkers showed an identical pattern, whereas anti-fibrotic (BMP-2/Smad1/5), anti-apoptotic/endothelial-integrity (Bcl-2/eNOS) and podocyte-integrity (ZO-1/p-cadherin) biomarkers exhibited an opposite pattern of kidney-injury score among the six groups (all P>0.0001). Cellular expressions of inflammatory (CD14/CD68) and glomerulus/tubular-injury (WT-1/KIM-1) biomarkers displayed an identical pattern, whereas glomerulus/podocyte-component (dystroglycan/nephrin/ZO-1/fibronectin/p-cadherin) biomarkers showed an opposite kidney-injury score among the six groups (all P<0.0001). In conclusion, Ex4-ADMSC therapy effectively preserved renal function in the CKD-SS setting.
