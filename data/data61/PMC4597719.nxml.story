Fortyfour patients who underwent arthroscopically assisted achilles tendon repair during 1997-2011 in Osmangazi University Orthopaedics and Traumatology Department were retrospectively observed. The mean follow-up time was 69,7 months. One of patients had bilateral rupture. The diagnosis was based on loss of plantar flexion strength, palpation of the gap in the tendon, and a positive Thompson test. MRI and USG were used when needed. The ruptures were left-sided in nineteen patients and right-sided in twentysix. The cause of the rupture was recreational sports activity in thirtyeight, fall from height in four, missing a step in a staircase in two. Return the regular activity, ankle range of motion as compared with the opposite side, calf circumference, and ability to walk and stand tiptoe were recorded. All patients were operated on within 2-32 days after the rupture. Thirtysix operations were performed under spinal anesthesia and eight operations were performed under general anesthesia. Tourniquet was always used. Before starting the procedure, the rupture site and location of the gap are marked. Using the common videoarthroscopic instruments, a 70 degrees scope was inserted into the AT through the stab incision made previously, and the torn ends of the tendon were visualized with plantar flexion an extension of the ankle. After the visualization of the torn ends of the tendon and repair by the technique of Ma and Griffith care was focused to contact the ends of the tendon anatomically; then the sutures were knotted. A short leg circular cast with the ankle in slight plantar flexion was applied. American Orthopaedics Foot-Ankle Society (AOFAS) score was used to evaluate the long-term results..
