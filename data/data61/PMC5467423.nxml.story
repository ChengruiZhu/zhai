In order to access and resect the acetabular rim, arthroscopic acetabuloplasty was described with labral detachment. When the chondrolabral junction remains intact, acetabuloplasty and labral refixation can be performed maintaining an unharmed labrum. We aimed to evaluate the outcome of a group of patients treated with arthroscopic acetabuloplasty without labral detachment. During the study period, we retrospectively analysed 44 patients with pincer-type o combined impingement and an intact chondroblabral junction, with an average follow-up of 32 months (range: 27–38). We excluded patients with isolated CAM-type impingement and previous hip pathology. Radiographs were analysed to define impingement and classify grade of osteoarthritis. Clinical evaluation consisted of pre-operative and post-operative modified Harris hip score (mHHS) and WOMAC as well as post-operative visual analogue scale (VAS) of pain and satisfaction. Reoperations were considered surgical failures for purposes of survival analysis. Mean mHHS changed from 51.06 (SD 4.81) pre-operatively to 84.97 (SD 12.79) post-operatively. Pre-operative WOMAC was 29.18 (SD 8) and post-operative, 13.10 (SD 11). Post-operative VAS was 7.5 and 2.27 for satisfaction and pain, respectively. When comparing patients with Tönnis 0 to those with Tönnis 1, the former showed better results regarding post-operative mHHS (89.9 s versus 77.85,
