Central pattern-generating networks (CPGs) must be remarkably robust, maintaining functional rhythmic activity despite fluctuations in internal and external conditions. Recent experimental evidence suggests that this robustness is achieved by the coordinated regulation of many membrane and synaptic current parameters. Experimental and computational studies showed that linearly correlated sets of such parameters allow CPG neurons to produce and maintain their rhythmic activity. However, the mechanisms that allow multiple parameters to interact, thereby producing and maintaining rhythmic single cell and network activity, are not clear. Here, we use a half-center oscillator (HCO) model that replicates the electrical activity (rhythmic alternating bursting of mutually inhibitory interneurons) of the leech heartbeat CPG to investigate potential relationships between parameters that maintain functional bursting activity in the HCOs and the isolated component neurons (bursters). We found a linearly correlated set of three maximal conductances that maintains functional bursting activity similar to the animal in burster model instances, therefore increasing robustness of bursting activity. In addition, we found that bursting activity was very sensitive to individual variation of these parameters; only correlated changes could maintain the activity type.
