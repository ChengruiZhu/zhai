Mitotic catastrophe is an oncosuppressive mechanism that senses mitotic failure leading to cell death or senescence. As such, it protects against aneuploidy and genetic instability, and its induction in cancer cells by exogenous agents is currently seen as a promising therapeutic end point. Apoptin, a small protein from Chicken Anemia Virus (CAV), is known for its ability to selectively induce cell death in human tumor cells. Here, we show that apoptin triggers p53-independent abnormal spindle formation in osteosarcoma cells. Approximately 50% of apoptin-positive cells displayed non-bipolar spindles, a 10-fold increase as compared to control cells. Besides, tumor cells expressing apoptin are greatly limited in their progress through anaphase and telophase, and a significant drop in mitotic cells past the meta-to-anaphase transition is observed. Time-lapse microscopy showed that mitotic osteosarcoma cells expressing apoptin displayed aberrant mitotic figures and/or had a prolonged cycling time during mitosis. Importantly, all dividing cells expressing apoptin eventually underwent cell death either during mitosis or during the following interphase. We infer that apoptin can efficiently trigger cell death in dividing human tumor cells through induction of mitotic catastrophe. However, the killing activity of apoptin is not only confined to dividing cells, as the CAV-derived protein is also able to trigger caspase-3 activation and apoptosis in non-mitotic cancer cells.
