Erlotinib is an oral epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer and when combined with gemcitabine for pancreatic cancer. Dose reduction of erlotinib in patients with severe hepatic impairment has been established. We present the case of a male patient suffering from an adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with metastases in the liver and lung, whose disease progression led to highly elevated bilirubin levels of >14 mg/dl accompanied by icterus and pruritus. Despite the known contraindication, the patient agreed to be treated with 150 mg erlotinib p.o. per day. We performed therapeutic drug monitoring of erlotinib on day 1 after the first ingestion of erlotinib and then over a period of 19 days. One-compartment pharmacokinetics on day 1 were calculated, and, based on these data, a pharmacokinetic simulation for the following 19 days was run. On day 1 after the first erlotinib ingestion, plasma concentrations were identical to those described in the literature. On the following days, erlotinib plasma concentrations remained at a similar order of magnitude after daily ingestion. Compared with published data, OSI420 plasma concentrations were clearly higher from day 1 to 16. Due to disease progression, the last intake of erlotinib was on day 16, but plasma concentrations of the drug and metabolite increased excessively thereafter. The data give evidence that total bilirubin levels up to 14 mg/dl do not necessarily cause elevated plasma concentrations of erlotinib when given in doses of 150 mg per day.
