Few cancers are diagnosed based on RNA expression signatures. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is no exception; it is currently diagnosed by scalpel biopsy followed by histopathology. This study sought to identify oral tumor epithelial microRNA (miRNA) expression changes to determine if these changes could be used to diagnose the disease noninvasively. Analysis of miRNA profiles from surgically obtained OSCC tissue, collected under highly standardized conditions for The Cancer Genome Atlas, was done to determine the potential accuracy in differentiating tumor from normal mucosal tissue. Even when using small 20 subject datasets, classification based on miRNA was 90 to 100% accurate. To develop a noninvasive classifier for OSSC, analysis of brush biopsy miRNA was done and showed 87% accuracy in differentiating tumor from normal epithelium when using RT‚ÄêqPCR or miRNAseq to measure miRNAs. An extensive overlap was seen in differentially expressed miRNAs in oral squamous cell carcinoma epithelium obtained using brush biopsy and those reported in saliva and serum of oral squamous cell carcinoma patients in several studies. This suggested that nonselective release of these miRNAs into body fluids from tumor epithelium was largely responsible for the changes in levels in these fluids seen with this disease. Using a variation in mirRPath we identified the KEGG pathway of neurotrophin signaling as a target of these miRNAs disregulated in tumor epithelium. This highlights the utility of brush biopsy of oral mucosa to allow simple acquisition of cancer relevant miRNA information from tumor epithelium.
