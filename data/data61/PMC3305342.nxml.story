Protein interaction networks control virtually all cellular processes. The rules governing their evolution have remained elusive, as comprehensive protein interaction data is available for only a small number of very distant species, making evolutionary network studies difficult. Here we attempt to overcome this limitation by computationally constructing protein interaction networks for 23 relatively tightly spaced yeast species. We focus on networks consisting of kinase and peptide binding domain interactions, which play central roles in signaling pathways. These networks enable us to investigate evolutionary network mechanisms. We are able, for the first time, to accurately quantify the contribution of different rewiring mechanisms. Interaction change appears to be mainly accomplished through binding site evolution rather than through gene gain or loss. This is in contrast to other evolutionary processes, where gene duplication or deletion is a major driving factor. Moreover, our analysis reveals that interaction changes are very fast â€“ fast enough that the number of changes saturates, i.e., the actual rate of change has been strongly underestimated in previous studies. Our analysis also reveals different mechanisms by which certain interactions are conserved throughout evolution. Our results likely transfer to other species and networks, and will benefit future evolutionary studies of signaling pathways.
