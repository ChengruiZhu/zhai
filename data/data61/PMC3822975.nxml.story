The proline hydroxylase domain-containing enzymes (PHD) act as cellular oxygen sensors and initiate a hypoxic signal cascade to induce a range of cellular responses to hypoxia especially in the aspect of energy and metabolic homeostasis regulation. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is recognized as a major energetic sensor and regulator of cardiac metabolism. However, the effect of PHD signal on AMPK has never been studied before. A PHD inhibitor (PHI), dimethyloxalylglycine and PHD2-specific RNA interference (RNAi) have been used to activate PHD signalling in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Both PHI and PHD2-RNAi activated AMPK pathway in cardiomyocytes effectively. In addition, the increased glucose uptake during normoxia and enhanced myocyte viability during hypoxia induced by PHI pretreatment were abrogated substantially upon AMPK inhibition with an adenoviral vector expressing a dominant negative mutant of AMPK-α1. Furthermore, chelation of intracellular Ca2+ by BAPTA, inhibition of calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase (CaMKK) with STO-609, or RNAi-mediated down-regulation of CaMKK α inhibited PHI-induced AMPK activation significantly. In contrast, down-regulation of LKB1 with adenoviruses expressing the dominant negative form did not affect PHI-induced AMPK activation. We establish for the first time that activation of PHD signal cascade can activate AMPK pathway mainly through a Ca
