Objectives: hypermobility in Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) can manifest higher range of motions in mandible. The aim of this study was to compare the position and distances of the head of condyle to glenoid fossa in TMJs of healthy individuals and patients with mild, moderate and severe TMJ hypermobility.
Material and Methods: In this clinical study, 69 patients (between the ages of 22 to 42) with manifestation of joint hypermobility were included and Computed tomography were administered for both TMJs. The patients were divided into three groups based on their maximum mouth opening (MMO): (A) with MMO of 50-55 mm; (B) with MMO between 55 to 65 mm; and (C) with MMO >65 mm. Also, 15 healthy people with profiled tomography in the last 6 months were assumed as control group (N) with normal MMO (<50 mm). The position of condyle from articular eminence while MMO; and the distances from anterior, superior and posterior border of condyle and facing wall of glenoid fossa were measured in closed mouth from the tomography of all contributors. The collected data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA, Post Hoc and Chi-Square tests using SPSS software version 15 at significant level of 0.05.
Results: The superior and posterior distances were significantly higher in groups A, B and C than healthy individuals (all P values<0.01). The anterior distance was significant between groups B and N only in right TMJ (P=0.013).
Conclusions: TMJ hypermobility showed the characteristic of increased condylar distance in posterior and superior specially in higher excessive mouth opening.
