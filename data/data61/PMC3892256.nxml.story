Objectives: Mesiodens are the most common supernumerary teeth, occurring in 0.15% to 2.2% of the population. The aim of the present study was to analyze the frequency and radiological features of mesiodens in the pediatric population. 
Material and methods: The study was based on the radiographic evaluation of 4133 pediatric patients of the age range of 4-15 years, attending the Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology during the time period between September 2008 to December 2012. In addition to the presence of a supernumerary tooth between the 2 central incisors, data regarding the number, position, shape and associated complications were also recorded.
Results: The prevalence of mesiodens in the present study was 1.4%. The prevalence was estimated using a 95% confidence interval. The ratio of boys to girls was 1.8:1 and majority of cases (89.7%) had 1 mesiodens. Most of the mesiodens (59.6%) were aligned in a vertical position. 39 mesiodens (62.9%) were impacted, while 14 (22.6%) were partially erupted and only 9 (14.5%) were completely erupted into occlusion. The main complication associated with the mesiodens was midline diastema (28.6%) and 16 patients were asymptomatic.
Conclusion: Mesiodens can result in spacing in the arch, delayed or ectopic eruption of the permanent incisors, further altering the occlusion and esthetics of the patient or may remain asymptomatic. It is therefore important for the practitioners to diagnose a mesiodens early in development to allow for optimal treatment plan.
