Most organisms do not respond to magnetic fields. However, “magnetotactic” bacteria and migratory animals can sense geomagnetic fields and alter their behavior accordingly. These organisms often contain small magnetic particles that may be responsible for sensing magnetic fields. In magnetotactic bacteria, specific genes are crucial for the formation of these magnetic particles, but no such genes have yet been characterized in migratory animals. In humans, formation of magnetic particles can be observed in the neuronal tissue in neurodegenerative diseases. One explanation for the appearance of these magnetic particles is that they are the result of alterations in metabolism, which occur in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we explore this hypothesis by inducing magnetism in yeast cells, which are not naturally magnetic and examine how changes in metabolism contribute to particle formation and magnetism. We find that yeast cells expressing a set of human proteins that sequester iron contain iron particles and become attracted by a magnet when grown with ferric citrate. Through physiological and genetic studies we show that target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) signaling, which responds to nutritional signals, is important for the magnetization of these cells by altering the intracellular oxidation (or redox) state. We also show that genes involved in carbon metabolism affect magnetization. We propose that local redox control mediated by carbon metabolism and iron homeostasis, processes that exist in normal unmagnetized cells, are key for iron particle formation and magnetization. We conclude that magnetization of normal cells will be possible with these existing gene sets.
