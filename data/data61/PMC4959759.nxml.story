Myocardial infarction—better known as a heart attack—strikes on average every 43 seconds in America. An emerging approach to treat myocardial infarction patients involves the delivery of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) to the damaged heart. While clinical trials of this therapeutic approach have yet to report adverse effects on heart electrical rhythm, such consequences have been implicated in simpler experimental systems and thus remain a concern. In this study, we utilized mathematical modeling to simulate electrical interactions arising from direct coupling between hMSCs and human heart cells to develop insight into the possible adverse effects of this therapeutic approach on human heart electrical activity, and to assess a novel strategy for reducing some potential risks of this therapy. We developed the first mathematical models of electrical activity of three families of hMSCs based on published experimental data, and integrated these with previously established mathematical models of human heart cell electrical activity. Our computer simulations demonstrated that one particular family of hMSCs minimized the disturbances in cardiac electrical activity both at the single-cell and tissue levels, suggesting that isolating this specific sub-population of hMSCs for myocardial delivery could potentially increase the safety of future hMSC-based heart therapies.
