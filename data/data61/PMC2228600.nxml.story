The rate of active H+ secretion (JH) across the luminal cell membrane of the turtle bladder decreases linearly with the chemical (delta pH) or electrical potential gradient (delta psi) against which secretion occurs. To examine the control of JH from the cell side of the pump, acid-base changes were imposed on the cellular compartment by increasing serosal[HCO3-] at constant PCO2 or by varying PCO2 at constant [HCO3-]. When serosal [HCO3-] was increased from 0 to 60 mM, cell [H+] decreased, as estimated by the 5,5-dimethyloxazoladine-2,4- dione method. JH was a saturable function of cell [H+], with an apparent Km of 25 nM. When PCO2 was varied between 1 and 20% at various serosal Km of 25 nM. When PCO2 was varied between 1 and 20% at various serosal [HCO3-], the PCO2 required to reach a maximal JH increased with [HCO3-] so that JH was a function of cell [H+] rather than of cell [HCO3-] or CO2. The proton pump was controlled asymmetrically with respect to the pH component of the electrochemical potential for protons, microH. On the cell side of the pump, a delta pH of < 1 U was required to vary JH between maximal and zero values, whereas on the luminal side a delta pH of 3 U was required. Cell [H+] regulates JH by determining the availability of H+ to the pump in a relationship resembling Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Increasing luminal [H+] generates an energy barrier at a luminal pH near 4.4 that equals the free energy (per H+ translocated) of the metabolic driving reaction.
