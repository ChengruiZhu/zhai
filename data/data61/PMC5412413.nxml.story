 = 6) executed CPM exercise, followed by TRE. Two joint surfaces (the retropatella and femoral trochlear groove) were assessed at 4 weeks after operation. Although the gross appearance in each group was comparable, histological examination revealed significant differences in the articular cartilage status. The CPM group exhibited a greater thickness of articular cartilage, maintenance of tidemark continuity, abundant glycosaminoglycan (GAG), and significantly lower inflammatory cytokine 9, e.g., tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) 0 levels, with modest cell apoptosis (i.e., caspase-3). By contrast, the TRE group displayed the worst pathological features: an irregular cartilage surface and chondrocyte disorganization, reduced cartilage thickness, breakdown of the tidemark, depletion of collagen fibers, loss of GAG, and the highest levels of TNF-α and caspase-3 expression. Furthermore, the CPM + TRE group had more favorable outcomes than the SED group, indicating that suitable exercise is needed. The sham treatment displayed no variance in the changes in the two joint surfaces among groups. These data indicate that the application of early CPM rehabilitation is suggested for subjects in order to decrease the risk of PTOA without ACL reconstruction in the PFJ compartment in rabbits. The early TRE program, however, had harmful outcomes. Additionally, inactivity was discovered to initiate the development of PTOA.
