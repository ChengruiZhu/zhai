Current ageing theories are far from satisfactory because of the many determinants involved in ageing. The well-known rate-of-living theory assumes that the product (lifetime energy expenditure, LEE) of maximum lifespan (MLS) and mass-specific basal metabolic rate (msBMR) is approximately constant. Although this theory provides a significant inverse correlation between msBMR and MLS as a whole for mammals, it remains problematic for two reasons. First, several interspecies studies within respective orders (typically within rodents) have shown no inverse relationships between msBMR and MLS. Second, LEE values widely vary in mammals and birds. Here, to solve these two problems, we introduced a new quantity designated as mitochondrial (mt) lifetime energy output, mtLEO = MLS Ã— mtMR, in place of LEE, by using the mt metabolic rate (mtMR) per mitochondrion. Thereby, we found that mtLEO values were distributed more narrowly than LEE ones, and strongly correlated with the four amino-acid variables (AAVs) of Ser, Thr and Cys contents and hydrophobicity of mtDNA-encoded membrane proteins (these variables were related to the stability of these proteins). Consequently, only these two mt items, mtMR and the AAVs, solved the above-mentioned problems in the rate-of-living theory, and thus extensively improved the correlation with MLS compared with that given by LEE.
