Statistically, there was not any observed significant difference between Lachman and Pivot-shift levels. Positive value of Pivot-shift test and incidence of anterior translation in Lachman test were higher in the cases which were subjected to transtibial technique . There was not any statistically significant difference between Lysholm activity levels of cases. Lysholm activity levels of patients who underwent anatomic techniques significantly higher than transtibial technique. There was not any statistically significant difference between Modified Cincinnati activity levels. Modified Cincinnati activity levels of patients who were subjected anatomical techniques, are significantly higher than transtibial technique. There was not any statistically significant difference between post treatment IKDC activity levels. Intense activity after treatment rate of patient who were subjected to anatomic techniques was significantly higher than transtibial technique. There was a statistically significant differences between Cybex extension-flexion 60 measurements and Extension 240 measurements. Results of KT-1000 arthrometer testing anatomical technique was found to be stable than transtibial technique in antero-posterior translation of the knee kinematics at 20 and 30 pounds of forces. Return to sport times of patients who underwent transtibial technique, significantly higher than anatomic technique. There was not any statistically significant difference between return to work times of patients.
