 gene overexpression was able to increase the level of EETs, and subsequently prevent TNF-α induced inflammation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and macrophages. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) activation, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation, gp-91 activation, and inflammatory cytokine expression were detected by western blot analysis or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured by flow cytometry, while the migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) was detected by Transwell assay. pCMV-mediated CYP2C8 overexpression and its metabolites, EETs, markedly suppressed TNF-α induced inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and MCP-1 expression via the activation of NF-κB and degradation of IκBα. Moreover, pretreatment with 11,12-EET significantly blocked TNF-α-induced ROS production. CYP2C8-derived EETs also effectively alleviated the migration of VSMCs and improved the function of endothelial cells through the upregulation of eNOS, which was significantly decreased under the stimulation of TNF-α. Furthermore, these protective effects observed were mediated by PPARγ activation. To the best of our knowledge, the results of the present study demonstrated for the first time that CYP2C8-derived EETs exerted antivascular inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects, at least in part, through the activation of PPARγ. Thus, the
