Adriamycin, a widely used anthracycline antibiotic in multiple chemotherapy regimens, has been challenged by the cardiotoxicity leading to fatal congestive heart failure in the worst condition. The present study demonstrated that Dihydromyricetin, a natural product extracted from ampelopsis grossedentat, exerted cardioprotective effect against the injury in Adriamycin-administrated ICR mice. Dihydromyricetin decreased ALT, LDH and CKMB levels in mice serum, causing a significant reduction in the toxic death triggered by Adriamycin. The protective effects were also indicated by the alleviation of abnormal electrocardiographic changes, the abrogation of proliferation arrest and apoptotic cell death in primary myocardial cells. Further study revealed that Dihydromyricetin-rescued loss of anti-apoptosis protein ARC provoked by Adriamycin was involved in the cardioprotection. Intriguingly, the anticancer activity of Adriamycin was not compromised upon the combination with Dihydromyricetin, as demonstrated by the enhanced anticancer effect achieved by Adriamycin plus Dihydromyricetin in human leukemia U937 cells and xenograft models, in a p53-dependent manner. These results collectively promised the potential value of Dihydromyricetin as a rational cardioprotective agent of Adriamycin, by protecting myocardial cells from apoptosis, while potentiating anticancer activities of Adriamycin, thus further increasing the therapeutic window of the latter one.
