Experiments were performed to localize the hepatic microsomal enzymes of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and triacylglycerol biosynthesis to the cytoplasmic or lumenal surface of microsomal vesicles. Greater than 90 percent of the activities of fatty acid-CoA ligase (EC 6.2.1.3), sn-glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.15), lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase, diacylglycerol acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.20), diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase (EC 2.7.8.2), and diacylglycerol ethanolaminephosphotransferase (EC 2.7.8.1) was inactivated by proteolysis of intact microsomal vesicles. The phosphatidic acid phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.4) was not inactivated by any of the protease tested. Under conditions employed, <5 percent of the luminal mannose-6-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.9) activity was lost. After microsomal integrity was disrupted with detergents, protease treatment resulted in a loss of >74 percent of the mannose-6-phosphatase activity. The latency of the mannose-6-phosphatase activity was not affected by protease treatment. Mannose-6-phosphatase latency was not decreased by the presence of the assay components of several of the lipid biosynthetic activities, indicating that those components did not disrupt the microsomal vesicles. None of the lipid biosynthetic activities appeared latent. The presence of a protease-sensitive component of these biosynthetic activities on the cytoplasmic surface of microsomal vesicles, and the absence of latency for any of these biosynthetic activities suggest that the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and triacylglycerol occurs asymmetrically on the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum. The location of biosynthetic activities within the transverse plane of the endoplasmic reticulum is of particular interest for enzymes whose products may be either secreted or retained within the cell. Phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and triacylglycerol account for the vast majority of hepatic glycerolipid biosynthesis. The phospholipids are utilized for hepatic membrane biogenesis and for the formation of lipoproteins, and the triacylglycerols are incorporated into lipoproteins or accumulate within the hepatocyte in certain disease states (14). The enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of these glycerolipids (Scheme I) from fatty acids and glycerol-3P have all been localized to the microsomal subcellular fraction (12, 16, 29, 30). Microsomes are derived from the endoplasmic reticulum and are sealed vesicles which maintain proper sidedness. (11, 22). The external surface of these vesicles corresponds to the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum. Macromolecules destined for secretion must pass into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (5, 23). Uncharged molecules of up to approximately 600 daltons are able to enter the lumen of rat liver microsomes, but macromolecules and charged molecules of low molecular weight do not cross the vesicle membrane (10, 11). Because proteases neither cross the microsomal membrane nor destroy the permeability barrier of the microsomal vesicles, only the enzymes and proteins located on the cytoplasmic surface of microsomal vesicles are susceptible to proteolysis unless membrane integrity is disrupted (10, 11). By use of this approach, several enzymes and proteins have been localized in the transverse plane of microsomal membranes (11). With the possible exception of cytochrome P 450, all of the enzymes and proteins investigated were localized asymmetrically by the proteolysis technique (11). By studies of this type, as well as by product localization, glucose-6-phosphate (EC 3.1.3.9) has been localized to the luminal surface of microsomal vesicles (11) and of the endoplasmic reticulum (18, 19). All microsomal vesicles contain glucose-6-phosphatase (18, 19) which can effectively utilize mannose-6-P as a substrate, provided the permeability barrier of the vesicles has been disrupted to allow the substrate access to the active site located on the lumenal surface (4). An exact correspondence between mannose- 6-phosphate activity and membrane permeability to EDTA has been established (4). The latency of mannose-6-phosphatase activity provides a quantitative index of microsomal integrity (4.) Few of the microsomal enzymes in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and triacylglycerol have been solubilized and/or purified, and little is known about the topography of these enzymes in the transverse or lateral planes of the endoplasmic reticulum. An asymmetric location of these biosynthetic enzymes on the cytoplasmic or lumenal surface of microsomal vesicles may provide a mechanism for regulation of the glycerolipids to be retained or secreted by the cell, and for the biogenesis of asymmetric phospholipid bilayers. In this paper, we report investigations on the localization of all seven microsomal enzymes (Scheme I) in the biosynthesis of triacylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine, using the protease technique with mannose-6-phosphatase serving as luminal control activity. The latency of these lipid biosynthetic enzymes was also investigated, using the latency of mannose-6-phosphatase as an index of microsomal integrity.
