Multiple myeloma (MM) is thrombogenic as a consequence of multiple hemostatic effects. Thalidomide is an effective treatment; however, it has been associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events including pulmonary hypertension (PH). PH in the absence of thromboembolic events has also been described in some patients with MM during thalidomide treatment. We experienced occurrence of PH in a MM patient during treatment with thalidomide. A 79-year-old woman was diagnosed with IgG lambda MM and was started on thalidomide treatment. About a month later, she presented with asthenia, palpitation and dyspnoea on exertion and was hospitalized. An echocardiography revealed severe PH (systolic pulmonary artery pressure 75 mm Hg) without paradoxic movement of ventricular septum or right ventricular dysfunction signs; a previous echocardiography was normal. Pulmonary computed tomography and perfusion scan were negative for pulmonary embolism. Based on the hypothesis of a pharmacological pathogenesis, thalidomide was promptly interrupted. About a month later, she was hospitalized for further investigations. Physical examination documented absence of dyspnoea or other respiratory signs, and echocardiography showed normal right ventricular function and normal pulmonary artery pressure. As in the cases reported in the literature, we suggest a possible direct correlation between thalidomide and PH, since in all cases a rapid decrease of pulmonary artery pressure after thalidomide discontinuation was observed.
