Neuroblastoma (NBL) is the most common extra-cranial tumour in childhood. It can present as an abdominal mass, but is usually metastatic at diagnosis so the symptomatology can be varied. Nephroblastoma, also more commonly known as a Wilms tumour, is the commonest renal tumour in childhood and more typically presents as abdominal pathology with few constitutional symptoms, although rarely haematuria can be a presenting feature. The pathophysiology and clinical aspects of both tumours including associated risk factors and pathologies are discussed. Oncogenetics and chromosomal abnormalities are increasingly recognised as important prognostic indicators and their impact on initial management is considered. Imaging plays a pivotal role in terms of diagnosis and recent imaging advances mean that radiology has an increasingly crucial role in the management pathway. The use of image defined risk factors in neuroblastoma has begun to dramatically change how this tumour is characterised pre-operatively. The National Wilms Tumour Study Group have comprehensively staged Wilms tumours and this is reviewed as it impacts significantly on management. The use of contrast-enhanced MRI and diffusion-weighted sequences have further served to augment the information available to the clinical team during initial assessment of both neuroblastomas and Wilms tumours. The differences in management strategies are outlined. This paper therefore aims to provide a comprehensive update on these two common paediatric tumours with a particular emphasis on the current crucial role played by imaging.
