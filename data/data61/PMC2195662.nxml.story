Differentiation of human T cells into T helper (Th)1 and Th2 cells is vital for the development of cell-mediated and humoral immunity, respectively. However, the precise mechanism responsible for the Th1 cell differentiation is not fully clarified. We have studied the expression and function of Txk, a member of the Tec family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. We found that Txk expression is restricted to Th1/Th0 cells with IFN-γ producing potential. Txk transfection of Jurkat T cells resulted in a several-fold increase of IFN-γ mRNA expression and protein production; interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-4 production were unaffected. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotide of Txk specifically inhibited IFN-γ production of normal peripheral blood lymphocytes, antigen-specific Th1 clones, and Th0 clones; IL-2 and IL-4 production by the T cells was unaffected. Txk cotransfection led to the enhanced luciferase activity of plasmid (p)IFN-γ promoter/enhancer (pIFN-γ[-538])-luciferase–transfected Jurkat cells upon mitogen activation. Txk transfection did not affect IL-2 and IL-4 promoter activities. Thus, Txk specifically upregulates IFN-γ gene transcription. In fact, Txk translocated from cytoplasm into nuclei upon activation and transfection with a mutant Txk expression plasmid that lacked a nuclear localization signal sequence did not enhance IFN-γ production by the cells, indicating that nuclear localization of Txk is obligatory for the enhanced IFN-γ production. In addition, IL-12 treatment of peripheral blood CD4
