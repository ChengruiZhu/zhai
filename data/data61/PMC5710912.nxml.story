Although a multicenter, randomized study indicated that induction chemotherapy (IC) with docetaxel/cisplatin/fluorouracil (TPF) before concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) improves survival outcomes, it remains unclear whether TPF is the best IC regimen for treating locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Our aim was to compare the efficacy and toxicities of TPF vs. docetaxel/cisplatin (TP) IC followed by CCRT in patients with locoregionally advanced NPC. One hundred thirty-two patients with locoregionally advanced NPC received 21-day cycles of IC with either TPF or TP. Both were followed by intensity-modulated radiotherapy concurrent with the cisplatin treatment every 3 weeks. Three-year rates of locoregional relapse-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, progression-free survival, and overall survival were respectively 96.4%, 87.7%, 86.0%, and 94.7% for patients in the TPF arm patients and 90.3%, 91.9%, 85.2%, and 92.0% for patients in the TP arm. There were no differences in survival between the two arms. Multivariate analysis revealed the IC regimen was not an independent prognostic factor for any survival outcome. However, patients in the TP arm experienced fewer grade 3/4 toxicities. In sum, IC with docetaxel and cisplatin is associated with similar efficacy and less toxicity than the TPF regimen. Addition of fluorouracil to docetaxel plus cisplatin IC is therefore not recommended for patients with locoregionally advanced NPC.
