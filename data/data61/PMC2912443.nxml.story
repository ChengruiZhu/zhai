Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic γ-herpes virus associated with malignancies that develop in both lymphoid and epithelial cells including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The EBV protein latent membrane protein 2A (LMP2A) is expressed in NPC and can modulate epithelial proliferation, transformation, and differentiation, and as such, may promote malignancy. A key regulator of epithelial cell differentiation is the transcription factor p63, a member of the p53 family. This study examines the potential contribution of p63 to LMP2A-mediated inhibition of epithelial differentiation. Stable expression of LMP2A increased the protein level and stability of the ΔNp63α isoform, and in two epithelial cell lines, LMP2A interacted with ΔNp63α under stable and transient expression systems. LMP2A and ΔNp63α were localized to the cytoplasm and nuclear membrane and co-immunoprecipitated in the same fractions. Following induction of epithelial cell differentiation by calcium, expression of differentiation markers was impaired in both ΔNp63α and LMP2 expressing cells. Induction of p63α, association of p63α with LMP2A, and impairment of differentiation required the PY and ITAM signaling motif of LMP2A. By associating with and being regulated by LMP2A,ΔNp63α may function as a unique regulator of LMP2A effects on epithelial differentiation and contribute to EBV-associated epithelial cancers.
