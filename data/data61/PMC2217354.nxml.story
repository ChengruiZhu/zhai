We have investigated the interactions of a novel anionic ryanoid, 10-O-succinoylryanodol, with individual mammalian cardiac muscle ryanodine receptor channels under voltage clamp conditions. As is the case for all ryanoids so far examined, the interaction of 10-O-succinoylryanodol with an individual RyR channel produces profound alterations in both channel gating and rates of ion translocation. In the continued presence of the ryanoid the channel fluctuates between periods of normal and modified gating, indicating a reversible interaction of the ligand with its receptor. Unlike the majority of ryanoids, we observe a range of different fractional conductance states of RyR in the presence of 10-O-succinoylryanodol. We demonstrate that 10-O-succinoylryanodol is a very flexible molecule and propose that each fractional conductance state arises from the interaction of a different conformer of the ryanoid molecule with the RyR channel. The probability of channel modification by 10-O-succinoylryanodol is dependent on the transmembrane holding potential. Comparison of the voltage dependence of channel modification by this novel anionic ryanoid with previous data obtained with cationic and neutral ryanoids reveals that the major influence of transmembrane potential on the probability of RyR channel modification by ryanoids results from an alteration in receptor affinity. These investigations also demonstrate that the charge of the ryanoid has a major influence on the rate of association of the ligand with its receptor indicating that ionic interactions are likely to be involved in this reaction.
