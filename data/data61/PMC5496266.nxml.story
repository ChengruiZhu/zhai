When hepatocytes are damaged severely, a variety of signaling pathways will be triggered by inflammatory factors and cytokines involving in the process of hepatic fibrosis. The microRNA (miRNA) family consists of several miRNAs which have the potential for synergistic regulation of these signaling pathways. However, it is poor to understand the roles of miRNA family as a whole in hepatic fibrosis. Increasing studies have suggested several miRNA families are related with activation of hepatic stellate cells and hepatic fibrosis through cooperatively regulating certain signaling pathways. During the process of hepatic fibrosis, miR-29 family primarily induces cell apoptosis by modulating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT signaling pathway and regulates extracellular matrix accumulation. miR-34 family promotes the progression of hepatic fibrosis by inducing activation of hepatic stellate cells, while miR-378 family suppresses the process in Glis dependent manner. miR-15 family mainly promotes cell proliferation and induces apoptosis. The miR-199 family and miR-200 family are responsible for extracellular matrix deposition and the release of pro-fibrotic cytokines. These miRNA family members play pro-fibrotic or anti-fibrotic roles by targeting genes collectively or respectively which involve in hepatic fibrosis related signaling pathways and hepatic stellate cell activation. Thus, good understandings of molecular mechanisms which are based on miRNA families may provide new ideas for the molecular targeted therapy of hepatic fibrosis in the future.
