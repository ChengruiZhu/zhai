We have determined the effect of various endocytic ligands on the secretion of ApoE by macrophages. ApoE was a major secreted protein of resident macrophages, but BCG-activated macrophages secreted little ApoE and periodate-elicited macrophages secreted intermediate amounts of ApoE. Resident, periodate-elicited, and BCG-activated mouse peritoneal macrophages were incubated with AcLDL, EIgG, EIgMC, dextran sulfate, latex, or zymosan, and the resulting protein secretion patterns were analyzed by [35S]methionine labeling and SDS- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. AcLDL increased total [35S]methionine incorporation into secreted proteins. Although AcLDL increased the secretion of ApoE by resident macrophages less than or equal to fivefold in a dose-dependent manner, with maximal stimulation at 4.8 micrograms/ml, it decreased the secretion of ApoE by periodate- elicited macrophages to almost nothing and did not affect the low rate of secretion of ApoE by BCG-activated macrophages. However, EIgG, which increases cellular cholesterol content of macrophages as AcLDL does, did not increase ApoE secretion, and dextran sulfate, which is recognized by the same receptor as AcLDL, also did not increase ApoE secretion. The binding and uptake of EIgG, dextran sulfate, zymosan, latex, and EIgMC all decreased the secretion of ApoE. These endocytic ligands also altered the pattern of secreted and cellular proteins other than ApoE. The pattern of response was ligand-specific. However, increased secretion of polypeptides of Mr 62,000 and 68,000 was common to many stimuli. We conclude that receptor-mediated endocytosis modulates the secretion of ApoE and other proteins pleiotypically in resident, inflammatory, and activated macrophages.
