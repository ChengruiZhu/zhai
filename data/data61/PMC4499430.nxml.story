Medication errors are commonly encountered in hospital setting. Intravenous medications pose particular risks because of their greater complexity and the multiple steps required in their preparation, administration and monitoring. We aimed to determine the rate of errors during the preparation and administration phase of intravenous medications and the correlation of these errors with the demographics of nurses involved in the process. One hundred patients who were receiving IV medications were monitored by a trained pharmacist. The researcher accompanied the nurses during the preparation and administration process of IV medications. Collected data were compared with the acceptable guidelines. A checklist was filled for each IV medication. Demographic data of the nurses were collected as well. A total of 454 IV medications were recorded. Inappropriate administration rate constituted a large proportion of errors in our study (35.3%). No significant or life threatening drug interaction was recorded during the study. Evaluating the impact of the nurses’ demographic characteristics on the incidence of medication errors showed that there is a direct correlation between nurses’ employment status and the rate of medication errors, while other characteristics did not show a significant impact on the rate of administration errors. Administration errors were significantly higher in temporary 1-year contract group than other groups (
