The aims of this study were to cross-validate three clinical-grade measures of body composition, using an octopolar Bioelectrical Impedance (BIA), an ultrasound analyzer (US) and Air-Displacement Plethysmography (ADP) and second to compare the US scans of total abdominal, subcutaneous and visceral fat depths (mm) against the trunk percent fat (%BF) from the octopolar BIA. Twenty-six college-aged (22.9 ± 1.35 years) men (n = 18) and women (n = 8) volunteered to participate in this study. Body composition was assessed using BIA (total and by segments), ADP and US. In addition, total abdominal, subcutaneous and visceral fat layers were measured using the US. All measurements were done in accordance with manufacturers’ guidelines. The %BF comparing the three clinical grade machines were all significantly correlated and no significant differences were found using a 1-way ANOVA. All three fat depths were significantly correlated to the trunk fat % via BIA, while significant differences were found for the 1-way ANOVA. A Tukey post-hoc test showed significant differences between the BIA trunk %BF and both subcutaneous and visceral US fat depths. Having valid ways to measure body composition and visceral fat that is accessible in terms of being transportable, cost effective, and simple to use, should become a part of preventive medicine.
