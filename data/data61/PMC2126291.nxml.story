 obtained from pure cultures of several different strains, in order to determine whether or not an active immunity against a subsequent infection with virulent organisms would develop in the vaccinated animals. The experiments were so arranged as to make possible a determination of the existence of immunity against homologous strains as well as against the strains not employed as vaccine, and a brief quantitive estimation of the degree and duration of the immunity in relation to the quantities of the vaccines inoculated. Following the general rule of prophylactic inoculations with various pathogenic organisms, the inoculations were repeated subcutaneously on three consecutive occasions at intervals of 5 days. With respect to the amounts of vaccine, the experiments were divided into three groups for each vaccine, one group receiving three doses of 0.5 cc., the second three of 0.05 cc., and the third three of 0.005 cc. Four different strains were employed as vaccines, American Strain 1, American Strain 2, and one each of the Japanese and the European strains. The determination of the development, degree, and duration of the immunity was made by inoculating intraperitoneally several minimum lethal doses of each of the five following strains: American Strains 1, 2, and 3, the Japanese, and the European strains. The virulence of the different strains varied considerably, the strongest being the Japanese strain, which killed the guinea pig in a dose of 0.00001 cc., and the weakest American Strain 3, the minimum lethal dose of which was as large as 0.01 cc. The vaccinated guinea pigs were tested for immunity at the end of 2, 4, and 8 weeks after the last inoculation. The results obtained show that three successive inoculations of 0.5 cc. of the emulsions of killed cultures of
