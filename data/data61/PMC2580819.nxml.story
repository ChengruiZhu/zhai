No DNA molecule is preserved after a few hundred thousand years, so inferring the DNA sequence organization of ancient living organisms beyond several million years can only be achieved by computational estimations, using the similarities and differences between chromosomes of extant species. This is the scope of “paleogenomics”, and it can help to better understand how genomes have evolved until today. We propose here a computational framework to estimate contiguous segments of ancestral chromosomes, based on techniques of physical mapping that are used to infer chromosome maps of extant species when their genome is not sequenced. This framework is not guided by possible evolutionary events such as rearrangements but only proposes ancestral genome architectures. We developed a method following this framework and applied it to mammalian genomes. We inferred ancestral chromosomal regions that are stable and well supported at different levels of resolution. These ancestral chromosomal regions agree with previous cytogenetics studies and were very probably part of the genome of the common ancestor of humans, macaca, mice, dogs, and cows, living 120 million years ago. We illustrate, through comparison with other bioinformatics methods, the importance of a formal methodological background when comparing ancestral genome architecture proposals obtained from different methods.
