Regulation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) gene plays an important role in controlling the metabolism of lipids and inflammatory processes. Therefore, it can be associated with the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome (MetS). The purpose of this study was to determine the expression of this gene in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in patients with metabolic syndrome. Using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), mRNA expression of PPAR-γ was found in PBMC from 37 subjects with MetS and 30 healthy controls. Serum levels of glucose and lipid profiles were measured. The total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was measured using the ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) test. Malondialdehyde (MDA) was determined using a fluorimetric method. Total oxidant status (TOS) in serum was assayed according to oxidation of ferric to ferrous in the presence of methyl orange. Super oxide dismutase (SOD) activity was measured using a Randox kit. Expression of PPAR-γ gene was significantly increased in patients with MetS compared to the control subjects (p=0.002). There was no difference in serum levels of TAC, MDA and SOD between the two study groups, but a significant difference was observed in the TOS (p=0.03). Serum levels of triglycerides and glucose were significantly higher in subjects with MetS. According to the results of our study, an increase in the expression of PPAR-γ in subjects with MetS indicated a possible role of PPAR-γ in the pathogenesis of this disease.
