Desmoid tumors, also known as aggressive fibromatosis, are tumors of intermediate dignity, which grow slowly but are locally aggressive. These tumors do not metastasize but can be potentially life threatening when infiltrating vital structures. The therapy strategy consists of surgery, radiation and systemic therapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antiestrogen compounds and cytotoxic chemotherapy. We report on a 40-year-old male patient with advanced fibromatosis of the neck who has been treated with 7 cycles of polychemotherapy (adriablastin, ifosfamide and dacarbazine) followed by targeted therapy with imatinib. Tumor response was evaluated clinically and by magnetic resonance imaging. The tumor decreased significantly after the first cycle of chemotherapy and tumor-related symptoms declined. The response continued after switching to targeted therapy with imatinib, which is currently ongoing. The best treatment for this rare tumor remains under discussion. Doxorubicin and dacarbazine are frequently used agents. We included ifosfamide in our therapy, which is standard in the treatment of soft tissue tumors. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib seems to offer new possibilities and is currently investigated in randomized trials. We conclude that combination chemotherapy including doxorubicin, ifosfamide and dacarbazine in the treatment of aggressive fibromatosis should be considered for patients suffering from unresectable, advanced disease and clinical symptoms which require a rapid response to therapy.
