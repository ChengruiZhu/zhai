When studying how e.g. diseases spread in a population, intermittent contacts taking place between individuals—through which the infection spreads—are best described by a time-varying network. This object captures both their complex structure and dynamics, which crucially affect spreading in the population. The dynamical process in question is then usually studied by simulating it on the time-varying network representing the population. Such simulations are usually time-consuming, especially when they require exploration of different parameter values. We here show how to adapt an algorithm originally proposed in 1976 to simulate chemical reactions—the Gillespie algorithm—to speed up such simulations. Instead of checking at each time-step if each possible reaction takes place, as traditional rejection sampling algorithms do, the Gillespie algorithm determines what reaction takes place next and at what time. This offers a substantial speed gain by doing away with the many rejected trials of the traditional methods, with the added benefit of giving stochastically exact results. In practice this new temporal Gillespie algorithm is tens to hundreds of times faster than the current state-of-the-art, opening up for thorough characterization of spreading phenomena and fast large-scale applications such as the simulation of city- or world-wide epidemics.
