Burnout is a serious problem facing the majority of oncologists. Many medical students may regard oncology as depressive part of medicine. This false picture may discourage them from choosing oncology as their future specialization. To learn problems experienced by oncologists and to answer the students’ question: is it dangerous to choose oncology? We conducted an anonymous survey among 69 oncologists. Young doctors (up to 5 years of service) accounted for 31 %, specialists 69 %, with a median length of practice of 14 years. The most frequently reported symptoms included irritability (84 %) and tension (74 %). Forty-five percent reported headaches, 25 % sleep disorders, 51 % negative impact on their personal lives. Excessive bureaucratization, overwork, and haste, with the disparity between undertaken effort and compensation were the most common sources of stress. Stress reduction methods were as follows: their relationship with family and/or friends (69 %), reading books/watching movies (66 %), emotional distance from their problems (63 %), and contact with nature (62 %). Ninety-six percent of physicians were satisfied with their choice of pursuing work with cancer patients. However, as many as 49 % of oncologists experienced moments of doubt regarding their sense of vocation. Students and young doctors considering pursuing an oncological speciality should not be discouraged by the likely degree of sacrifice or burden, but rather aim to develop effective ways to reduce stress, along with remembering one’s own health needs. This could be valuable part of both pregradual and postgradual medical education, worth to become part of medical curricula.
