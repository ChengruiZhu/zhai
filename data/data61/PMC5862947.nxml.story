Easy isolation, lack of ethical issues, high proliferation, multi-lineage differentiation potential and immunomodulatory properties of umbilical cord (UC)-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) make them a valuable tool in stem cell research. Recently, Wharton’s jelly (WJ) was proven as the best MSC source among various compartments of UC. However, it is still unclear whether or not Wharton’s jelly-derived MSCs (WJMSCs) from different parts of the whole cord exhibit the same characteristics. There may be varied MSCs present in different parts of WJ throughout the length of the UC. For this purpose, using an explant attachment method, WJMSCs were isolated from three different parts of the UC, mainly present towards the placenta (mother part), the center of the whole cord (central part) and the part attached to the fetus (baby part). WJMSCs from all three parts were maintained in normal growth conditions (10% ADMEM) and analyzed for mesenchymal markers, pluripotent genes, proliferation rate and tri-lineage differentiation potential. All WJMSCs were highly proliferative, positively expressed CD90, CD105, CD73 and vimentin, while not expressing CD34, CD45, CD14, CD19 or HLA-DR, differentiated into adipocytes, osteocytes and chondrocytes and expressed pluripotency markers OCT-4, SOX-2 and NANOG at gene and protein levels. Furthermore, MSCs derived from all the parts were shown to have potency towards hepatocyte-like cell differentiation. Human bone marrow-derived MSCs were used as a positive control. Finally, we conclude that WJMSCs derived from all the parts are valuable sources and can be efficiently used in various fields of regenerative medicine.
