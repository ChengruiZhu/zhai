The complexity of the blood plasma was first revealed by the Nobel Prize laureate, Arne Tiselius and Theodor Svedberg, which resulted in the identification of thousands of plasma proteins. Among all these proteins, four of which are commercially important for production due to significant need of patients. These four products are: albumin, IgG, factor VIII, and Factor IX. The starting material for the production of biological drugs from plasma is natural which is different from synthetic starting material. So, the quality of plasma as starting material plays an important role in the quality of final product. Introducing new techniques for preparation of the biological drugs from human plasma has resulted in the improvements in purity of products, higher safety, and yield noticeably. Still, the backbone of the modern plasma fractionation technique is mainly based on cold ethanol fractionation of the human plasma that is almost the same as fractionation of crude oil, breaking it down into its components. The demand for IgG for treating immune deficiencies and coagulation factor VIII for hemophilia A determines how to design the plasma fractionation industry in terms of capacity. Nowadays, cold ethanol fractionation has followed by chromatographic methods, since they offer higher purity. In this review, we describe different methods of plasma fractionation such as cold ethanol fractionation, gel filtration, fractionation by salt, and fractionation by polyethylene glycol. There is no doubt that the four main products of human plasma are albumin, IgG, coagulation factor VIII, and IX, which their methods of separation from human plasma have been explained in this paper.
