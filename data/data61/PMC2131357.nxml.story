 have been isolated, by means of the semisolid leptospira medium, from nine of twelve specimens of blood withdrawn from cases of verruga and forwarded from Peru under conditions of refrigeration. The cultural titer of the blood specimens immediately after their arrival (2 weeks after withdrawal) varied from 1:10 to 1:100,000. Blood from the severe anemic type of the disease, in which there was no eruption, had the highest titer. Blood agar slants yielded irregular results, but some strains grew well on these media. Morphologically the strains differed very little in fresh preparations examined by dark-ground illumination. In stained preparations some strains appeared coarser, others finer than the average. Special staining indicated that the flagella were characteristically unipolar and varied in number from one to four, some strains showing distinctly more wavy and heavier flagella than others. Young cultures grown on the surface of horse blood agar for 3 to 6 days show individuals with fairly sharp contours, short rods, often varying in thickness toward one or both ends, being intermingled with smaller oval or coccoid elements. Some strains show a predominance of bacillary, some of coccobacillary forms. It is not known whether these features are inherent or are due to conditions of growth, which, though identical, may react differently upon different strains. Definiteness in outline disappears with the age of the culture. More striking variations are found in the virulence of the different strains for the monkey ( and is modified secondarily by individual predisposition in a given case. An interesting phenomenon brought out by the present investigation was the failure of the nine human blood specimens to induce local verruga in the same monkeys in which the corresponding cultures, inoculated simultaneously at separate sites, gave rise to typical lesions. Yet the original blood samples were shown by cultivation to have contained live bartonellas at the time they were inoculated, and blood culture revealed the presence of the microorganisms in the blood of monkeys which showed no other signs of infection after inoculation with the human blood. Whether this striking difference is merely a quantitative one or is due to some factor still unknown—such as, for example, a biological phase of the microorganism—has not been determined. The uniformly negative results of transmission experiments with blood by previous investigators is explained by an actual inability of the blood to induce skin lesions and the lack, until now, of a reliable method of detecting
