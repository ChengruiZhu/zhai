Microglia are important players in immune responses to brain injury. In the event of pathological insults, microglia rapidly become activated and acquire the ability to release various inflammatory molecules that influence neuronal survival as well as synaptic function and plasticity. Similarly to macrophages in other areas of the body, activated microglia can engulf, or phagocytose, cellular debris and are believed to eliminate synapses. In the absence of pathological insult, microglia are more quiescent, but still, these immune surveillants continually sample their surrounding environment and contact neighboring cells and synapses. To further explore the roles of microglia at synapses under non-pathological conditions, we used quantitative electron microscopy and two-photon in vivo imaging to characterize the interactions between quiescent microglia and synaptic elements in the visual cortex of juvenile mice. We also examined the “activity-dependent” processes involved by preventing light exposure in a group of mice. We show surprising changes in microglial behavior during alterations in visual experience, such as increased phagocytosis of synaptic elements and interaction with subsets of structurally dynamic and transient synapses. These observations suggest that microglia may participate in the modification or elimination of synaptic structures, and therefore actively contribute to learning and memory in the healthy brain.
