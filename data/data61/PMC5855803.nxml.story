The aggravation of renal interstitial fibrosis in the advanced-stage of chronic kidney disease is related to decreased matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity, which is induced by hypoxia in the kidney; however, the specific mechanism remains unclear. We previously demonstrated that inhibition of Caveolin-1, a key gene involved in endocytosis, increased MMP-2 activity in hypoxic HK-2 cells. It has been reported that activated Src (phospho-Src Tyr416) is a key molecule in multiple fibrotic pathways. However, whether Src functions on the regulation of Caveolin-1 and MMP-2 activity in hypoxic HK-2 cells remains poorly understood. To explore the underlying mechanism, a rat model of renal interstitial fibrosis was established, then we observed obvious hypoxia in fibrotic kidney tissue and the protein levels of phospho-Src and Caveolin-1 increased, while MMP-2 activity decreased. Next, we treated HK-2 cells with the phospho-Src inhibitor PP1. Compared with normal cells grown in hypoxia, in cells treated with PP1, the protein levels of phospho-Src and Caveolin-1 decreased, as did the protein levels of the MMP-2-activity-regulated molecules RECK (reversion-inducing-cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifs) and TIMP-2 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2), while the protein level of MT1-MMP (membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase) increased and MMP-2 activity was enhanced. Therefore, hypoxia promotes the phosphorylation of Src and phospho-Src can enhance the endocytosis of HK-2 cells, which leads to decreased MMP-2 activity and aggravates renal interstitial fibrosis.
