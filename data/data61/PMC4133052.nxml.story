Experimental evidence has recently been accumulating to suggest that fitness landscape ruggedness is common in a variety of organisms. Rugged landscapes arise from interactions between genetic variants, called epistasis, which can lead to fitness valleys or plateaus. The time needed to cross such fitness valleys or plateaus exhibits a rich dependence on population size, since stochastic effects have higher importance in small populations, increasing the probability of fixation of neutral or deleterious mutants. This may lead to an advantage of population subdivision, a possibility which has been strongly debated for nearly one hundred years. In this work, we quantitatively determine when, and to what extent, population subdivision accelerates valley and plateau crossing. Using the simple model of an asexual population subdivided into identical demes connected by gobal migration, we derive the conditions under which crossing by a subdivided population is driven by its fastest deme, thus giving rise to the maximal speedup. Our analytical predictions are verified using stochastic simulations. We investigate the effect of varying the degree of subdivision of a population. We generalize our results to weakly beneficial intermediates and to different population structures. We discuss the magnitude and robustness of the effect for realistic parameter values.
