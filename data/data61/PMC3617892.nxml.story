Pars planitis (PP) is an intermediate form of uveitis, which, if left untreated, can result in vision loss. Although phacoemulsification with IOL implantation in eyes with PP often results in improved vision, it represents a surgical challenge due to inflammatory sequelae and the possibility of postoperative complications. This case report describes a 4-year-old male who was admitted for poor visual acuity and severe photophobia. The patient previously received vitreo-retinal surgery on his right eye due to an ‘unknown disease’. Ophthalmological evaluation revealed NLP, pupillary seclusion and band keratopathy in the right eye; echographic scans revealed funnel retinal detachment. The left eye had a visual acuity of CF at 1 foot, minimal band keratopathy, posterior synechiae and the following echographic findings: abundant vitreous opacities and increased chorioretinal thickness (1.6 mm). Complete medical and laboratory assessments found no infectious pathologies. The patient was diagnosed with PP. Anti-inflammatory and immunological therapy was given in order to control inflammation. Within four months, the inflammation was controlled. Slow motion phacoemulsification with iris-retractors was performed. During the surgery, an unexpected challenge was identified: an opaque-vascular retrolental membrane. The membrane was cauterized with diathermy. Primary posterior capsulotomy and membranectomy were performed, followed by a limited anterior vitrectomy. An in-the-bag IOL was implanted successfully, with no postoperative complications, and visual acuity improved to 20/200.
