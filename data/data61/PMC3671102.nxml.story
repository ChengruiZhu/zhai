Bariatric surgery is now widely accepted for treatment of morbid obesity. This study compared the effects of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) on excess weight loss (EWL) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). PubMed and Embase were searched for publications concerning LAGB and LSG from 2000 to 2012, with the last search on August 17, 2012. EWL and T2DM improvement over 6 and 12 months were pooled and compared by meta-analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) and mean differences were calculated with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Eleven studies involving 1,004 patients met the inclusion criteria. Compared with LAGB, LSG achieved greater EWL. The mean percentage EWL for LAGB was 33.9 % after 6 months in six studies and 37.8 % after 12 months in four studies; for LSG, EWL was 50.6 % after 6 months and 51.8 % after 12 months in the same studies. LSG was also superior to LAGB in treating T2DM. In five studies, T2DM was improved in 42 of 68 (61.8 %) patients after LAGB and 66 of 80 (82.5 %) after LSG, representing a pooled OR of 0.34 (95 % CI 0.16–0.73) and pooled mean differences of −12.55 (95 % CI −15.66 to −9.43) and −4.97 (95 % CI −7.58 to −8.36), respectively. LSG is more effective than LAGB in morbid obesity, with higher percentage EWL and greater improvement in T2DM.
