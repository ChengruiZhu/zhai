, the pyran ring has a flattened-boat con­formation, with the 1,4-related ether O and methine C atoms lying 0.1205 (18) and 0.271 (2) Å, respectively, above the least-squares plane involving the doubly bonded C atoms (r.m.s deviation = 0.0208 Å). An envelope conformation is found for the cyclo­hexene ring, with the flap atom being the middle methyl­ene C atom, lying 0.616 (2) Å out of the plane defined by the remaining atoms (r.m.s. deviation = 0.0173 Å). The fused four-ring system is approximately planar, with the dihedral angle between the least-squares planes through the cyclo­hexene and naphthyl rings being 10.78 (7)°. The tris­ubstituted benzene ring occupies a position almost perpendicular to the pyran ring [dihedral angle = 83.97 (4)°]. The most prominent feature of the packing is the formation of zigzag supra­molecular chains mediated by aryl-C—H⋯O(meth­oxy) inter­actions; chains are connected into a three-dimensional architecture by methyl­ene- and methyl-C—H⋯π inter­actions. The prevalence of C—H⋯O and C—H⋯π inter­actions is confirmed by an analysis of the Hirshfeld surface. A comparison with related structures suggests that the mol­ecular conformation of the title compound is relatively robust with respect to varying substitution patterns at the methine C atom of the pyran ring.
