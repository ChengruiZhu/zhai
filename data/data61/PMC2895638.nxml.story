Neurons produce a myriad of action potentials with different shapes and varying heights and widths; underlying these action potentials are highly nonlinear, voltage-dependent ionic conductances with varying biophysical properties. Each action potential comes at a cost: the brain uses a substantial portion of its total energy budget to generate and propagate action potentials. Recent results show that some mammalian action potentials have biophysical properties that make them energy efficient. Yet, how widespread are energy efficient action potentials? Using mathematical analysis and modeling, we show that there is no direct relationship between the height, width, and the energy consumption of a single action potential. Furthermore, we establish that many mammalian action potentials have biophysical properties that reduce the overlap between their inward and outward currents so as to minimize energy consumption. This reduction in overlap results from a combination of ion channel properties uniquely tailored for each particular neuron type and the functional purpose of the action potential in that neuron. By comparing the measured biophysical parameters to the parameters produced by numerical optimization for maximal energy-efficiency, we argue that natural selection for energy-efficiency could help explain both the shape of the action potential and the underlying biophysics of ionic currents.
