The potential relationship of cell adhesion to embryonic induction during feather formation was examined by immunohistochemical analysis of the spatiotemporal distribution of three cell-adhesion molecules (CAMs), neural CAM (N-CAM), liver CAM (L-CAM), and neuron-glia CAM (Ng- CAM), and of substrate molecules (laminin and fibronectin) in embryonic chicken skin. The N-CAM found at sites of embryonic induction in the feather was found to be similar to brain N-CAM as judged by immuno- cross-reactivity, migratory position in PAGE, and the presence of embryonic to adult conversion. In contrast to the N-CAM found in the brain, however, only one polypeptide of Mr 140,000 was seen. N-CAM- positive dermal condensations were distributed periodically under L-CAM- positive feather placodes at those sites where basement membranes are known to be disrupted. After initiation of induction, L-CAM-positive placode cells became transiently N-CAM-positive. N-CAM was asymmetrically concentrated in the dorsal region of the feather bud, while fibronectin was concentrated in the ventral region. During feather follicle formation, N-CAM was expressed in the dermal papilla and was closely apposed to the L-CAM-positive papillar ectoderm, while the dermal papilla showed no evidence of laminin or fibronectin. The collar epithelium was both N-CAM- and L-CAM-positive. During the formation of the feather filament, N-CAM appeared periodically and asymmetrically on basilar cells located in the valleys between adjacent barb ridges. In contrast to the two primary CAMs, Ng-CAM was found only on nerves supplying the feather and the skin. These studies indicate that at each site of induction during feather morphogenesis, a general pattern is repeated in which an epithelial structure linked by L-CAM is confronted with periodically propagating condensations of cells linked by N-CAM.
