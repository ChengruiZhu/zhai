Lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Aberrant expression of genes expressed preferentially in the lung tumor vasculature may yield clues for prognosis and treatment. Von Willebrand factor (vWF) is a large multifunctional glycoprotein with a well-known function in hemostasis. However, vWF has been reported to exert an anti-tumor effect, independent of its role in hemostasis. We investigated the expression of vWF in LAC through immunohistochemical staining of tumor tissue microarrays (TMAs). We found that vWF was overexpressed preferentially in the tumor vasculature of LAC compared with the adjacent tissue vasculature. Consistently, elevated vWF expression was found in endothelial cells (ECs) of fresh human LAC tissues and transplanted mouse LAC tissues. To understand the mechanism underlying vWF up-regulation in LAC vessels, we established a co-culture system. In this system, conditioned media (CM) collected from A549 cells increased vWF expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), suggesting enhanced expression is regulated by the LAC secretome. Subsequent studies revealed that the transcription factor GATA3, but not ERG, a known regulator of vWF transcription in vascular cells, mediated the vWF elevation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays validated that GATA3 binds directly to the +220 GATA binding motif on the human vWF promoter and A549 conditioned media significantly increases the binding of GATA3. Taken together, we demonstrate that vWF expression in ECs of LAC is elevated by the cancer cell-derived secretome through enhanced GATA3-mediated transcription.
