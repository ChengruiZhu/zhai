The meiotic cell cycle enables sexually reproducing organisms to generate reproductive cells with half their chromosome complement. Chromosome ploidy is reduced during meiosis by virtue of prior associations established between homologous chromosomes (homologs). Such associations, which are ultimately secured by crossover recombination events, allow homologs to achieve an opposing orientation and segregate from one another at meiosis I. A multimeric protein structure, the synaptonemal complex (SC), mediates the intimate, lengthwise alignment of homologs during meiotic prophase and forms the context in which crossovers mature. The SC's tripartite structure is widely conserved but its composition and architecture remain incompletely understood in any organism. The Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier (SUMO) localizes to SC in budding yeast. We show that SUMO is required for assembling mature SC and we furthermore demonstrate that SUMO and the recently identified SUMOylated protein, Ecm11, are components of the central element substructure of the budding yeast SC. Our findings suggest that SUMO and Ecm11 are core building blocks of SC, yet our data also suggest that SUMOylation may occur subsequent to Ecm11's incorporation into the SC structure. Finally, our study highlights Structured Illumination as a powerful tool for mapping the fine structure of budding yeast SC.
