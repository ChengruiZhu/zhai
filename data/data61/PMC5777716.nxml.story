Cancer cells exhibit an abnormal amino acid metabolism and a dependence on specific amino acids, which might provide potential targets for treating cancer patients. In this study, we demonstrated that human triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells were highly susceptible to cystine starvation. We found that necrostatin-1 (Nec-1, a RIP1 inhibitor), necrosulfonamide (an MLKL inhibitor), deferoxamine (an ion chelator), ferrostatin-1 (a ferroptosis inhibitor) and RIP1 knockdown can prevent cystine-starvation-induced cell death, suggesting that cystine starvation induces necroptosis and ferroptosis in TNBC cells. Moreover, cystine starvation induced mitochondrial fragmentation, dysfunction, and ROS production. A mitochondrial ROS scavenger, Necrox-5, can prevent cystine-starvation-induced cell death. In addition, cystine starvation was found to activate GCN2, but not PERK, to increase the phosphorylation of eIF2α at serine 51, the protein expression of ATF4, and the expression of ATF4 target genes such as CHAC1, which might be downstream of the RIP1/RIP3-MLKL pathway and contribute to cystine-starvation-induced cell death. Knockdown of CHAC1 rescued the cystine-starvation-induced reduction in glutathione (GSH) levels and cell death. Furthermore, N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), Trolox, and Nec-1 significantly prevented the cystine-starvation-induced increase in intracellular ROS levels, mitochondrial fragmentation and cell death. In summary, these results suggest that CHAC1 degradation of GSH enhances cystine-starvation-induced necroptosis and ferroptosis through the activated GCN2-eIF2α-ATF4 pathway in TNBC cells. Our findings improve our understanding of the mechanism underlying cystine-starvation-induced TNBC cell death.
