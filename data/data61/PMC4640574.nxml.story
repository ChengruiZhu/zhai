The researchers used data from the MEGA study, a study of risk factors for VTE, to build a prediction model for a first VTE in patients with a leg cast; the prediction model included 32 predictors (the full model). They also built a restricted model, which included only 11 predictors but had maximum predictive value, and a clinical model, which included 14 environmental predictors that can all be determined without drawing blood or undertaking any assays. They then determined the ability of each model to distinguish between patients with a leg cast who did and did not develop VTE using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The area under the curve (AUC) for the full model was 0.85, for the restricted model it was 0.85, and for the clinical model it was 0.77. (A predictive test that discriminates perfectly between individuals who do and do not subsequently develop a specific condition has an AUC of 1.00; a test that is no better at predicting outcomes than flipping a coin has an AUC of 0.5.) Similar or higher AUCs were obtained for all the models using data collected in two independent studies. Finally, the researchers converted the clinical model into a risk score by giving each variable in the model a numerical score. The sum of these scores was used to stratify individuals into categories of low or high risk for VTE. With a cutoff of 9 points, the risk score correctly identified 80.8% of the patients in the MEGA study with a plaster cast who developed VTE and 60.8% of the patients who did not develop VTE.
