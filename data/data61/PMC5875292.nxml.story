The treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) can be challenging, especially in elderly multimorbid patients. Since incidence and prevalence rates of IBD are rising steadily, treatment of older patients with relevant and also rare comorbidities will be of increasing relevancy for caregivers. Here we report on a 74-year-old multimorbid patient with severe ulcerative colitis (UC) and hemophilia A. Because of the chronic active disease, therapy with a tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitor was started. He suffered from a severe infectious complication (pneumonia) under therapy with infliximab. The therapy was changed to vedolizumab, with which the patient stayed in long-term clinical and endoscopic remission. Because the patient had a non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in April 2016, he received dual platelet inhibitor therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. Because of consecutive aspirin intolerance, the therapy was changed to clopidogrel monotherapy. Although the UC was treated appropriately with vedolizumab and the patient was in endoscopic mucosal remission, recurrent bleeding episodes from multiple inflammatory pseudopolyps occurred. The bleeding episodes resolved quickly after immediate treatment with factor VIII (Kogenate®). In conclusion, we describe the first patient in the literature with UC and hemophilia A who stayed in long-term remission under therapy with vedolizumab. From our point of view, vedolizumab can be safely administered in the setting of UC and hemophilia A. Antiplatelet drugs which inhibit primary hemostasis must be used with caution in this setting. Bleeding episodes can be treated safely and effectively with factor VIII (Kogenate®).
