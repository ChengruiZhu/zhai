The activities of some key enzymes in mitochondria from 135 human omental adipose tissue samples of obese and nonobese patients were analyzed for potential association with the patients' state of obesity. The activities of respiratory complexes I and II as well as citrate synthase in isolated mitochondria were measured using spectrophotometric enzyme assays. ATP generation of mitochondria was determined with a bioluminescence assay. Protein levels of citrate synthase were quantified by western blot. The rates of ATP generation and the enzymatic activities of complexes I and II did not display associations with age, gender, obesity, or diabetes. By contrast, the enzymatic activities of citrate synthase and its protein levels were significantly reduced in obesity as compared to controls. In diabetic patients, protein levels but not enzymatic activities of citrate synthase were elevated. Thus, this investigation based on enzymatic assay and determination of protein levels revealed that the development of obesity is associated with a significant impact on citrate synthase in mitochondria of human omental adipose tissue. The state of obesity appears to affect mitochondrial function in human omental adipose tissue by limiting this key enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle rather than by limiting the activities of respiratory chain enzymes.
