A 28-year-old presented with complaints of severe pain and redness in the left eye since 2 weeks. He had similar complaints in the right eye 2 years back for which he had undergone a scleral patch graft. Best corrected visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes. The right had a well vascularized scleral graft and rest of the anterior segment was normal. The left eye had inferior conjunctival congestion with an area of the scleral melt with uveal show just temporal to the limbus in the interpalbebral area. The cornea was clear and anterior chamber was quiet in the left eye. Applanation tonometry and fundus evaluation were normal in both eyes. Physical examination revealed hyperpigmented skin lesion, hypertrichosis and absorption of distal phalanges. Laboratory, ocular and physical findings confirmed the diagnosis of congenital erythropoietic porphyria. He was on oral steroids 40 mg/day since 2 weeks and topical antibiotics and lubricants. He was advised to continue the same and was taken up for scleral patch graft with fibrin glue in the left eye. Postoperatively he was continued on topical and oral steroids and lubricants.3 weeks later the left eye had stabilized however patient came with a melt in the right eye. Since it was an early melt, we went ahead with cyanoacrylate glue and bandage contact lens in the right eye and started him on topical steroids for the right eye also. Three months later both the eyes were stable, and the patient was gradually tapered off the steroids.
