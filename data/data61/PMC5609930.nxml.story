Gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) is a precancerous gastric carcinoma (GC) lesion with pivotal roles in carcinogenesis. CD24, LGR5 and Ki67 are expressed in GIM; we previously demonstrated that aquaporin 3 (AQP3) is expressed in goblet cells and is positively correlated with GIM severity. However, the relationships of AQP3 with GIM classification and with other proteins, and their roles in the transition from GIM to gastric carcinoma (GC) remain unknown. Sixteen patients with intestinal-type GC were enrolled in this study. GIM was determined according to the updated Sydney system; GIM classification was determined via HID-AB staining, and AQP3, CD24, LGR5 and Ki67 expression were determined by immunohistochemistry. Type III GIM was more prevalent around the GC and displayed a positive association with GIM severity. CD24 was found in GIM, but LGR5 and Ki67 were found in tissues regardless of GIM. AQP3 expression showed significant correlation to type III GIM. CD24 expression was correlated with the marked GIM and incomplete GIM, while LGR5 expression decreased with GIM aggravation and did not have relationship with classification of GIM. However, Ki67 presented no association with GIM grade or classification. These observations identify AQP3 and CD24 as biomarkers for carcinogenesis of GIM, and may provide a precise strategy for screening at-risk candidates with GIM.
