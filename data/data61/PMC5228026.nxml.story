The purpose of this study was to analyze the safety and effectiveness of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in early stage renal cell carcinoma. A total of 76 patients suffering from early stage renal cell carcinoma were selected and randomly assigned into the observation group (41 cases) or the control group (35 cases). Percutaneous RFA was used in the observation group, while retroperitoneoscopic radical operation of renal cell carcinoma was used in the control group, and the operative effects were compared. In the observation group, operation time, blood loss during operation, length of stay and incidence rate of complications were lower than those in control group (P<0.05). For both groups, serum C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 and T lymphocyte counts at 1, 2 and 3 days after operation were all increased; however, the control group had significantly greater increase for all the time points (P<0.05). For total effective rates, tumour-free survival times and survival rates, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups (P>0.05). Percutaneous RFA has a reduced size of operation wound and a quick postoperative recovery time in the treatment of early stage renal cell carcinoma. It results in less inflammation and immunity-based injuries in the body and achieves the same clinical outcomes as retroperitoneoscopic radical operation of renal cell carcinoma.
