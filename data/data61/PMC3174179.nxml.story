In the United States, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common form of cancer among children. Although the survival rate of childhood leukemia is relatively high, those who do not respond to chemotherapy have very low prognostic outcome. Recent reports point to the critical role of metabolism in determining cell sensitivity to doxorubicin, a conventional drug used in leukemia treatment. Most of the molecular components involved in doxorubicin metabolism have been identified; however, how these components operate as a system and how adaptation of the doxorubicin metabolic network to patient-specific changes in protein components is much less understood. We have therefore chosen to investigate via computational modeling the variations in the distribution of proteins that metabolize doxorubicin can control a cell's ability to respond to doxorubicin treatment. This systems-level approach provides a framework for understanding how patient-specific variability leads to patient-sensitivity to doxorubicin treatment at different doses. With this knowledge, we were able to correctly predict complex behavior induced by pharmacological intervention strategies for manipulation of doxorubicin metabolism. When our interventions are used in combination with doxorubicin, cell viability was promoted or potentiated based on dominant control mechanisms within the metabolic network.
