Genome-wide RNA interference assays of gene functions offer the potential for systematic, global analysis of biological processes. A pressing challenge is to develop meta-analysis methods that effectively combine information from multiple studies. One puzzle is that implicated gene lists from independent studies of the same process often show relatively low overlap. This disagreement might arise from false-positive factors, such as imperfect gene targeting (off-target effects), or from false negatives if separate studies access different components of large, complex systems. We present new methods to examine the relations between individual genome-wide RNAi studies, using studies of host genes in influenza virus replication as a test case. We find that cross-study agreement is greater than suggested by overlap of reported gene lists. This better agreement is evidenced by the strong relation of independent gene lists in functional pathways and protein interaction networks, and by a statistical model that relates multi-study, gene-level findings to factors driving correct, false-negative, and false-positive gene identification. Our analysis of multiple genome-wide studies predicts that there are many undetected host genes important for influenza virus infection, and that false negatives are the major concerns for genome-wide studies.
