We introduce and evaluate a new biologically-motivated learning rule for neural networks. The proposed mechanism explains why it is easier to acquire knowledge when it relates to known background information than when it is completely novel. We posit that this “background information-gated” (BIG) learning emerges from the necessity of neuronal axons and dendrites to be adjacent to each other in order to establish new synapses. Such basic geometric requirement, which was explicitly recognized in Donald Hebb’s original formulation of synaptic plasticity, is not usually accounted for in neural network learning rules. More generally, the level of abstraction of current computational models is insufficient to capture the details of axonal and dendritic shape. Here we show that “axonal-dendritic overlap” (ADO) can be parsimoniously related to connectivity by assuming optimal neuronal placement to minimize axonal wiring. Incorporating this new relationship into classic connectionist learning algorithms, we show that networks trained in a given domain more easily acquire further knowledge in the same domain than in others. Surprisingly, the morphologically-motivated constraint on structural plasticity also endows neural nets with the powerful computational ability to discriminate real associations of events, like the sight of a lightning and the sound of the thunder, from spurious co-occurrences, such as between the thunder and the beetle that flew by during the storm. Thus, the selectivity of synaptic formation implied by the ADO requirement is shown to provide a fundamental cognitive advantage over classic artificial neural networks.
