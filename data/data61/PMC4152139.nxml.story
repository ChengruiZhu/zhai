Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is an important fibrogenic and immunomodulatory cytokine participating in the pathogenesis of a number of illnesses related to the growth, differentiation and migration of cells. It also plays a key role in inflammation, atherosclerosis, vascular inflammation and asthma. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between the expression of the TGF-β1 gene and its genetic polymorphisms, and the disease phenotype. The study comprised 173 patients with asthma, as well as 163 healthy volunteers as a control group. The gender profiles of the groups were similar (p=0.8415). Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-high resolution melting (HRM). The results were verified by sequencing. Gene expression was evaluated by RT-PCR. This study evaluated the role and frequency of genetic polymorphisms (C−509T, C+466T and T+869C) of the TGF-β1 gene in the study group (patients with asthma) and the control group (healthy volunteers). The results obtained for the patients and healthy controls were as follows: C−509T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (controls, TT/CT/CC-0.4444/0.5309/0.0247; patients, TT/CT/CC-0.3699/0.6012/0.0289), C+466T SNP (controls, TT/CT/CC-1.000/0.000/0.000; patients, TT/CT/CC-1.000/0.000/0.000) and T+869C SNP (controls, TT/CT/CC-1.000/0.000/0.000; patients, TT/CT/CC-1.000/0.000/0.000). Only the C−509T polymorphism was found to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of asthma, as well as a risk factor in the loss of the clinical control of the disease [TT vs. CC/CT, odds ratio (OR) 2.38; confidence interval (CI) 1.22–4.66; p=0.0103]. A significant difference was noted between the study and control groups with regard to the mRNA expression of TGF-β1 (p=0.0133). A higher level of expression of the TGF-β1 gene correlated with the time of diagnosis of patients over 16 years of age (p=0.0255). This study demonstrates that the C−509T SNP is a significant clinical risk factor for asthma and that the TGF-β1 cytokine contributes to the progression of the illness.
