Next-generation sequencing technologies have allowed genetic association studies of complex traits at the single base-pair resolution, where most genetic variants have extremely low mutation frequencies. These rare variants have been the focus of modern statistical-computational genomics due to their potential to explain missing disease heritability. The identification of individual rare variants associated with diseases can provide new biological insights and enable the precise delineation of disease mechanisms. However, due to the extreme rarity of mutations and large numbers of variants, significances of causative variants tend to be mixed inseparably with a few noncausative ones, and standard multiple testing procedures controlling for false positives fail to provide a meaningful way to include a large proportion of the causative variants. To address the challenge of detecting weak biological signals, we propose a novel statistical procedure, based on false-negative control, to provide a practical approach for variant inclusion in large-scale sequencing studies. By determining those variants that can be confidently dispatched as noncausative, the proposed procedure offers an objective selection of a modest number of potentially causative variants at the single-locus level. Results can be further prioritized or used to infer disease-associated genes with annotation information.
