Several members of the Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family are essential regulators of genome integrity, actively prospected as drug targets for cancer therapy. Among them, PARP3 is well characterized for its functions in double-strand break repair and mitotis. Here we report that PARP3 also plays an integral role in TGFβ and reactive oxygen species (ROS) dependent epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stem-like cell properties in human mammary epithelial and breast cancer cells. PARP3 expression is higher in breast cancer cells of the mesenchymal phenotype and correlates with the expression of the mesenchymal marker Vimentin while being in inverse correlation with the epithelial marker E-cadherin. Furthermore, PARP3 expression is significantly upregulated during TGFβ-induced EMT in various human epithelial cells. In line with this observation, PARP3 depletion alters TGFβ-dependent EMT of mammary epithelial cells by preventing the induction of the Snail-E-cadherin axis, the dissolution of cell junctions, the acquisition of cell motility and chemoresistance. PARP3 responds to TGFβ-induced ROS to promote a TG2-Snail-E-cadherin axis during EMT. Considering the link between EMT and cancer stem cells, we show that PARP3 promotes stem-like cell properties in mammary epithelial and breast cancer cells by inducing the expression of the stem cell markers SOX2 and OCT4, by increasing the proportion of tumor initiating CD44
