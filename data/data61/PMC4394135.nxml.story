MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to regulate the development of chemoresistance in many tumors. Stathmin 1 (STMN1) is a microtubule-depolymerizing molecule, involved in chemo-response; however, the mechanism of its regulation is unknown. Herein, the immunohistochemical study indicated significant upregulation of the STMN1 in the ovarian cancer tissues defined as resistant tumors compared with those defined as responsive tumors. STMN1 level elevated in the chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells, KF-TX, compared with the parental, KF, ones. Targeting STMN1 by siRNA restored taxane-sensitivity of KF-TX cells. Screening miRNA profiles from KF/KF-TX cellular set followed by bioinformatics-based prediction, revealed that miR-31 could be a possible regulator of STMN1. Down-modulation of miR-31 was verified by quantitative RT-PCR in the cellular set used. Overexpression of miR-31 in KF-TX cells (KF-TX-miR-31) significantly restored chemo-response and reduced STMN1 expression as well. STMN1 reduction-associated cellular characteristics such as enhanced microtubule polymerization and stability, as indicated by acetylated tubulin quantification, confocal visualization, and G2 phase delay, were observed in KF-TX-miR-31 cells, indicating the functional reduction of STMN1. miR-31 suppressed the luciferase activity in reporter construct containing the STMN1 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR), confirming that miR-31 directly targets STMN1. miR-31 has therapeutic potency when introduced into ovarian cancer, in combination with taxane.
