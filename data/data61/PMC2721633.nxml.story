Kashin-Beck disease (KBD) is a severe, chronic, and deforming musculoskeletal disease affecting millions of individuals in specific regions of Asia. Starting in childhood, the disorder leads to joint and limb deformities, short stature, and delayed skeletal development. Articular cartilage damage due to chondronecrosis and limb deformities then lead to secondary osteoarthritis and severe disability. Factors proposed to cause KBD include selenium deficiency, iodine deficiency, contamination of grain with toxic molds, and humic substances in well water. Soil and water deficiency in selenium (and iodine) are a consistent feature of KBD endemic areas, and affected individuals show profound deficiencies of these two elements. Thus far, there have been no convincing rodent models of KBD based on selenium (and/or iodine) deficiency achieved through dietary manipulation. Our manuscript describes a conditional gene mutation approach in mice that, in effect, mimics severe selenium deficiency, achieving this specifically within skeletal progenitor cells. By deleting selenocysteine tRNA (required for normal selenoprotein activity) in osteo-chondroprogenitors, we found that mice develop post-natal impairment of skeletal growth, dwarfism, delayed ossification, impaired endochondral bone formation, as well as severe chondronecrosis. Our mutant mouse supports the idea that selenium deficiency is key to the skeletal pathology of KBD.
