Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm (GEP-NEN) is known to overexpress somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), most commonly SSTR2 and SSTR5. The expression of SSTRs on tumor cells forms the basis for somatostatin analog treatment of patients with NEN. The present study detected the expression of SSTR2 and SSTR5 in GEP-NEN and investigated the efficacy and safety of octreotide long-acting release (LAR) in the treatment of advanced gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NET) in China. The present study reported that functionality of the pancreas, G1 and G2 grading, NET classification and Tumor-Node-Metastasis stages I and II were associated with higher SSTR2 positive expression. Similarly, SSTR5 was increased in pancreatic and well-differentiated tumors. SSTR2 and SSTR5 positive expression predicted improved survival in GEP-NEN patients. The median overall survival of patients treated with octreotide LAR was not reached. The median time to progression was 20.2 months, with the objective response rate being 5.6% and the stable disease rate being 79.6%. A total of 25.9% of the patients experienced adverse drug reactions. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that SSTR2 and SSTR5 are heterogeneously expressed in GEP-NEN. Both markers may serve as potential prognostic factors. Octreotide LAR is effective and safe in the treatment of Chinese patients with advanced GEP-NET.
