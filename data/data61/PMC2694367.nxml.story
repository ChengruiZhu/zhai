A complete description of complex polymers, such as proteins, includes information about their structure and their dynamics. In particular it is of utmost importance to answer the following questions: What are the structural conformations possible? Is there any relevant hierarchy among these conformers? What are the transition paths between them? These and other questions can be addressed by analyzing in an efficient way the Free Energy Landscape of the system. With this knowledge, several problems about biomolecular reactions (such as enzymatic activity, protein folding, protein deposition diseases, etc.) can be tackled. In this article we show how to efficiently describe the Free Energy Landscape for small and large peptides. By mapping the trajectories of molecular dynamics simulations into a graph (the Conformational Markov Network) and unveiling its structural organization, we obtain a coarse grained description of the protein dynamics across the Free Energy Landscape in terms of the relevant kinetic magnitudes of the system. Therefore, we show the way to bridge the gap between the microscopic dynamics and the macroscopic kinetics by means of a mesoscopic description of the associated Conformational Markov Network. Along this path the compromise between the physical nature of the process and the magnitudes that characterize the network is carefully kept to assure the reliability of the results shown.
