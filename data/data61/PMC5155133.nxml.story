We observed structural changes in the follicles and uterus of heavy draft mares during estrus and examined the effect of a single injection of the
gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog buserelin on ovulation and endocrine profiles. Twenty-two heavy draft mares were divided into a buserelin-treated group
(n=8) and a control group (n=14). Mares were given an intramuscular injection of 40 µg buserelin when they presented signs of estrus to a teaser stallion, had
≥45 mm diameter follicles, and presented decreased uterine edema compared with the previous examination. The follicles and uterus were monitored using
transrectal ultrasound imaging and measurement of blood levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), progesterone, and estradiol-17β.
The ovulation rates within 48 hr was significantly higher in the treated group (100%, 8/8) than in the control group (57.1%, 8/14; P=0.051). The mean ± SEM time
before confirmation of ovulation was 29 ± 9 hr for the treated group and 59 ± 7 hr for the control group. There were no significant differences in mating
frequency, double ovulation rate, or fertility rate between the two groups. One to two days after administering buserelin, LH and FSH temporarily increased, and
in the control group, LH was high during ovulation, whereas FSH temporarily increased with the growth of the follicle. These results indicate that a single
injection of 40 µg buserelin when follicles are at least 45 mm in diameter and uterine edema is decreased is effective for inducing ovulation.
