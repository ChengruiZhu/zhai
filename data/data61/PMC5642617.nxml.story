Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) production via cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenases closely correlates with the progression of breast cancer. However, its role in the development of chemoresistant breast cancers has yet to be elucidated. Here, we found that CYP3A4 expression and its epoxy-product, 11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (11,12-EET) was enhanced in tamoxifen (TAM)-resistant MCF-7 (TAMR-MCF-7) breast cancer cells compared to control MCF-7 cells. Treatment of TAMR-MCF-7 cells with ketoconazole and azamulin (selective CYP3A4 inhibitors) or 14,15-epoxyeicosa-5(Z)-enoic acid (14,15-EEZE, an EET antagonist) inhibited cellular proliferation and recovered the sensitivity to 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Chick chorioallantoic membrane and trans-well migration analyses revealed that the enhanced angiogenic, tumorigenic, and migration intensities of TAMR-MCF-7 cells were also significantly suppressed by ketoconazole and 14,15-EEZE. We previously reported that Pin1, a peptidyl prolyl isomerase, is a crucial regulator for higher angiogenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition characteristics of TAMR-MCF-7 cells. EET inhibition suppressed E2F1-dependent Pin1 gene transcription, and Pin1 silencing also blocked cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and migration of TAMR-MCF-7 cells. Our findings suggest that the CYP3A4-mediated EET pathway represents a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer.
