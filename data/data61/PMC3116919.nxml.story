An enhanceosome is a functional unit that consists of DNA segment called enhancer; its transcription factors (TFs); and their interacting cofactors. To function, the TFs must assemble on their corresponding response elements (REs) cooperatively. Understanding how TFs assemble is important because the TF combination on the enhancer spells gene-specific activation (or repression). Traditional studies focused mainly on the derivation of consensus DNA sequences, and the TF interaction with its respective RE. This yielded limited success in deciphering the mechanism of selective TF binding. Here, in addition to the conventional roles of protein and DNA, we studied the organization of REs. The IFN-Î² enhanceosome is a good example because there are limited protein-protein interactions between consecutive TFs. Our molecular dynamics simulations revealed that cooperativity is achieved via overlap of REs, in addition to sparse protein-protein interactions. That is, because the REs overlap, binding of neighboring TFs affect each other through DNA conformation perturbation. In addition, alternation of consensus and non-consensus REs along the enhancer allows more efficient binding of TFs, while the order of the REs excludes unwanted TFs, and enhances selective TF binding. Our findings emphasize the overlooked role of the order and organization of REs, and the length of spacers between consecutive REs.
