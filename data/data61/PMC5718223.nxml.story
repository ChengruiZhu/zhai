One‐hundred‐and‐twenty‐eight–section dual X‐ray source computed tomography (CT) systems have been introduced into clinical practice and have been shown to increase temporal resolution. Higher temporal resolution allows low‐dose spiral mode at a high pitch factor during CT coronary angiography. We evaluated radiation dose and physical image qualities in CT coronary angiography by applying high‐pitch spiral, step‐and‐shoot, and low‐pitch spiral modes to determine the optimal acquisition mode for clinical situations. An anthropomorphic phantom, small dosimeters, a calibration phantom, and a microdisc phantom were used to evaluate the radiation doses absorbed by thoracic organs, noise power spectrums, in‐plane and z‐axis modulation transfer functions, slice sensitivity profiles, and number of artifacts for the three acquisition modes. The high‐pitch spiral mode had the advantage of a small absorbed radiation dose, but provided low image quality. The low‐pitch spiral mode resulted in a high absorbed radiation dose of approximately 200 mGy for the heart. Although the absorbed radiation dose was lower in the step‐and‐shoot mode than in the low‐pitch spiral mode, the noise power spectrum was inferior. The quality of the in‐plane modulation transfer function differed, depending on spatial frequency. Therefore, the step‐and‐shoot mode should be applied initially because of its low absorbed radiation dose and superior image quality.
