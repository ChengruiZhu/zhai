Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVR) has emerged as an alternative, rapidly evolving treatment option for patients with severe aortic stenosis and high surgical risk. Stroke is a devastating complication being confined mainly in the periprocedural and 30-day period following TAVR, with a lower and relatively constant frequency thereafter. Early stroke is mainly due to debris embolization during the procedure, whereas later events are associated with patient specific factors. Despite the fact that the rate of clinical stroke has been constantly decreasing compared to initial TAVR experience, modern neuro-imaging with MRI suggests that new ischemic lesions post-TAVR are almost universal. The impact of the latter is largely unknown. However, they seem to correlate with a reduction in neurocognitive function. Because TAVR is set to expand its indication to lower surgical-risk patients, stroke prophylaxis during and after TAVR becomes of paramount importance. Based on clinical and pathophysiological evidence, three lines of research are actively employed towards this direction: improvement in valve and delivery system technology with an aim to reduce manipulations and contact with the calcified aortic arch and native valve, antithrombotic therapy, and embolic protection devices. Careful patient selection, design of the procedure, and tailored antithrombotic strategies respecting the bleeding risks of this fragile population constitute the main defense against stroke following TAVR.
