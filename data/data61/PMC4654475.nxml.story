Animal genomes from flies to humans contain many hundreds of non-coding elements called Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) cluster loci (piC loci). Some of these elements generate piRNAs that direct the silencing of transposable elements, which are pervasive genetic parasites. However, we lack an understanding of the targeting function for the remaining bulk of piRNAs because their loci are not complementarity to transposable elements. In addition, the field does not know if all piC loci are quickly evolving, or if some piC loci might be deeply conserved in piRNA expression, an indication of its potentially functional importance. Our study confirms the highly rapid evolution in piRNA expression capacity for the majority of piC loci in flies and mammals, with many clade- and species-specific piC loci expression patterns. In spite of this, we also discover a cohort of piC loci that are deeply conserved in piRNA expression from the human to the dog, a significantly broad phylogenetic spectrum of eutherian mammals. However, this conservation in piRNA expression ends at non-eutherian mammals like marsupials and monotremes. Existing mutations in two of these Eutherian-Conserved piC (ECpiC) loci impair mouse reproduction and abrogate piRNA production. Therefore, we suggest these ECpiC loci are conserved for piRNA expression due to their important function in eutherian reproduction and stand out as prime candidates for future genetic studies.
