water-soluble, water-insoluble and swellable, and water insoluble and non-swellable). Tablets were prepared by direct compression, and their swelling and erosion in presence of these different excipients were assessed with the help of volumetric, gravimetric, morphological, and rheological studies. Dissolution test was performed using USP 26 apparatus 2 modified by insertion of a sieve to prevent sticking of the tablets to the bottom of the vessel and allow them to swell 3-dimensionally. Loading 15% of the highly soluble drug in formulations containing 65% lactose showed the most pronounced swelling and erosion and the best sustained drug release, compared to matrices containing microcrystalline cellulose and dicalcium phosphate. The correlation between front movement, mass erosion and solute transport in relation to excipient type on progression of probe displacement and total work was examined throughout texture analysis studies. The formulation containing the soluble excipient lactose showed better swelling and erosion properties compared to formulations containing the swellable and insoluble excipients. In conclusion, it could be said that based on the distinct conventional dosage forms insertion of particular excipients in hydrophilic controlled release tablets containing water soluble drug, the finger print information of drug release profile could be obtained. To study the release profile from hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose K 15M matrices with different types of excpients, diltiazem hydrochloride was used as a model soluble drug.
