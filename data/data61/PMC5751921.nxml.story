To address the complexity of the X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) process, we previously developed a unified approach for the association test for X-chromosomal single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the disease of interest, accounting for different biological possibilities of XCI: random, skewed, and escaping XCI. In the original study, we focused on the SNP-disease association test but did not provide knowledge regarding the underlying XCI models. One can use the highest likelihood ratio (LLR) to select XCI models (max-LLR approach). However, that approach does not formally compare the LLRs corresponding to different XCI models to assess whether the models are distinguishable. Therefore, we propose an LLR comparison procedure (comp-LLR approach), inspired by the Cox test, to formally compare the LLRs of different XCI models to select the most likely XCI model that describes the underlying XCI process. We conduct simulation studies to investigate the max-LLR and comp-LLR approaches. The simulation results show that compared with the max-LLR, the comp-LLR approach has higher probability of identifying the correct underlying XCI model for the scenarios when the underlying XCI process is random XCI, escaping XCI, or skewed XCI to the deleterious allele. We applied both approaches to a head and neck cancer genetic study to investigate the underlying XCI processes for the X-chromosomal genetic variants.
