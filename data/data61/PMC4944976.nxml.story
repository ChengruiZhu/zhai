Merkel cells are innervated touch-receptor cells that are responsible for light touch sensations. They originate from embryonic epidermal stem cells and, in hairy regions of skin, are organized in touch domes. Touch domes are highly patterned structures that form exclusively around primary hair follicles. Strikingly, the mechanisms controlling Merkel cell formation are largely unknown. Here, we show that the hair follicle functions as a niche required for Merkel cell formation. We find that intraepidermal Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling, initiated by the production of Shh in the developing hair follicles, is required for Merkel cell specification, whereas Shh overexpression in embryonic epidermal progenitors leads to ectopic Merkel cells. Interestingly, Shh signaling is common to all hair types, suggesting that there are restrictive mechanisms that allow Merkel cell specification to occur exclusively around primary hairs. Indeed, we find that loss of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in the epidermis leads to the formation of ectopic Merkel cells around all hair types. We show that PRC2 loss expands the field of epidermal cells competent to differentiate into Merkel cells through derepression of key Merkel-differentiation genes; however, inductive Shh signaling is still required for the formation of mature Merkel cells. Our study illustrates how the interplay between epigenetic and morphogen cues functions to establish the complex patterning and formation of the mammalian skin.
