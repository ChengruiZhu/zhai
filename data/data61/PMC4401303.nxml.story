Molecular imprinting is a technique for the synthesis of polymers capable to bind target molecules selectively. The imprinting of large proteins, such as cell adhesion proteins or cell receptors, opens the way to important and innovative biomedical applications. However, such molecules can incur into important conformational changes during the preparation of the imprinted polymer impairing the specificity of the recognition cavities. The “epitope approach” can overcome this limit by adopting, as template, a short peptide sequence representative of an accessible fragment of a larger protein. The resulting imprinted polymer can recognize both the template and the whole molecule thanks to the specific cavities for the epitope. In this work two molecularly imprinted polymer formulations (a macroporous monolith and nanospheres) were obtained using the protected peptide Z-Thr-Ala-Ala-OMe, as template, and Z-Thr-Ile-Leu-OMe, as analogue for the selectivity evaluation, methacrylic acid, as functional monomer, and trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate and pentaerythritol triacrylate (PETRA), as cross-linkers. Polymers were synthesized by precipitation polymerization and characterized by standard techniques. Polymerization and rebinding solutions were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. The highly cross-linked polymers retained about 70% of the total template amount, against (20% for the less cross-linked ones). The extracted template amount and the rebinding capacity decreased with the cross-linking degree, while the selectivity showed the opposite behaviour. The PETRA cross-linked polymers showed the best recognition (MIP 2
