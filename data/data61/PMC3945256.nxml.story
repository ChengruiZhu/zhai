Dento-alveolar disharmony (DAD) with crowding represents a predispose factor for periodontal pathology installing, especially when septic inflammation is associated. In this context, the identification of integrity or presence of the periodontal structure modifications becomes essential, any discovered element of periodontal pathology transforming into an important factor for a correct and beneficial orthodontic or periodontal-orthodontic therapy setup. The purpose of our study was to reveal the relations between the DAD existence and periodontal modifications within a lot of 528 subjects of 7 to 19 years old wearing different DAD who asked for an orthodontic control, and also the effects of orthodontic therapy upon periodontal structures for the situations in which this therapy was instituted. 74,87% was the percentage for patients with DAD and crowding who accepted the initiation of an orthodontic treatment and 12,75% of them had a friable C type periodontium (with great possibility to evolve towards a periodontal pathology), 25,62% had chronic gingivitis, and in 15,43% there have been noticed gingival recessions more than 2 mm. The orthodontic treatment was finalized for 44,96% of the patients, in 13,43% we noticed the persistence of C type periodontium, in 8,95% of gingival recessions more than 2 mm, in 25,37% chronic gingivitis and in 22,38% hypertrophic gingivitis. Conclusion: it is important to initiate an exhaustive control of the patient with DAD before, during and after the orthodontic treatment, especially if the patient is susceptible to develop a periodontal pathology, and also to maintain a good oral hygiene along the treatment.
