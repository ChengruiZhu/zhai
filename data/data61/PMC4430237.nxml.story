Movements of left and right limbs in mammals during locomotion are controlled by distinct rhythm-generating neuronal circuits in the spinal cord. Complex interactions between these circuits provide flexible coordination of limb movements in different gaits. It was shown that interactions between left and right spinal circuits are mediated by commissural interneurons. Genetic ablation of a particular type of these interneurons, called V0, leads to switching from a regular, left-right alternating “walking” activity to a left-right synchronous “hopping” pattern. Moreover, the V0 commissural interneurons have excitatory and inhibitory subtypes that appear to play different roles in the left-right coordination depending on locomotor speed. In this theoretical study, we build a simplified mathematical model of spinal circuits that describes left and right rhythm generators interacting bilaterally via several types of commissural connections. Using this model, we simulate different experimental manipulations, analyze the resultant alternating and synchronous regimes of activity, and propose explanations for the results of experimental studies. We show that although both excitatory and inhibitory V0 commissural pathways support left-right alternation, the resultant locomotor pattern and gait depend on the balance between different commissural interactions, which in turn may depend on the level of neuronal excitation and locomotor speed.
