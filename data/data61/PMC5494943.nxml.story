The present study aimed to investigate the clinicopathological significance of programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) expression in extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC). PD-L1 and PD-1 expression was detected by immunohistochemical methods in 70 ECC formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens and 50 para-carcinoma tissue specimens. The associations of PD-L1 and PD-1 expression with clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of ECC patients were explored. Positive rates of PD-L1 and PD-1 expression were increased in ECC tissues compared with those in the corresponding para-carcinoma tissues. Besides, the expression of PD-L1 was correlated with the expression of PD-1 (P<0.05). Statistical analysis revealed that the expression of PD-L1 and PD-1 in ECC tissues exhibited no correlation with patient age, sex or histological grade, but was significantly correlated with tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage and lymphatic metastasis. Univariate analysis demonstrated that PD-L1 expression, PD-1 expression, TNM stage and lymphatic metastasis were significantly associated with the survival time of patients. Further multivariate analysis revealed the PD-L1 expression was an independent prognostic factor of patients with ECC. These preliminary results suggested that PD-L1 or PD-1 immunodetection may be a valuable prognostic marker for ECC patients, and that PD-L1 immunodetection may be used as an independent factor to evaluate the prognosis of ECC patients.
