Squamous Cell Carcinoma Antigen (SCCA) is consistently overexpressed in many different solid tumors, and has been associated with both tumor aggressiveness and chemoresistance. No data, however, is currently available on SCCA expression during esophageal Barrett's carcinogenesis, nor on SCCA expression's role on esophageal adenocarcinoma chemoresistance. The SCCA immunohistochemical expression was assessed in a series of 100 biopsy samples covering the whole histological spectrum of Barrett's oncogenesis. Squamous native mucosa was characterized by a moderate to strong cytoplasmic and nuclear SCCA expression in suprabasal, medium, and superficial layers. On the other hand, almost half of the considered lesions did not express SCCA; the other half featured weak to moderate SCCA expression. The relationship between SCCA protein expression and tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was assessed in 90 esophageal adenocarcinoma specimens (40 biopsy and 50 surgery specimens), stratified according to Mandard tumor regression grade. As observed in other settings, the presence of SCCA expression clustered in the group of tumors characterized by a lower responsiveness to neoadjuvant treatments. The present results suggest an involvement of SCCA in a subset of Barrett-related tumors, and prompt to consider the SCCA-protein expression as response-predictive marker of neoadjuvant therapy in esophageal adenocarcinomas.
