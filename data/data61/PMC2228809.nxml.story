The activation of contraction in vertebrate skeletal muscle involves the binding of Ca2+ to low-affinity binding sites on the troponin C (TnC) subunit of the regulatory protein troponin. The present study is an investigation of possible cooperative interactions between adjacent functional groups, composed of seven actin monomers, one tropomyosin, and one troponin, along the same thin filament. Single skinned fibers were obtained from rabbit psoas muscles and were then placed in an experimental chamber containing relaxing solution maintained at 15 degrees C. Isometric tension was measured in solutions containing maximally and submaximally activating levels of free Ca2+ (a) in control fiber segments, (b) in the same segments after partial extraction of TnC, and finally (c) after recombination of TnC into the segments. The extraction was done at 11-13 degrees C in 20 mM Tris, 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.85 or 8.3, a procedure derived from that of Cox et al. (1981. Biochem. J. 195:205). Extraction of TnC was quantitated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the control and experimental samples. Partial extraction of TnC resulted in reductions in tension during maximal Ca activation and in a shift of the relative tension-pCa (i.e., -log[Ca2+]) relationship to lower pCa's. The readdition of TnC to the extracted fiber segments resulted in a recovery of tension to near-control levels and in the return of the tension-pCa relation to its original position. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that the sensitivity to Ca2+ of a functional group within the thin filament may vary depending upon the state of activation of immediately adjacent groups.
