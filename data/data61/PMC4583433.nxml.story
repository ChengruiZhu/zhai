MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an important class of RNAs that regulate a wide range of biological processes by post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. The amount of literature describing experimentally validated miRNA targets is increasing rapidly, which poses a challenge to researchers and biocurators to stay up-to-date with the available information. Text mining methods have been used to extract miRNA-gene associated pairs and assist in curation. In this paper, we describe miRTex, a text mining system that extracts miRNA-target, miRNA-gene regulation and gene-miRNA regulation relations. We evaluate miRTex performance on two corpora, and show that the elaborate use of lexico-syntactic information and linguistic generalizations enables it to achieve the state-of-the-art performance. We have processed the all the Medline abstracts and all the full-length articles in the PubMed Central Open Access Subset with miRTex, and provide a website to access the extraction results from all the Medline abstracts. The full-scale text mining results will be a useful resource for miRNA researchers, while the miRTex tool itself can be integrated into literature-based curation pipelines. We present two use cases (for animal and plant miRNAs, respectively) that show how the full-scale text mining can be used in combination with other bioinformatics resources to gain insight into biological processes.
