Flat keratometry repeatability was 0.74±0.89 (0.03 to 5.26) diopters (D) in the LASIK Group A, 0.88±1.45 (range minimum to maximum, 0.00 to 7.84) D in the keratoconic Group B, and 0.71±0.94 (0.02 to 6.23) D in the cross-linked Group C. The control Group D had flat keratometry repeatability 0.36±0.46 (0.00 to 2.71) D. Steep keratometry repeatability was 0.64±0.82 (0.01 to 4.81) D in the LASIK Group A, 0.89±1.22 (0.02 to 7.85) D in the keratoconic Group B, and 0.93±1.12 (0.04 to 5.93) D in the cross-linked Group C. The control Group D had steep keratometry repeatability 0.41±0.50 (0.00 to 3.51) D. Axis repeatability was 3.45±1.62° (0.38 to 7.78°) for the LASIK Group A, 4.12±3.17° (0.02 to 12.13°) for the keratoconic Group B, and 3.20±1.99° (0.17 to 8.61°) for the cross-linked Group C. The control Group D had axis repeatability 2.16±1.39° (0.05 to 5.86°). The SAI index measurement repeatability was 0.33±0.40 (0.01 to 2.31) in the post-LASIK Group A, 0.39±0.75 (0.00 to 7.15) in the keratoconic Group B, and 0.43±0.56 (0.05 to 3.50) in the keratoconus post-CXL Group C. The control group had SAI measurement repeatability of 0.26±0.30 (0.00 to 2.39). The SRI index repeatability was 0.22±0.17 (0.01 to 0.96) for post-LASIK Group A, 0.20±0.18 (0.00 to 1.07) in keratoconic Group B, and 0.13±0.09 (0.00 to 0.45) in the keratoconus post-CXL Group C. The control Group D had SRI measurement repeatability of 0.23±0.16 (0.00 to 0.75).
