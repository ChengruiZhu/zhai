The same functional states that characterize the living anterior byssus retractor muscle (ABRM) from Mytilus edulis can be initiated in the saponin-treated (chemically skinned) muscle preparation under controlled biochemical conditions. A tonic contraction was induced if the concentration of free Ca2+ was above approximately 10(7) M in the presence of Mg2+ and ATP. Maximum tension development was achieved at a Ca2+ concentration of approximately 10(4) M. Within these Ca2+ concentrations tension was always associated with the presence of 'active state," as indicated by a high recovery of tension after a quick release in muscle length. Tonic tension, and the associated active state was maintained for hours during these conditions irrespective of variations in both ionic strength and pH. Reduction of the Ca2+ concentration to below threshold for tension initiation during a tonic contraction immediately switched off the active state and relaxation of the muscle preparation resulted. However, the rate of relaxation was extremely low, leaving a substantial fraction of tension in the absence of active state. Both 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and cAMP accelerated this slow relaxation in the absence of Ca2+. Thus, this state was considered equivalent to the 'catch state" in the living ABRM. In the presence of Ca2+ concentrations above 10(7) M, cAMP did not affect either the maximum tension developed or the Ca2+ sensitivity of the chemically skinned muscle preparation.
