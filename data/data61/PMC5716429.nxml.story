Age-related cataract (ARC) is a major cause of blindness. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a heterogeneous class of RNAs that are non-protein-coding transcripts >200 nucleotides in length. LncRNAs are involved in various critical biological processes, such as chromatin remodeling, gene transcription, and protein transport and trafficking. Furthermore, the dysregulation of lncRNAs causes a number of complex human diseases, including coronary artery diseases, autoimmune diseases, neurological disorders and various cancers. However, the role of lncRNA in cataract remains unclear. Therefore, in the present study, lens anterior capsular membrane was collected from normal subjects and patients with ARC and total RNA was extracted. High-throughput sequencing was applied to detect differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs. The analysis identified a total of 42,556 candidate differentially expressed mRNAs (27,447 +15,109) and a total of 7,041 candidate differentially expressed lncRNAs (4,146 + 2,895). Through bioinformatics analysis, the significant differential expression of novel lincRNA was observed and its possible molecular mechanism was explored. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to validate the different expression levels of selected lncRNAs. These findings may lead to the development of novel strategies for genetic diagnosis and gene therapy.
