The functionality of receptor and channel proteins depends directly upon their expression level on the plasma membrane. Therefore, the ability to selectively adjust the surface level of a particular receptor or channel protein is pivotal to many cellular signalling events. The internalization and recycling pathway plays a major role in the regulation of protein surface level, and thus has been a focus of research for many years. Although several endocytic pathways have been identified, most of our knowledge has come from the clathrin-dependent pathway, while the other pathways remain much less well defined. Considering that clathrin-independent internalization may account for as much as 50% of the total endocytic activity in the cell, the lack of such knowledge constitutes a major gap in our efforts to understand how different internalization pathways are utilized and co-ordinated. Recent studies have provided valuable insights into this area, yet many more questions still remain. In this review, we will give a panoramic introduction to the current knowledge of various internalization and recycling pathways, with an emphasis on the latest findings that have broadened our view of the clathrin-independent pathways. We will also dedicate one section to the emerging studies of the clathrin-independent internalization pathways in neuronal cells.
