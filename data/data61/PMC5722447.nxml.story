 or create his or her own fluence map using the matrix editor in the program. Through comprehensive calibrations of the dose and the dimension of the imported fluence field, the user can use associated image‐processing tools such as field resizing and edge trimming to modify the imported map. When the processed fluence map is suitable, a “MLC machine” file is generated for our Varian 21 EX linear accelerator with a 120‐leaf Millennium MLC. This machine file is transferred to the MLC console of the LINAC to control the continuous motions of the leaves during beam irradiation. An IMRT field is then irradiated with the 2D intensity profiles, and the irradiated profiles are compared to the imported or modified fluence map. This program was verified and tested using film dosimetry to address the following uncertainties: (1) the mechanical limitation due to the leaf width and maximum traveling speed, and (2) the dosimetric limitation due to the leaf leakage/transmission and penumbra effect. Because the fluence map can be edited, resized, and processed according to the requirement of a study, SWIMRT is essential in studying and investigating the IMRT technique using the sliding window algorithm. Using this program, future work on the algorithm may include redistributing the time space between segmental fields to enhance the fluence resolution, and readjusting the timing of each leaf during delivery to avoid small fields. Possible clinical utilities and examples for SWIMRT are given in this paper.
