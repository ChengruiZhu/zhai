Caveolin-1 (cav-1) has been implicated in the development of human cancers. However, the distribution of cav-1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and its significance require further study. Real-time PCR and Western blot assays were performed to detect cav-1 mRNA and protein levels in tumor tissues (TT) and matched tumor-free tissues (TF). The protein expression in 115 paraffin-embedded blocks was examined by immunohistochemical staining (IHC). Correlations between cav-1 mRNA and protein expression by IHC and clinicopathological features were statistically evaluated. For the 136 patients examined, the levels of cav-1 mRNA and protein expression were significantly lower in lung TT compared to matched TF (P<0.05). High cav-1 expression was detected in 60 of 115 (52.2%) NSCLC tissues and this level was significantly lower than cav-1 expression in non-cancerous lung tissues (15 of 19, 78.9%, P<0.05). Up-regulation of cav-1 mRNA expression in lung adenocarcinoma (AC) (29.7%) was higher than that observed in lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (15.8%). Statistical analysis of the correlation between cav-1 protein expression and clinical features showed a statistical association with poorer N-stage (P=0.032) and higher pathological TNM stage (P=0.012) in lung AC patients, that was not found in lung SCC patients. Moreover, lung AC patients with higher cav-1 expression showed significantly shorter life-spans than those with lower cav-1 expression (P=0.032, log-rank test). The levels of cav-1 mRNA and protein expression were significantly lower in lung cancers when compared to matched TF or non-cancerous lung tissues. The higher protein expression correlated with the advanced pathological stage and shorter survival rates in lung AC patients.
