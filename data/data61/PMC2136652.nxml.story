 the blood stream is not attributable to an increased trapping of circulating bacteria. 4 to 6 hours after the intravenous injection, however, an increased number of bacteria could be demonstrated in the obstructed kidney, apparently due to local multiplication, and by the end of 24 hours purulent infection was usually obvious. A comparatively large number of bacteria was required to cause infection, even in the kidney with obstruction. This appeared to be related to the small proportion of the intravenous inoculum which lodged in the kidney initially. Although bacteria could be demonstrated in the normal kidney for a week or more following intravenous injection it was not possible to induce active infection with equal regularity by ligating the ureter throughout this time. During the first 3 days the majority of obstructed kidneys developed infection, but after 5 or more days this occurred in only a small proportion of animals so treated. The reason for the difference, in relation to interval between intravenous injection and time of ligation, is not apparent. When the ureter was ligated but no intravenous injection of bacteria was given, staphylococcal infection developed in the obstructed kidney within 2 weeks in about one-third of the animals. Reasons are given for the belief that this was blood-borne infection, and not the result of contamination at the time of operation. Staphylococci were not recovered from the normal rat kidney. These "spontaneous" staphylococcal infections seldom developed when
