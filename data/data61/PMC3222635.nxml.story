Tissue-specific stem cells reside in specialized microenvironments (niches). How the generation of niche cells and resident stem cells is coordinated, and how their correct numerical ratios are regulated, remains poorly understood. Here, we examine the potential mechanisms of this process by analyzing the formation of the fly ovary. Specifically, we uncover a role for ecdysone, which is a steroid hormone renowned for its role in insect molting but that also controls many aspects of larval development in flies and mammals. We find that ecdysone signaling in fly larvae coordinates the development of niche cells relative to their resident germ line stem cells (GSCs). Ecdysone receptors initially serve as repressors of differentiation, allowing precursor cells of both niches and GSCs time to proliferate and attain correct cell numbers. Later, ecdysone receptors allow differentiation of niches while simultaneously maintaining GSC precursors in an undifferentiated state, until the newly formed niches can accommodate them. Finally, ecdysone induces the differentiation of GSC precursors that are not incorporated in niches. Our work exemplifies one possible solution to coordinating stem cell and niche development: using a common signal to affect both cell types. A further understanding of these and other mechanisms will offer novel insights into regeneration and could help guide cell-based therapies for various diseases.
