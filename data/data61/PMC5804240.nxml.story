Physical activity can enhance cognitive function and increase resistance against deleterious effects of stress on mental health. Enhanced cognitive function and stress resistance produced by exercise are conserved among vertebrates, suggesting that ubiquitous mechanisms may underlie beneficial effects of exercise. In the current review, we summarize the beneficial effects of exercise on cognitive function and stress resistance and discuss central and peripheral signaling factors that may be critical for conferring the effects of physical activity to brain circuits involved in cognitive function and stress. Additionally, it is suggested that norepinephrine and serotonin, highly conserved monoamines that are sensitive to exercise and able to modulate behavior in multiple species, could represent a convergence between peripheral and central exercise signals that mediate the beneficial effects of exercise. Finally, we offer the novel hypothesis that thermoregulation during exercise could contribute to the emotional effects of exercise by activating a subset of temperature-sensitive serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus that convey anxiolytic and stress-protective signals to forebrain regions. Throughout the review, we discuss limitations to current approaches and offer strategies for future research in exercise neuroscience.
