Vitiligo is an acquired depigmentary skin inflammatory disorder. The pathogenesis of inflammatory skin disease involves the release of cytokines from keratinocytes, including interleukin (IL)-1β. IL-22 belongs to a family of cytokines structurally related to IL-10, including IL-19, IL-20, IL-24, and IL-26. In contrast to IL-10, IL-22 has proinflammatory activities. Among skin cell populations only keratinocytes are the major targets of IL-22. In the present study, we demonstrated that IL-22 promoting IL-1β secretion from keratinocytes via the Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3)-caspase-1 pathway. It inhibited the expression of protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) of keratinocytes. However, IL-22 had no direct effect on normal human foreskin-derived epidermal melanocytes (NHEM). Considering the closely connection between keratinocytes and melanocytes, and the ability of keratinocytes to produce a plethora of cytokines, in the present work, we examined whether IL-22 could regulate melanocytes functions by keratinocytes participation. Keratinocytes were exposed to IL-22 and the conditional medium was collected. The effect of conditional medium on melanocytes was studied. The expressions of relative proteins were assessed by western blot. Influence of conditional medium on NHEM migration was assessed by Transwell method and the apoptosis by flow cytometry analysis. The IL-22-treating keratinocytes conditional medium inhibited melanogenesis and restrained the expressions of Rab GTPases of NHEM. In addition, the conditional medium suppressed melanocytes migration and induced apoptosis. Our results collectively indicated that IL-22 may potentiate IL-1β-mediated skin inflammation and result in participating in the inflammatory pathogenesis of vitiligo.
