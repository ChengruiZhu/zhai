We proposed to perform a basic dosimetry commissioning on a new imager system, the Varian aS1200 electronic portal imaging device (EPID) and TrueBeam 2.0 linear accelerator for flattened (FF) and flattening filter‐free (FFF) beams, then to develop an image‐based quality assurance (QA) model for verification of the system delivery accuracy for intensity‐modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatments. For dosimetry testing, linearity of dose response with MU, imager lag, and effectiveness of backscatter shielding were investigated. Then, an image‐based model was developed to convert images to planar dose onto a virtual water phantom. The model parameters were identified using energy fluence of the Acuros treatment planning system (TPS) and, reference dose profiles and output factors measured at depths of 5, 10, 15, and 20 cm in water phantom for square fields. To validate the model, its calculated dose was compared to measured dose from MapCHECK 2 diode arrays for 36 IMRT fields at 10 cm depth delivered with 6X, 6XFFF, 10X, and 10XFFF energies. An in‐house gamma function was used to compare planar doses pixel‐by‐pixel. Finally, the method was applied to the same IMRT fields to verify their pretreatment delivery dose compared with Eclipse TPS dose. For the EPID commissioning, dose linearity was within 0.4% above 5 MU and
