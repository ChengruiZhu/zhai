The main actions of metformin are as follows: To reduce hyperglycemia via the suppression of gluconeogenesis, improve glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity, and stimulate activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase during the treatment of diabetes mellitus. It is well known that metformin acts via complex mechanisms, including multitarget and multipathway mechanisms; however, the multi-targeted antidiabetic genes of metformin remain obscure. The present study aimed to perform transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of potential therapeutic target genes in the liver of metformin-treated Sprague-Dawley rats with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The type 2 diabetes rat model was established using streptozotocin. Fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, serum insulin and biological parameters were subsequently measured. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and proteins were identified in the rat livers by expression profile analysis and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ). A 1.5-fold alteration in gene expression, as determined using chip-based expression profile analysis, and a 1.2-fold alteration in protein expression, as determined using iTRAQ, were considered physiologically significant benchmarks, which were used to identify DEGS in metformin-treated rats with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The DEGs were verified using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blot analysis. Numerous hepatic genes involved in various metabolic pathways were affected by metformin; in particular, genes associated with lipid metabolism were markedly affected. Expression profile analysis and iTRAQ analysis suggested that carboxylesterase 1C subunit (Ces1C) and cholesterol 7Î±-hydroxylyase (Cyp7a1) may serve as important DEGs, which were validated by qPCR and western blot analysis. Ces1C and Cyp7a1 are the main enzymes in cholesterol metabolism, yet the result of western blotting was not consistent with qPCR. The present study demonstrated that metformin may affect the expression of numerous hepatic genes involved in metabolic pathways, particularly the lipid and cholesterol metabolic pathways. Ces1C and Cyp7a1 may be considered novel therapeutic target genes in the liver, which are involved in the antidiabetic effects of metformin.
