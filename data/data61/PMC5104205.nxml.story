F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography. The primary tumor and nodal maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) were recorded, and HIF-1α expression and clinical parameters, including tumor mass, estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) levels, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2), Ki-67 index, grade and histology, were analyzed. SUVmax was compared with clinicopathological parameters and HIF-1α expression. The median SUVmax values of the ER-negative and PgR-negative tumors were significantly increased compared with ER and PgR-positive tumors, respectively (P=0.004 and P=0.008). SUVmax differed significantly between the T2 and T3 tumors and the T1 tumors. The median SUVmax levels were higher in the Ki-67 expression >10% group than the Ki-67 index <10% group (P=0.001). Although the median SUVmax values in HER-2-positive and -negative tumors were similar, triple-negative tumors demonstrated significantly higher values (P=0.04). With regard to tumor grade, the median SUVmax was greater in the high-grade tumors compared with the low-grade tumors. SUVmax did not exhibit a significant correlation with HIF-1α expression; however, HIF-1α expression was associated with tumor size and PgR expression. HIF-1α expression increased with a larger tumor size (r=0.27; P=0.008) and decreased PgR expression (r=−0.26; P=0.0002). The axillary nodal SUVmax of the N1 tumors was significantly lower than the N2 and N3 tumors (P<0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, tumor size, Ki-67 expression and ER Allred score were independent factors that impacted SUVmax. The results of the present study indicated strong associations between tumor size, tumor grade, Ki-67 expression, triple-negativity, downregulated hormone receptor expression and SUVmax values. Conversely, there was no association observed between glucose uptake and levels of HIF-1α. Based on these results, it is suggested that the lack of assiocation between hypoxia and glucose uptake indicates phenotypic independence.
