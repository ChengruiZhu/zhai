160 ISO no. 40 cones (0.06 taper), 80 each of resilon and gutta-percha were taken as samples for the study. Both resilon and gutta-percha were divided into eight experimental groups of 20 cones (four groups each of resilon and gutta-percha) for immersion in xylene, tetrachloroethylene, refined orange oil and distilled water. Each group was further divided into two equal subgroups (n=10) for 2- and 5-minute immersion time intervals at room temperature to investigate the potential of these solvents for clinical use in dissolving resilon and gutta-percha. Each sample was weighed initially before immersing in the solvent on a digital analytical scale. Distilled water served as a control. Samples were removed from the respective solvents after the specified immersion period and washed in 100 ml of distilled water and allowed to dry for 24 h at 37°C in a humidifier. The samples were then again weighed after immersion in the specific solvent on a digital analytical scale. The extent of gutta-percha or resilon removed from the specimen was calculated from the difference between the original weight of gutta-percha or resilon sample and its final weight. Means and standard deviations of percentage loss of weight were calculated at each time interval for each group of specimens. The values were compared by statistical parametric tests using SPSS 16.0 Software. The data was subjected to paired ‘
