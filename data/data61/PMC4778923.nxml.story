An important challenge in both evolutionary and developmental biology is understanding the genetic and molecular basis for the differences in phenotype that we observe between species. Although changes to regulatory interactions during development often play a critical role in this process, we lack detailed examples of how these differences evolve within the context of developmental gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and across the broader transcriptome as a whole. To better understand how evolutionary changes in gene regulation contribute to phenotypic differences between species, we developed a novel analytical framework to compare gene expression profiles between sea urchin species that exhibit either planktotrophic (feeding) or lecithotrophic (nonfeeding, yolk-dependent) development. We found that the shift from planktotrophy to lecithotrophy was accompanied by substantial changes to underlying gene expression profiles, and that this contrast was even more pronounced within the well-defined developmental GRN in sea urchins than across the transcriptome as a whole. Our analyses also identify cases of expression change in key regulatory genes with known developmental roles and further highlight novel candidates that may underlie derived traits in the lecithotrophic species. The comparative framework that we develop and model here is a valuable tool for identifying evolutionary changes in gene expression between species and can be readily implemented in other systems.
