Wallerian degeneration or nerve demyelination, arising from spinal nerve compression, is thought to bring on chronic neuropathic pain. The widely distributed metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) is involved in modulating nociceptive transmission. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential effects of mGluR5 on peripheral hypersensitivities after chronic constriction injury (CCI). Sprague-Dawley rats were operated on with four loose ligatures around the sciatic nerve to induce thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia. Primary afferents in dermis after CCI exhibited progressive decreases, defined as partial cutaneous denervation; importantly, mGluR5 expressions in primary afferents were statistically increased. CCI-induced neuropathic pain behaviors through the intraplantar injections of 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP), a selective mGluR5 antagonist, were dose-dependently attenuated. Furthermore, the most increased mGluR5 expressions in primary afferents surrounded by reactive Schwann cells were observed at the distal CCI stumps of sciatic nerves. In conclusion, these results suggest that nerve demyelination results in the increases of mGluR5 expression in injured primary afferents after CCI; and further suggest that mGluR5 represents a main therapeutic target in developing pharmacological strategies to prevent peripheral hypersensitivities.
