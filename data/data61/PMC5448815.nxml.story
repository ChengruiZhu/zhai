The discovery of expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) from the analysis of genome-wide genotype and gene expression data has played an important role in the study of cellular processes and complex disease. Here, we introduce CONFETI: Confounding Factor Estimation Through Independent component analysis, an analysis framework that has been designed to identify eQTL with broad impacts on the expression levels of many genes. The CONFETI framework takes advantage of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to separate putative genetic and non-genetic factors in a confounding factor mixed model analysis, such that broad impact eQTL are not corrected out of the analysis as confounding variation. We show that CONFETI has better performance for identifying broad impact eQTL compared to the most widely applied confounding factor correction methods when applied to simulated data. We also applied CONFETI and these same methods to identify eQTL that replicate between twin pairs from the MuTHER consortium, the Depression Genes Networks study (DGN), the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA), and common tissue type pairs in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) consortium. Surprisingly, while CONFETI had comparable replication performance compared to other methods, we were able to identify and replicate a very small number of broad impact eQTL overall. We discuss reports of broad impact eQTL in humans and suggest that they should be interpreted with caution.
