The purpose of this work was to develop a method for easily verifying that the activity or air kerma strength of pre‐assembled eye plaques, used in the treatment of ocular melanomas, agrees with the activity or air kerma strength called for in the treatment plan. A Capintec CRC‐7 Dose Calibrator with its standard vial/syringe sample holder was used to measure the activity of pre‐assembled COMS and Eye Physics EP917 eye plaques using IsoAid Advantage I‐125 seeds. Plaque activity measurements were made by placing the plaque face up in the center of a 5 cm tall Styrofoam insert in the source holder. Activity measurements were made with the source holder rotated to four angles (0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°). The average of these four values was converted to air kerma strength and divided by the assay air kerma strength, from the NIST traceable source calibration, and decayed to the plaque measurement date, to determine a plaque calibration factor. The average of the calibration factors for each plaque type was used to establish a calibration factor for each plaque type. Several partially loaded plaque configurations were included in this study and different methods were used to determine the effects of partial loading. This verification method is easy to implement with commonly available equipment and is effective in identifying possible errors. During this two‐year study, the air kerma strength of 115 eye plaques was checked and 11 possible errors were identified.
