 oocytes and currents were recorded from excised membrane patches. The accessibility of the substituted cysteines from both sides of the plasma membrane was tested with the thiol-specific reagents 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA) and [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate (MTSET). Residues V4C, T20C, and P22C were accessible to MTSET only from the external side of the plasma membrane, and to MTSEA from both sides of the plasma membrane. The effect of MTSEA applied to the inner side of T20C and P22C was prevented by adding 10 mM cysteine to the external side of the plasma membrane. W9C was accessible to MTSET from the internal side only. L7C residue was accessible to internal MTSET, but the inhibition was partial, âˆ¼50% when the MTS compound was applied in the absence of cGMP and 25% when it was applied in the presence of cGMP, suggesting that this residue is not located inside the pore lumen and that it changes its position during gating. Currents from T15C and T16C mutants were rapidly potentiated by intracellular MTSET. In T16C, a slower partial inhibition took place after the initial potentiation. Current from I17C progressively decayed in inside-out patches. The rundown was accelerated by inwardly applied MTSET. The accessibility results of MTSET indicate a well-defined topology of the channel pore in which residues between L7 and I17 are inwardly accessible, residue G18 and E19 form the narrowest section of the pore, and T20, P21, P22 and V4 are outwardly accessible.
