Gating currents were measured by subtracting the linear component of the capacitative current recorded at very positive or very negative potentials. When the membrane is depolarized for a few minutes, repolarized to the usual holding potential (HP) of --70 mV for 1 ms, and then pulsed to 0 mV, the charge transferred in 2--4 ms is approximately 50% of that which was transferred during the same pulse holding at --70 mV. This charge decrease, called slow inactivation of the gating current, was found to be consistent with a shift of the charge vs. potential (Q-V) curve to more hyperpolarized potentials. When the HP is 0 mV, the total charge available to move is the same as the total charge available when the HP is --70 mV. The time constants of the fast component of the ON gating current are smaller at depolarized holding potentials than at --70 mV. When the HP is --70 mV and a prepulse of 50 ms duration is given to 0 mV, the Q-V curve is also shifted to more hyperpolarized potentials (charge immobilization), but the effect is not as pronounced as the one obtained by holding at 0 mV. When the HP is 0 mV, a prepulse to --70 mV for 50 ms partially shifts back the Q-V curve, indicating that fast inactivation of the gating charge may be recovered in the presence of slow inactivation. A physical model consisting of a gating particle that interacts with a fast inactivating particle, and a slow inactivating particle, reproduces most of the experimental results.
