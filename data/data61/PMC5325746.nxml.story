Both polycystic liver disease (PLD) and sarcoidosis can involve liver. Most of the time, liver disease in both conditions is asymptomatic, but they can rarely cause portal hypertension. Our aim is to report a case of a 51-year-old female with a history of adult dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and sarcoidosis who presented with multiple episodes of hematemesis. An endoscopy showed grade 3 esophageal varices. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed ascites with polycystic liver, nodular contour, and calcified granuloma. PLD can cause portal hypertension due to fibrosis or large cysts compressing on the portal vein. On the other hand, sarcoidosis causes portal hypertension by formation of arteriovenous(AV) shunts or fibrosis in areas of granulomas. Both conditions are diagnosed on imaging. There is no approved medical treatment for PLD; the only curative treatment is liver transplantation. Asymptomatic hepatic sarcoidosis does not need any treatment. The recommended treatment is corticosteroids for both isolated and systemic sarcoidosis. ADPKD and sarcoidosis can involve multiple organs. The presence of both conditions can accelerate the disease process and could be a therapeutic challenge. Early abdominal imaging during the course of both diseases can improve the outcome by decreasing the diagnostic window.
