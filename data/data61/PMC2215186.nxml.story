Effects of reduction in potassium conductance on impulse conduction were studied in squid giant axons. Internal perfusion of axons with tetraethylammonium (TEA) ions reduces G K and causes the duration of action potential to be increased up to 300 ms. This prolongation of action potentials does not change their conduction velocity. The shape of these propagating action potentials is similar to membrane action potentials in TEA. Axons with regions of differing membrane potassium conductances are obtained by perfusing the axon trunk and one of its two main branches with TEA after the second branch has been filled with normal perfusing solution. Although the latter is initially free of TEA, this ion diffuses in slowly. Up until a large amount of TEA has diffused into the second branch, action potentials in the two branches have very different durations. During this period, membrane regions with prolonged action potentials are a source of depolarizing current for the other, and repetitive activity may be initiated at transitional regions. After a single stimulus in either axon region, interactions between action potentials of different durations usually led to rebound, or a short burst, of action potentials. Complex interactions between two axon regions whose action potentials have different durations resembles electric activity recorded during some cardiac arrhythmias.
