Although periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease but some factors of acute inflammation phase are involved in this disease among which is the C-Reactive protein (CRP). To minimize its effects, anti-inflammatory drugs or non-pharmacological approaches such as oral hygiene is recommended. CRP can also be used for the prediction and early detection of periodontal disease. The aim of the present study was the comparison of the amount of salivary C-Reactive protein (CRP) in healthy subjects and patients with periodontal disease. This case-control study was done on 90 patients referred to the Department of Periodontology of Babol Dentistry School. These subjects were divided into three groups of healthy (n = 30), gingivitis (n = 30), and chronic periodontitis (n = 30), based on Gingival Index (GI) and Clinical Attachment Loss (CAL) indices. 2ml saliva samples were collected from these people and clinical indicators including GI, CAL, Periodontal Pocket Depth (PPD), and Bleeding Index (BI) were assessed. ELISA method was used to evaluate the salivary CRP levels. Collected data were analyzed using SPSS statistical software by non-Parametric Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney test and Spearman correlation coefficient and P<0.05 was considered significant. The mean salivary CRP levels were 5332.62±5051.63pg/ml in periodontitis patients, 3545.41±3061.38pg/ml in gingivitis group and 3108.51±3574.47pg/ml in healthy subjects. The statistic analysis showed a significant difference in salivary CRP concentrations between the periodontitis patients and healthy subjects (P=0.045). The results indicate that there is a significant association between periodontitis and salivary CRP concentrations.
