The aim of the study was to investigate the expression and clinical significance of early growth response protein 1 (EGR-1) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in the pituitary tumors of elderly patients. From January 2014 to December 2015, we collected 25 patient cases with non-invasive pituitary tumors, 10 cases with invasive pituitary tumors and 35 cases with healthy pituitary tissues (the healthy control group). Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect the expression of EGR-1 and PTEN, and analyze specific differences. The expression of EGR-1 and PTEN in patients with invasive and non-invasive pituitary tumors increased significantly, when compared with the healthy control group, and the difference was statistically significant (p<0.05). In patients with invasive tumors, EGR-1 levels were higher than levels in patients with non-invasive tumors. The difference was statistically significant (p<0.05). PTEN levels in patients with invasive tumors were significantly lower than levels in patients with non-invasive tumors. The difference was statistically significant (p<0.05). In conclusion, EGR-1 and PTEN levels in patients with pituitary tumors were significantly higher. In addition, EGR-1 levels were higher in patients with invasive pituitary tumors, while PTEN levels were lower. The combination of increases in both levels highlights an important role in the evaluation and prognosis of elderly patients with pituitary tumors.
