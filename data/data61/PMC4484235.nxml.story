Intravertebral cleft (IVC) is frequently observed in patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF). Some studies reported the usefulness of percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) for treating OVCF with IVC. However, systematic studies are scarce, and their results are conflicting. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and radiographic results of PVP in the treatment of painful OVCF with IVC. Two hundred ninety-one patients with OVCF with IVC underwent PVP. Back pain was measured using a visual analog scale (VAS), and physical disability was assessed using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Three radiological parameters were assessed: the local kyphotic angle, percentage spinal canal cross-sectional area of compromise, and intravertebral instability of the affected vertebra. The mean follow-up period was 28 months. The mean values for the VAS and ODI were 8.4 and 60.0%, respectively, before PVP, versus 3.9 and 35.4%, respectively, at the final follow-up. The average local kyphotic angle, percentage spinal canal cross-sectional area of compromise, and intravertebral instability were 10.5째, 17.9% and 6.1째, respectively, before PVP and 8.1째, 15.2%, and 0.8째, respectively, at the final follow-up. There were no neurological or systemic complications due to cement leakage. PVP is an effective and safe intervention for treating OVCF with IVC.
