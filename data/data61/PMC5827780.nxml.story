Sample amount is often a limiting factor for multi-parametric analyses that encompass at least three areas of ‘-omics’ research: genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics. Limited sample amounts are also an important consideration when these multi-parametric analyses are performed on extracellular vesicles (EVs), as the amount of EVs (and EV cargo) that can be isolated is often very low. It is well understood that a monophasic solution of phenol and guanidine isothiocyanate (i.e. TRIzol©) can simultaneously isolate DNA, RNA and proteins from biological samples; however, it is most commonly used for the extraction of RNA. Validation of this reagent for the isolation of multiple classes of biological molecules from EVs would provide a widely applicable method for performing multi-parametric analyses of EV material. In this report, we describe a comparison of proteins identified from EVs processed with either TRIzol© or the conventional Laemmli buffer protein-extraction reagents. EVs were isolated from 3 mL of cell-culture supernatant derived from MCF-10A, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells using the Vn96 EV capture technology. For the TRIzol© extraction protocol, proteins were precipitated with acetone from the organic phase and then re-solubilized in a mixture of 8M urea, 0.2% SDS and 1 M Tris-HCl pH 6.8, followed by dilution in 5× loading buffer prior to fractionation with 1D SDS-PAGE. NanoLC-MS/MS of the trypsin-digested proteins was used to generate proteomic profiles from EV protein samples extracted with each method. Of the identified proteins, 57.7%, 69.2% and 57.0% were common to both extraction methods for EVs from MCF-10A, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, respectively. Our results suggest that TRIzol© extraction of proteins from EVs has significant equivalence to the traditional Laemmli method. The advantage of using TRIzol© reagent is the ability to accumulate multi-parametric data (e.g., RNA and protein profiles) on the same limited EV sample while minimizing sample preparation and processing time.
