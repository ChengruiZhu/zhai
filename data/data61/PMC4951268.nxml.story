The prognosis of metastatic osteosarcoma is dismal and a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying disease progression is essential to improve treatment options and patient outcomes. We previously demonstrated Pla2g16 overexpression in mouse osteosarcoma contributes to metastasis phenotypes and increased expression of PLA2G16 is associated with metastasis and poor prognosis in human tumors. To further examine the mechanisms through which PLA2G16 contributes to human osteosarcoma metastasis and explore the potential of PLA2G16 as a therapeutic target in osteosarcoma, we generated a panel of human osteosarcoma cell lines expressing different levels of PLA2G16. The functional analyses of these cell lines demonstrated high levels of PLA2G16 expression increased osteosarcoma cell migration, invasion, clonogenic survival, and anchorage-independent colony formation. Importantly, this activity was dependent on the phospholipase activity of PLA2G16. Additionally, PLA2G16 overexpression decreased the sensitivity of cells to a panel of chemotherapeutic agents. Analysis of downstream pathways revealed the pro-metastasis functions of PLA2G16 were mediated through the MAPK pathway, as knockdown of PLA2G16 decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation and pharmacological inhibition of MEK significantly repressed PLA2G16 mediated cell migration and clonogenic survival. Furthermore, PLA2G16 overexpression promoted xenograft tumor growth
