Autophagy, a process in which cellular components are engulfed and degraded within double-membrane vesicles termed autophagosomes, has an important role in the response to oxidative damage. Here we identify a novel cascade of phosphorylation events, involving a network of protein and lipid kinases, as crucial components of the signaling pathways that regulate the induction of autophagy under oxidative stress. Our findings show that both the tumor-suppressor death-associated protein kinase (DAPk) and protein kinase D (PKD), which we previously showed to be phosphorylated and consequently activated by DAPk, mediate the induction of autophagy in response to oxidative damage. Furthermore, we map the position of PKD within the autophagic network to Vps34, a lipid kinase whose function is indispensable for autophagy, and demonstrate that PKD is found in the same molecular complex with Vps34. PKD phosphorylates Vps34, leading to activation of Vps34, phosphatydilinositol-3-phosphate (PI(3)P) formation, and autophagosome formation. Consistent with its identification as a novel inducer of the autophagic machinery, we show that PKD is recruited to LC3-positive autophagosomes, where it localizes specifically to the autophagosomal membranes. Taken together, our results describe PKD as a novel Vps34 kinase that functions as an effecter of autophagy under oxidative stress.
