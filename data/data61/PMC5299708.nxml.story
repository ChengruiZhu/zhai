Abnormal features of the systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-derived neutrophils, promoted aberrant immune response, have inspired new studies of the induction of autoimmunity and the development of organ damage in SLE. In this study, we explore the effect of milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 (MFG-E8) on the aberrant nitrification features in pristane-induced lupus. SLE patients and mice with pristane-induced lupus develop autoantibodies associated with MFG-E8 overproduction. However, the deletion of MFG-E8 leads to uncontrolled early pulmonary and peritoneal inflammation and tissue damage in mice with pristane-induced lupus. Consistent with these findings, MFG-E8-deficient mice that are exposed to pristane show enhanced neutrophil accumulation and increased neutrophil death, including apoptosis, necrosis and NETosis, as well as impaired phagocytosis of macrophages. The consequences are the expansion of diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage, increased anti-nuclear antibody, anti-dsDNA antibody and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody levels, and enhanced immune complexes deposition and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation in the lung and kidney tissues of MFG-E8-deficient mice exposed to pristane. In patients with SLE and mice with pristane-induced lupus, neutrophil accumulation is elevated, which depends on higher expression of the surface receptor CXCR2. After pretreatment with recombinant MFG-E8, the surface expression of CXCR2 on neutrophil is downregulated, and the MFG-E8 deletion increase CXCR2 expression by ~40%. These studies indicate that MFG-E8 reduces neutrophil migration and NETosis via downregulating surface CXCR2 expression in parallel with its role in the phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils, suggesting that MFG-E8 may serve as a therapeutic agent for attenuating the early inflammatory responses of SLE and protect patients from lupus-related damage.
