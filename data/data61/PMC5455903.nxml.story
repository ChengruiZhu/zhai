954 meniscal repairs were performed on 918 patients (n = 536 males [58%] and 382 females [42%]) with a mean age of 23 years (12-60). 64% underwent medial meniscal repair and 36% underwent lateral meniscal repair. 4% were repaired both medially and laterally. 75% of the repairs were performed using meniscal sutures (predominantly Fast-Fix), and 25% of the meniscal tears were repaired using bioabsorbable arrows (Biofix). The median time from injury to surgery was 23 days (0-360). The reoperation rate in the whole cohort was 29%. 35% of the medial meniscal repairs failed and 17% failures were noted on the lateral side. Repair with bioabsorbable arrows on the medial meniscus resulted in reoperation in 44% of the cases, whereas the reoperation rate for meniscal sutures was 32% on the medial side. On the lateral side 18% failures were noticed when using arrows, and 17% when sutures were used. 62% of the patients had a simultaneous anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. When medial meniscal repair was preformed with simultaneous ACL-reconstruction 26% of the meniscal repairs failed, when no simultaneous ACL- reconstruction was performed 37% of the meniscal repairs failed and with no associated ACL-injury 41% of the meniscal repairs failed. Analyzing failure in a multivariate cox regression, adjusted according to age, gender, meniscus, ACL-pathology and days- to-surgery, revealed a higher failure rate for medial meniscal repairs (HR 3.006 [2.074-4.355; p = 0.000). Bioabsorbable arrows had significantly more failures than meniscal sutures (HR 1.656 [1.207-2.273]; p = 0.002). With reference to no ACL injury, meniscal repairs performed with a simultaneous ACL-reconstruction resulted in less failure than when no simultaneous ACL-reconstruction was performed (HR 0.605 [0.413-0.885]; p = 0.010).
