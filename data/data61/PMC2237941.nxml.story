-cresol or 2,4,5-trichlorophenol, being most marked in suboptimum concentrations and least marked in greater than optimum concentrations of the substituted phenol. In contrast to this result, the reduction of the stimulated respiration by a given concentration of 5-isoamyl-5-ethyl barbituric acid or malonic acid is least marked in suboptimum concentrations and most marked in greater than optimum concentrations of the substituted phenol. 3. The present experiments appear to indicate that the inhibition of cell division by substituted phenols is not attributable to a direct action of these agents on mitotic processes nor to an overstimulation of any respiratory process. The inhibition of cell division appears to be associated with the inhibition, by the substituted phenols, of some component of the cyanide sensitive respiratory system. This inhibition is of such a type as to allow the overall respiration to proceed at a rate in excess of the control value, even when division is completely suppressed. The dependence of the division mechanism on a respiratory step which is relatively hypersensitive to poisoning by the substituted phenols is comparable to the dependence of the Pasteur reaction in certain normal and tumor tissues on an oxidative step which is specifically poisoned by the substituted phenols (16). The substituted phenols have no inhibiting effect
