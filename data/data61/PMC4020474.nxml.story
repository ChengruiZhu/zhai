The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of Islet-1 on the process of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation into cardiomyocyte-like cells and to elucidate the possible mechanisms involved. Lentiviral vectors expressing Islet-1 (Lenti-Islet-1) were constructed and used for C3H10T1/2 cell transfection. Cell morphology was observed. Cardiac-related genes and proteins were detected by qPCR and western blot analysis. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was used as an inhibitor of acetylated histone H3 (AcH3). AcH3 was detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Cells overexpressing Islet-1 tended to change into fibroblast-like cells and were arranged in the same direction. The enhanced expression of GATA binding protein 4 (Gata4), NK2 homeobox 5 (Nkx2.5), myocyte enhancer factor 2C (Mef2c) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) was observed in the cells overexpressing Islet-1 following transfection with Lenti-Islet-1. However, the expression of hepatocyte-, bone- and neuronal-specific markers was not affected by Islet-1. The AcH3 relative amount increased following transfection with Lenti-Islet-1, which was associated with the enhanced expression of Gata4, Nkx2.5 and Mef2c in these cells. The expression of Gata4, Nkx2.5 and Mef2c in the C3H10T1/2 cells transfected with Lenti-Islet-1 and treated with EGCG was reduced following treatment with EGCG. The data presented in this study indicate that Islet-1 specifically induces the differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells into cardiomyocyte-like cells, and one of the mechanisms involved is the regulation of histone acetylation.
