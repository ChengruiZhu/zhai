Hyperuricemia is associated with hypertension and progressive chronic renal disease. This is a retrospective cohort study in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with hyperuricemia from 1998 to 2008. Patients were divided into two groups: treatment group who received allopurinol in a dose of 100 mg/day and the other group remained untreated. Clinical, hematologic, biochemical parameters and outcome were measured at baseline and 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years of treatment. A total of 183 patients were enrolled. Mean age of the allopurinol group was 50.15 ± 14.42 years and control group was 53.23 ± 13.86 years. Male-female ratios were 2.57:1 and 2.21:1 for the treatment and control groups, respectively. Baseline characteristics and the laboratory parameters were similar in both groups. Patients who received allopurinol had lower blood pressure at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years when compared to baseline. There was a significant decrease in the serum uric acid (UA) levels in the treatment group at the end of 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years with respect to base line. An inverse correlation as noted between serum UA levels and the estimated glomerular filtration rate at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. Allopurinol treatment decreases blood UA levels and is associated with better blood pressure control and decreased progression of renal disease in CKD patients with hyperuricemia.
