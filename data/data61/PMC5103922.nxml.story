Thymidine phosphorylase (TP) is structurally similar to platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor, and it activates 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) prodrugs and also promotes angiogenesis. In the present study, the possibility of using TP expression as a biomarker for 5-FU prodrugs, and the significance of TP as an angiogenic factor, were investigated in patients with gynecological tumors. The subjects enrolled in the study were 188 patients with gynecological tumors who provided informed consent and underwent tumor resection at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Tokai University Hospital between February 2002 and January 2010. Measurement of the enzymatic activity of TP and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) was performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of microvessels by monochrome imaging, western blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were performed. The mean TP activity and the TP/DPD ratio were increased in squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix (306.9 and 2.2 U/mg protein, respectively) and adenosquamous carcinoma (317.6 and 1.4 U/mg protein, respectively) compared with benign tumors and other malignancies, including endometrial (uterine) carcinoma, ovarian serous adenocarcinoma and ovarian mucinous adenocarcinoma. However, these parameters were also elevated in other histological types of cancer such as clear cell adenocarcinoma of the ovary (115.2 and 2.1 U/mg protein, respectively), in which the microvessel area was the largest of all the histological types analyzed. Since high TP expression and a high TP/DPD ratio were identified in other tumors besides cervical cancer, it is possible that patients for whom 5-FU prodrugs are indicated could be selected appropriately if their TP activity is determined and their TP expression is analyzed by IHC prior to initiation of the treatment.
