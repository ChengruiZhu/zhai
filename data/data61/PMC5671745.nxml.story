To evaluate RNA oxidation in the early stage of diabetic nephropathy, we applied an accurate method based on isotope dilution high-performance liquid chromatography-triple quadruple mass spectrometry to analyze the oxidatively generated guanine nucleosides in renal tissue and urine from db/db mice of different ages. We further investigated the relationship between these oxidative stress markers, microalbumin excretion, and histological changes. We found that the levels of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine (8-oxoGuo) and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2â€²-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodGuo) were increased in the urine and renal tissue of db/db mice and db/db mice with early symptoms of diabetic nephropathy suffered from more extensive oxidative damage than lean littermate control db/m mice. Importantly, in contrast to the findings in db/m mice, the 8-oxoGuo levels in the urine and renal tissue of db/db mice were higher than those of 8-oxodGuo at four weeks. These results indicate that RNA oxidation is more apparent than DNA oxidation in the early stage of diabetic nephropathy. RNA oxidation may provide new insight into the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy, and urinary 8-oxoGuo may represent a novel, noninvasive, and easily detected biomarker of diabetic kidney diseases if further study could clarify its source and confirm these results in a large population study.
