A 34-year-old woman presented with pain during menstruation and was diagnosed with endometriosis of the lower rectum. Despite treatment with an LH-RH agonist, she was unable to become pregnant and surgical removal of her endometriosis was recommended. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging revealed endometriosis localized between the neck of the uterus and rectum with indentation and scuffing. Laparoscopically assisted low anterior resection was performed. Exfoliation was started from the right side of the rectum to the presacral and retrorectal space, and the rectococcygeus ligament was transected. Exfoliation of the retrorectal space was continued to the levator ani muscle and mobilization of the right side of the rectum was performed. In front of the rectum, exfoliation was started posterior to the wall of the vagina, but layers became unclear near the tumor as the tissue was solid in this region. The left hypogastric nerve close to the tumor was inflamed and it was cut. The layer of the exfoliation was connected to the right side of the rectum, the tumor was isolated from the vagina, and the lower rectum was transected at a point 1 cm distal to the tumor with a 60-mm linear stapler. Reconstruction with a 31-mm circular stapler was performed using the double stapling technique. Operative time was 520 min with a blood loss of 320 ml. On the 9th post operative day, a rectovaginal fistula occurred, and ileostomy was performed. The patient was discharged from the hospital on the 25th postoperative day, and 4 months later, stoma closure was performed.
