Studies have been carried out on human erythrocytes to examine the alterations of K transport induced by swelling or shrinking the cells by osmotic and isosmotic methods. Hypotonic swelling of erythrocytes (relative cell volume, 1.20) resulted in a striking, four- to fivefold augmentation in the ouabain-resistant K influx over the value obtained at a normal cell volume. Shrinking the cells in hypertonic media resulted in a small but statistically significant reduction in K influx. Three different methods of varying cell volume gave similar results. These include the addition of sucrose and of NaCl to hypotonic media and the isosmotic (nystatin) method. The major fraction of the K influx in swollen cells is specific in its requirement for Cl or Br and is not supported by thiocyanate, iodide, nitrate, methylsulfate, or acetate. Bumetanide (0.1 mM), MK-196 (0.2 mM), and piretanide (1 mM) are poorly effective in suppressing K uptake in swollen cells, but at higher concentrations, bumetanide (1 mM) inhibits 80% of the Cl- dependent K influx in swollen cells. The bumetanide concentration required to inhibit 50% of the Cl-dependent K influx is 0.17 mM. The volume-sensitive K influx is independent of both extracellular and intracellular Na, so that the (Na + K + 2Cl) cotransport pathway is not a likely mediator of the volume-sensitive K transport. A variety of inhibitors of the Ca-activated K channel are ineffective in suppressing swelling-induced K influx. Like K uptake, the efflux of K is also enhanced by cell swelling. Swelling-activated K efflux is Cl dependent, is independent of extracellular and intracellular Na, and is observed with both hypotonic and isosmotic methods of cell swelling. The activation of K efflux by cell swelling is observed in K-free media, which suggests that the volume-sensitive K transport pathway is capable of net K efflux. The addition of external K to hypotonic media resulted in an increase in K efflux compared with the efflux in K-free media, and this increase was probably due to K/K exchange. Thus, hypotonic or isosmotic swelling of human erythrocytes results in the activation of a ouabain-resistant, Cl-dependent, Na-independent transport pathway that is capable of mediating both net K efflux and K/K exchange.
