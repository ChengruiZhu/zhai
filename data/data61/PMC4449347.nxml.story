Therapeutic options for patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remain limited. In a multicenter, Phase II study, 65 patients with histologically confirmed CRPC received a biomodulatory regimen during the six-month core study. Treatment comprised daily doses of imatinib mesylate, pioglitazone, etoricoxib, treosulfan and dexamethasone. The primary endpoint was prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response. Responders could enter an extension phase until disease progression or intolerable toxicity occurred. Mean PSA was 45.3 ng/mL at baseline, and 77 % of patients had a PSA doubling time <3 months. Of the 61 evaluable patients, 37 patients (60.6 %) responded or had stable disease and 23 of them (37.7 % of 61 patients) were PSA responders. Among the 23 responders mean PSA decreased from 278.9 ± 784.1 ng/mL at baseline to 8.8 ± 11.6 ng/mL at the final visit (week 24). The progression-free survival (PFS) was 467 days in the ITT population. Of the 947 adverse events, 57.6 % were suspected to be drug-related, 13.8 % led to dose adjustment or permanent discontinuation and 40.2 % required concomitant medication. This novel combination approach led to an impressive PSA response rate of 37.7 % in CRPC patients. The good PSA response and PFS rate combined with the manageable toxicity profile suggest an alternative treatment option.
