Genetic risk prediction plays a significant role in precision medicine. Accurate prediction models could have great impact on disease prevention and treatment strategies. However, prediction accuracies for most complex diseases remain moderate mainly due to the challenges in identifying and quantifying the effects of genetic variants from millions of markers, limited access to individual-level genotype data, and lack of efficient computational methods. Up to now, most methods have been focused on predicting disease risk using data from a single trait. With the discovery of genetic correlations among many complex diseases, incorporating data of genetically correlated diseases could have the potential to increase prediction accuracy. Current statistical methods are not able to fully exploit the richness of these kinds of data to take into account the shared genetic architecture. To make use of commonly available GWAS summary statistics, we propose a novel method to address these challenges by jointly modeling genetically correlated diseases and integrating genomic functional annotations. We demonstrate the substantial improvement in accuracy in both extensive simulation studies and real data analysis of Crohnâ€™s disease, celiac disease and type-II diabetes. Furthermore, we show that the increment in prediction accuracy is significantly correlated with the genetic correlation between the predicted and jointly modeled diseases.
