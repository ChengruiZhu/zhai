The aim of the present study was to assess the short-term outcome and survival time of 166 obese patients who received laparoscopic and open colectomy for colorectal cancer (CRC) between January 2007 and December 2012. All 166 patients included in the study had a BMI >28. Laparoscopic or open colectomy procedures were performed on 64 and 102 patients, respectively. The short-term outcome and post-operative survival rates were compared. The patient characteristics were similar between the two groups. Laparoscopic colectomy correlated with an increased duration of surgery compared with open colectomy (183 vs. 167 min, respectively; P<0.05) but intraoperative blood loss was decreased (168 vs. 188 ml, respectively; P<0.05). Hospitalization costs were slightly higher following the laparoscopic procedure compared with open surgery, but this was affordable for the majority of patients (¥56,484 vs. ¥56,161, respectively; P<0.05). The incidence of wound infection (17 vs. 31%; P<0.05) and abdominal abscess rates (6 vs. 18%; P<0.05) were reduced in the laparoscopic group compared with the open group. Pathological characteristics were identified to be similar and no significant differences were identified in overall (log-rank test; P=0.85) and disease-free (log-rank test; P=0.85) survival between the two types of surgery (log-rank test; P=0.76). The current retrospective study demonstrated an improved short-term outcome in laparoscopic colectomy for CRC patients with a BMI >28 compared with patients who underwent the open procedure. Laparoscopic colectomy is technically and oncologically safe and must be popularized in obese CRC patients.
