Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic disorder that is characterized by the formation of noncaseating granulomas. Although sarcoidosis can affect any organ, gastrointestinal tract involvement in sarcoidosis is very rare, and gastric cancer associated with gastric sarcoidosis has hardly been reported. A 64-year-old female with a 10-year history of the medical treatment of gastric sarcoidosis received a routine follow-up gastrointestinal endoscopy and an irregular-shaped, elevated lesion was detected in the gastric corpus. The gastric mucosal surface was nodular and ulcerated throughout the stomach. The gastric lumen was narrow, and the gastric wall was stiff and nondistensible, resembling linitis plastica. The biopsies of the elevated lesion in the gastric corpus revealed well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. An endoscopic ultrasonography was then performed, but it failed to assess precisely the depth of cancer invasion because of sarcoidosis-related gastritis and fibrosis of the gastric wall. The patient underwent a laparoscopic total gastrectomy under the diagnosis of gastric cancer associated with gastric sarcoidosis. Histologic examination of the surgical specimen demonstrated well-differentiated adenocarcinoma in the gastric corpus, and the histologic mapping of cancer cells revealed that the tumor spread within the mucosal layer of the stomach. No lymph node metastasis was found. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. We experienced a rare case of early gastric cancer associated with gastric sarcoidosis, which identified the troublesome issue that the assessment of depth of cancer invasion is difficult, because patients with longstanding gastric sarcoidosis may involve various degrees of fibrosis of the gastric wall.
