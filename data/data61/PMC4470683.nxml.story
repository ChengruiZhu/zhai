A deep understanding of a drug’s mechanisms of actions is essential not only in the discovery of new treatments but also in minimizing adverse effects. Here, we develop a computational framework, the Drug-specific Signaling Pathway Network (DSPathNet), to reconstruct a comprehensive signaling pathway network (SPNetwork) impacted by a particular drug. To illustrate this computational approach, we used metformin, an anti-diabetic drug, as an example. Starting from collecting the metformin-related upstream genes and inferring the metformin-related downstream genes, we built one metformin-specific SPNetwork via random walk based algorithms. Our evaluation of the metformin-specific SPNetwork by using disease genes and genotyping data from genome-wide association studies showed that our DSPathNet approach was efficient to synopsize drug’s key components and their relationship involved in the type 2 diabetes and cancer, even the metformin anticancer activity. This work presents a novel computational framework for constructing individual drug-specific signal transduction networks. Furthermore, its successful application to the drug metformin provides some valuable insights into the mode of metformin action, which will facilitate our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying drug treatments, disease pathogenesis, and identification of novel drug targets and repurposed drugs.
