Amenamevir is a potent helicase–primase inhibitor and a novel class of antiviral agent other than nucleoside compounds, such as aciclovir, valaciclovir and famciclovir. This study is the first randomized, double‐blind, valaciclovir‐controlled phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of amenamevir in Japanese patients with herpes zoster when treated within 72 h after onset of rash. A total of 751 patients were randomly assigned to receive either amenamevir 400 mg or 200 mg p.o. once daily or valaciclovir 1000 mg three times daily (daily dose, 3000 mg) for 7 days. The primary efficacy end‐point was the proportion of cessation of new lesion formation by day 4 (“day 4 cessation proportion”). The day 4 cessation proportions for amenamevir 400 and 200 mg and valaciclovir were 81.1% (197/243), 69.6% (172/247) and 75.1% (184/245), respectively. Non‐inferiority of amenamevir 400 mg to valaciclovir was confirmed by a closed testing procedure. Days to cessation of new lesion formation, complete crusting, healing, pain resolution and virus disappearance were evaluated as secondary end‐points. No significant differences were observed in any of the treatment groups. Amenamevir 400 and 200 mg were well tolerated as well as valaciclovir. The proportions of patients who experienced drug‐related adverse events were 10.0% (25/249), 10.7% (27/252) and 12.0% (30/249) with amenamevir 400 and 200 mg and valaciclovir, respectively. In conclusion, amenamevir 400 mg appears to be effective and well tolerated for treatment of herpes zoster in immunocompetent Japanese patients.
