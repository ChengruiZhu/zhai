Stromal cells actively modulate the inflammatory process, in part by influencing the ability of neighboring endothelial cells to support the recruitment of circulating leukocytes. We hypothesized that podocytes influence the ability of glomerular endothelial cells (GEnCs) to recruit neutrophils during inflammation. To address this, human podocytes and human GEnCs were cultured on opposite sides of porous inserts and then treated with or without increasing concentrations of TNF-α prior to addition of neutrophils. The presence of podocytes significantly reduced neutrophil recruitment to GEnCs by up to 50% when cultures were treated with high-dose TNF-α (100 U/ml), when compared with GEnC monocultures. Importantly, this phenomenon was dependent on paracrine actions of soluble IL-6, predominantly released by podocytes. A similar response was absent when HUVECs were cocultured with podocytes, indicating a tissue-specific phenomenon. Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 elicited the immunosuppressive actions of IL-6 in a process that disrupted the presentation of chemokines on GEnCs by altering the expression of the duffy Ag receptor for chemokines. Interestingly, suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 knockdown in GEnCs upregulated duffy Ag receptor for chemokines and CXCL5 expression, thereby restoring the neutrophil recruitment. In summary, these studies reveal that podocytes can negatively regulate neutrophil recruitment to inflamed GEnCs by modulating IL-6 signaling, identifying a potential novel anti-inflammatory role of IL-6 in renal glomeruli.
