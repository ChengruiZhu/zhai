Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive cancer showing a very poor prognosis because of metastasis formation at an early stage and acquisition of chemoresistance. One key driver of chemoresistance is the transcription factor Forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1) that regulates cell cycle proliferation, maintenance of genomic stability, DNA damage response, and cell differentiation in numerous tumor entities. In this study we investigated the role of FOXM1 in SCLC progression and analyzed the effect of FOXM1 inhibition using two proteasome inhibitors, bortezomib and siomycin A. FOXM1 was strongly expressed in patient-derived SCLC samples (n=123) and its nuclear localization was associated with the proliferation marker Ki-67. Both proteasome inhibitors successfully inhibited FOXM1 expression leading to a significantly reduced proliferation and a decreased mitotic rate along with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction. These effects were further enhanced by addition of bortezomib to standard chemotherapy. Treatment of mice bearing chemoresistant SCLC xenografts with bortezomib reduced the mean bioluminescence signal of tumors by 54%. Similarly, treatment with cisplatin as a standard chemotherapy reduced the mean bioluminescence signal of tumors by 58%. However, in combination with standard chemotherapy bortezomib further reduced the mean bioluminescence signal by 93% (p=0.0258). In conclusion, we demonstrate the effect of bortezomib in inhibiting FOXM1 expression and thus in sensitizing resistant SCLC cells to standard chemotherapy. Thus, addition of bortezomib to standard chemotherapy might potently improve SCLC therapy, particularly in an extensive cancer stage.
