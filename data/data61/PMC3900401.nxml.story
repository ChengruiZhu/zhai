The prolyl 3-hydroxylase complex serves to hydroxylate a single residue in type I collagen and also serves as a collagen chaperone. The complex is comprised of prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1, cartilage associated protein, and cyclophilin B. Mutations have been identified in the genes encoding the complex members in patients with recessive Osteogenesis Imperfecta. Recent data suggest that prolyl 3-hydroxylation of collagen does not alter the stability of collagen but may rather mediate protein-protein interactions. Additionally, the collagen chaperoning function of the complex is an important rate limiting step in the modification of type I collagen. Irrespective of whether patients with mutations in the genes encoding the members of the prolyl 3-hydroxylase complex have hypomorphic or complete loss of function alleles, either circumstance leads to the loss of both functions of the prolyl 3-hydroxylase complex. Thus, it is unknown how collagen chaperoning and/or hydroxylation affect bone and cartilage homeostasis. In this study, we generated a mouse model lacking the prolyl 3-hydroxylation activity of the complex while maintaining the chaperoning function. We found that the hydroxylase mutant mice have normal cartilage and normal cortical bone but decreased trabecular bone, suggesting that there is a differential requirement for hydroxylation in different tissues.
